It is characterized by an abrupt onset of a permanent but non-progressive form of spastic paraparesis related to cassava consumption. It affects mainly children and breastfeeding mothers.\nText context: Konzo diagnosis: Konzo was diagnosed based on clinical criteria: symmetrical spastic paraparesis without sensory or genitourinary involvement, abrupt onset in less than 1 week with a non-progressive course, occurring in a cassava-growing area, usually with other cases emerging at the same time, and no other cause found.\nText context: disease_name: Cerebral Sparganosis\nText context: Neurolathyrism diagnosis: Upper motor neuron lesion with spastic paraparesis diagnosed after ruling out most compressive, hereditary, infectious, and metabolic myelopathies due to absence of radicular symptoms, sensory level, sphincter disturbance, back pain, non-progression, HIV-seronegativity, and negative family history.\nImage context: Konzo-related image: A 14-year-old boy from rural Tanzania with spastic paraparesis.

    "answer": "The boy's symptoms of acute-onset non-progressive spastic paraplegia, without sensory or genitourinary involvement, and the fact that cassava is the main staple food crop in his village, are consistent with Konzo disease, a distinct form of tropical spastic paraparesis related to cassava consumption. The abrupt onset and non-progressive course of the disease, along with its occurrence in a cassava-growing area, further support this diagnosis. Therefore, the disease diagnosis is Konzo."
