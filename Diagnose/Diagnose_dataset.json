In April 2014, he and his team established an EVD care unit in Monrovia, and patients with confirmed EVD began arriving at this facility on June 11, 2014. On July 23, 2014, he awoke feeling febrile and fatigued; his oral temperature was 37.8°C. He reported his symptoms to colleagues and remained at home. Results on two rapid diagnostic tests for malaria (Standard Diagnostics) were negative. He started empirical malaria treatment with artemether and lumefantrine. Later that day, his oral temperature was 38.6°C, and nausea developed. He was tested for malaria by means of a rapid diagnostic test and for yellow fever, Lassa fever, and EBOV by means of semiquantitative real-time reverse-transcriptase–polymerase-chain-reaction (RT-PCR) assays, all of which were performed at the Liberian National Reference Laboratory. The results for all the tests were negative.",

Early testing for EBOV can be falsely negative because viral loads may be below the detection threshold in the first days of illness. The epidemiologic context and compatible clinical presentation strongly support Ebola virus disease over other tropical infections.",

Empirical ceftriaxone was started, but a truncal rash developed. Oral azithromycin was substituted but caused hand swelling; her treatment was successfully changed to oral levofloxacin.

While there, the man tracked chimpanzees and gorillas, and visited the Marangambo Forest python cave. Fruit bats were flying in and out of the cave, but he was not touched, bitten, or scratched by the bats. Later, he ate goat stew containing intestine at a local hotel and swam in a local lake. No one fell ill during the trip. The man developed fever 12 days after visiting the python cave, 11 days after eating goat stew, and 10 days after lake swimming. Prior to travel, he was vaccinated against hepatitis A, polio, typhoid, and yellow fever. He took doxycycline as malaria prophylaxis, but admits to missing a couple of doses. At presentation, physical examination is normal except for a temperature of 40.1°C (104.2°F) and relative bradycardia (79 beats per minute). Based on his exposure history and the pulse-temperature dissociation, typhoid fever is diagnosed and ceftriaxone begun. Blood examination demonstrates mild leukopenia (2.9 x 10⁹ cells/L), moderate thrombocytopenia (66 x 10⁹ cells/L) and mildly elevated alanine aminotransferase (146 U/L) and aspartate aminotransferase (137 U/L). Rapid diagnostic testing for malaria is negative.  On hospital day 2, the man develops profuse watery diarrhoea, nausea, and vomiting, and viral gastroenteritides are considered.

The patient worked as a mechanic, had no pets, no recent travel history and no unusual contacts or hobbies. In the preceding 4 weeks and prior to his deterioration, he had presented on two separate occasions to a hospital emergency department – once to hospital A and once to hospital B, a different hospital in the city. At the first visit, which was to hospital A, the patient reported a mild headache, which responded to analgesia with no red flag symptoms. Blood tests were taken, including a routine opt-out bloodborne viral (BBV) screen. The patient was discharged from the ED. The BBV screen was subsequently reported as reactive for HIV antigen and antibody. Multiple unsuccessful attempts were made by staff to contact the patient by telephone and post. Two weeks later, the patient was brought back to the emergency department of hospital A. He presented with reduced consciousness. The patient’s housemates, who accompanied him to the hospital, reported worsening drowsiness over the preceding days. On initial examination, Glasgow Coma Scale (GCS) was 12/15, with unequal pupils. His temperature was 40.0°C and his heart rate was 120 beats per minute. Initial oxygen saturation was 99% in room air. One hour after presentation, GCS deteriorated from 12 to 6.

The physical exam during his current presentation revealed marked edema of the distal right lower extremity, multiple granulomatous foci, and two well-healed scars along the medial and lateral aspects of the calf, attributable to his previous surgical debridement from 2018 (Figure 1). He had full strength and sensation in the affected extremity without any discernible deficits. There were no signs indicative of a systemic infection, and the patient’s vital signs remained stable. A computed tomography (CT) scan was completed, showing superficial compartment edema of the posterior distal lower extremity, along with an irregular heterogenous collection in the posteriomedial calf (Figure 2). Given the uncertainty regarding deep compartment involvement and the high suspicion of a developing abscess due to a recurrent Nocardia spp. infection, the patient was subsequently taken to the operating room.

He had a normal vestibulo‐ocular reflex, positive corneal reflex, no facial asymmetry, the gag reflex was preserved, and in response to painful stimulus on the sternum, he showed withdrawal response bilaterally. He had nuchal rigidity with positive Brudzinski and Kernig signs. His arterial blood gas results showed a pH of 7.512, pCO2 of 30.8 mmHg, pO2 of 80.2 mmHg, and an HCO3 of 24.1 nmol/L. The laboratory results were significant with the WBC count of 13,000 cells/μL, the lactic acid was 2.49 mmol/L (0.5–2.2 mmol/L), and the potassium was 2.7 mmol/L (3.6–5.2 mmol/L).* The other laboratory parameters including hemoglobin, platelets, renal function, liver function, coagulation profile and cardiac enzymes were within normal limits. Initial brain computerized tomography (CT) scan showed no significant abnormality. Following the brain CT, a lumbar puncture was performed. The appearance of the CSF was a thick yellow liquid resembling pus (Figure 2). The CSF WBC count was 158,000 cells/μL (0–5 cells/μL), the CSF protein 18.67 mg/mL (0.15 to 0.6 mg/mL), the CSF lactic acid 42.37 mmol/L (0–3 mmol/L), the CSF glucose 0.1 mg/100 mL (50–80 mg/100 mL), the CSF RBCs were less than 1 RBC/mm3 (<1 RBC/mm3), and the CSF culture indicated S. pneumoniae (see endnote 1). He was started on a regimen with intravenous meropenem 2000 mg every 8 h and intravenous vancomycin 1200 mg every 8 h, and dexamethasone 12 mg every 6 h. He was also given one dose of intravenous metronidazole 1200 mg once. Intravenous ceftriaxone 2000 mg every 12 h was also added to the regimen. Due to respiratory failure, he was intubated with an endotracheal tube and transferred to an intensive care unit. On the second day of admission, his level of consciousness deteriorated, and his Glasgow Coma Scale (GCS) was 3 out of 15. A repeated brain CT scan showed multiple hypodensities and brain venogram revealed multiple filling defects in the superior sagittal sinus and left transverse sinus (Figure 3). The brain magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) showed extensive gyriform diffusion restriction abnormality involving the frontal, anterior temporal lobes, insular cortices, and bilateral deep gray nuclei and brainstem suggestive of meningoencephalitis with gyriform hemorrhagic foci in the insula and frontal lobes Multiple small collections were also noted along the leptomeningeal surface of the brain stem and cerebellar convexities representing exudates.",

    "ground_truth": "The patient presented with an acute febrile illness, severe headache, altered mental status, and classic meningeal signs (neck stiffness, positive Kernig and Brudzinski signs). Cerebrospinal fluid analysis showed purulent appearance, extremely elevated leukocyte count, markedly increased protein, very low glucose, and high lactate, all characteristic of acute bacterial meningitis. Definitive diagnosis was confirmed by CSF culture growing Streptococcus pneumoniae, consistent with his risk factors of chronic otitis media and prior neurosurgical complications.",
