Clinical presentation can include non-specific symptoms and rapidly progress to haemorrhage, multiple organ dysfunction, and shock. Important differential diagnoses include malaria, typhoid fever, bacterial gastroenteritis, and leptospirosis. The diagnosis is confirmed by detection of Ebola virus using ELISA antigen and PCR tests from blood or other body fluids, supported by relevant epidemiological exposure. The disease is caused by exposure to infected bat excreta or saliva, non-human primates, or person-to-person transmission in settings of inadequate universal precautions. Treatment is supportive, with antimalarials and broad-spectrum antibiotics given until the diagnosis of viral HF is confirmed.\\n'"

In April 2014, he and his team established an EVD care unit in Monrovia, and patients with confirmed EVD began arriving at this facility on June 11, 2014. On July 23, 2014, he awoke feeling febrile and fatigued; his oral temperature was 37.8°C. He reported his symptoms to colleagues and remained at home. Results on two rapid diagnostic tests for malaria (Standard Diagnostics) were negative. He started empirical malaria treatment with artemether and lumefantrine. Later that day, his oral temperature was 38.6°C, and nausea developed. He was tested for malaria by means of a rapid diagnostic test and for yellow fever, Lassa fever, and EBOV by means of semiquantitative real-time reverse-transcriptase–polymerase-chain-reaction (RT-PCR) assays, all of which were performed at the Liberian National Reference Laboratory.

In April 2014, he and his team established an EVD care unit in Monrovia, and patients with confirmed EVD began arriving at this facility on June 11, 2014. On July 23, 2014, he awoke feeling febrile and fatigued; his oral temperature was 37.8°C. He reported his symptoms to colleagues and remained at home. Results on two rapid diagnostic tests for malaria (Standard Diagnostics) were negative. He started empirical malaria treatment with artemether and lumefantrine. Later that day, his oral temperature was 38.6°C, and nausea developed. He was tested for malaria by means of a rapid diagnostic test and for yellow fever, Lassa fever, and EBOV by means of semiquantitative real-time reverse-transcriptase–polymerase-chain-reaction (RT-PCR) assays, all of which were performed at the Liberian National Reference Laboratory.

The patient's presentation with acute onset of high fever, severe headache, myalgia, retro-orbital pain, nausea, maculopapular rash, and mild thrombocytopenia are consistent with Yellow Fever. Additionally, the patient's recent travel to rural West Africa, a region where Yellow Fever is endemic, increases the likelihood of this diagnosis. Yellow Fever is a viral hemorrhagic fever that can cause liver failure, characterized by fever, jaundice, bleeding, encephalopathy, and seizures, which aligns with the patient's symptoms.\\n\\nOther possible diagnoses, such as Dengue and Chikungunya, should also be considered, but Yellow Fever is a more likely diagnosis given the patient's travel history and symptoms. Lassa fever is less likely, as it typically presents with additional symptoms such as sore throat and retrosternal chest pain, which are not mentioned in the patient's presentation. Rift Valley fever is also a possibility, but it is less common in West Africa and typically presents with more severe symptoms such as hemorrhagic fever or encephalitis.\",\n",
              "  'contexts': \"Lassa fever is common in sub-Saharan West Africa and is thought to infect approximately 300,000 people annually. The symptoms include fever, body aches, weakness, sore throat, retrosternal chest pain, abdominal pain, diarrhea, vomiting, cough, and breathlessness, with conjunctivitis often occurring late in the disease. The disease is more severe in pregnant women, and its severity is marked by raised liver transaminases. Clinically, it is characterized by a high case fatality rate in hospitalized patients, with a particularly high case fatality rate in the third trimester of pregnancy. The diagnosis is confirmed by antigen testing, PCR, or serological tests, with the treatment being with IV ribavirin, most effective when given early in the disease. Important differential diagnoses include adenovirus infections, measles, Mycoplasma pneumoniae, Leptospirosis, and typhoid fever.\\nLoiasis, the symptomatic infection with the filarial nematode L. loa, primarily occurs in West and Central Africa. It presents with urticaria and transient painless subcutaneous swellings ('Calabar swellings'), a localized angioedema which may last from several hours to a few days. Adult worms may be spotted when migrating through the bulbar conjunctiva, causing intense itching, pain, and photophobia. Renal complications, such as glomerulonephritis and nephrotic syndrome, and a wide range of neurological symptoms have also been observed. The female worms release sheathed microfilariae detectable in the peripheral blood during daytime. Laboratory diagnosis relies on detecting microfilariae in a thick blood film or filtered blood, or using PCR (polymerase chain reaction) in amicrofilaraemic patients. Serology is not reliable due to cross-reactions with antibodies against other nematodes. Treatment with diethylcarbamazine (DEC), ivermectin, and albendazole may have severe side effects in patients with high levels of microfilariae, so sequential treatment is suggested based on the degree of microfilaraemia.\\nThis patient presents with an acute febrile illness that produces liver failure characterized by fever, jaundice, bleeding, encephalopathy, and seizures. Key findings include elevated liver transaminases, jaundice, spontaneous bleeding, and low hematocrit. The differential diagnosis includes viral hepatitis, malaria, dengue fever, leptospirosis, and severe yellow fever. Important laboratory tests for diagnosis include serial thick blood smears, dengue NS1 and IgM, blood cultures, PCR for leptospirosis, and IgM antibodies for viral hepatitis. The patient eventually died of yellow fever, as confirmed by highly positive IgM capture ELISA.\\n\\nDengue virus disease typically presents with high fever, headache, myalgia, and thrombocytopenia, with warning signs for severe disease including abdominal pain, vomiting, fluid accumulation, mucosal bleeding, lethargy or restlessness, and increasing haematocrit with concurrent worsening of thrombocytopenia. Clinically, it is characterized by rapid progression to shock and multi-organ dysfunction. Important differential diagnoses include scrub typhus, leptospirosis, and melioidosis. The diagnosis is confirmed by detection of the NS1 antigen by RDTs or ELISA, detection of viral RNA using RT-PCR, or paired serology tests for IgM/IgG demonstrating seroconversion.\\nThe disease primarily occurs in hot spots around the world, including Eastern Europe, the Middle East, Central and South Asia, Central and South America, and Africa. The patient initially presents with non-specific symptoms such as fever, sweating, fatigue, weight loss, headache, and joint pain, which persisted for weeks or months. The disease may involve nearly every organ of the body, and endocarditis is a less common but serious manifestation. A definitive diagnosis requires the isolation of the bacteria from the blood, body fluids, or tissues, which can be challenging as culture may take several weeks. Importantly, brucellosis should be considered in differential diagnosis in geographical regions where malaria and tuberculosis are highly prevalent and diagnostic resources are scarce, such as in sub-Saharan Africa.\\nThis patient presents with an acute febrile illness that produces liver failure characterized by fever, jaundice, bleeding, encephalopathy, and seizures. Key findings include elevated liver transaminases, jaundice, spontaneous bleeding, and low hematocrit.

The patient eventually died of yellow fever, as confirmed by highly positive IgM capture ELISA.\\n\\nCholangiocarcinoma (CCA) primarily occurs in the Greater Mekong subregion, Southeast Asia, East Asia, and Kazakhstan, and is strongly associated with chronic liver fluke infection by Opisthorchis viverrini or Clonorchis sinensis. Symptoms may be absent or non-specific, including a single solitary liver mass. Differential diagnoses include hepatocellular carcinoma, metastatic tumour, and certain infections. Key findings for diagnosis include a solitary liver mass on imaging, elevated CA19-9 level, and detection of liver flukes or histological examination of the tumour showing infiltrative compact glandular structures. Important additional information to obtain from the patient includes a history of eating raw or undercooked freshwater fish containing metacercariae of the parasites, which is a risk factor for infection.\\nChagas disease primarily occurs in 21 Latin American countries, including Bolivia, and is caused by the protozoan Trypanosoma cruzi. Clinical presentation includes inflammation at the inoculation point and fever in the acute phase, and asymptomatic or mild-to-moderate organ involvement in the chronic phase. The heart is the most frequent organ involved, with manifestations such as bundle branch blocks, myocardial damage, and dilated cardiomyopathy. Key findings to diagnose Chagas disease include detection of IgG antibodies against T. cruzi using two different serological testing methods, direct microscopic visualization of trypomastigotes on blood films, or PCR with varying sensitivities. Differential diagnosis includes other diseases that may present with similar symptoms, such as myocardial damage or dilated cardiomyopathy. Treatment of Chagas disease involves trypanocidal medication, such as benznidazole or nifurtimox, which may be associated with adverse events. Important indications for treatment include acute and congenital Chagas disease, and patients younger than 18 years in the chronic phase.\\nA 51-year-old female traveller returning from Central America presents with a generalized slightly pruritic maculopapular rash, conjunctivitis, peripheral painful oedema, and generalized lymphadenopathy. The clinical presentation is highly suggestive of an arboviral infection. The diagnosis is confirmed by detection of Zika virus RNA using RT-PCR and seroconversion of IgM and IgG antibodies in acute and convalescent serum samples. Differential diagnoses include dengue and chikungunya infections.\\n\\nThis patient presents with an acute febrile illness that produces liver failure characterized by fever, jaundice, bleeding, encephalopathy, and seizures.

Hypotension and shock are also present. Bilateral conjunctivitis and no rash or lymphadenopathy are notable findings. The patient's husband died of a similar illness recently, raising the suspicion of viral haemorrhagic fever, particularly Marburg virus disease or Ebola virus disease. Differential diagnoses include malaria, typhoid fever, bacterial sepsis, measles, Zika virus, and other viral infections. The diagnosis is confirmed by detection of Marburg virus RNA or Ebola virus RNA using PCR from blood or other body fluids, with a low parasitaemia of Plasmodium falciparum. Important findings include conjunctivitis, retrosternal chest pain, and abdominal symptoms, which are indicative of the viral haemorrhagic fever.\\nA 32-year-old woman from Nigeria presents with fever, jaundice, and confusion 18 days after returning from a visit to rural Nigeria. The most common cause of fever and jaundice in West Africa is severe falciparum malaria. A malaria blood film is crucial to confirm the diagnosis, and the patient should be treated as malaria and other tests taken with standard universal precautions. Severe malaria is a life-threatening infection in non-immune patients and should be on the list of differential diagnoses for any unwell patient from the tropics.

A characteristic inoculation eschar at the site of the tick bite with local lymphadenopathy is often observed. Other possible diagnoses include malaria, and the diagnosis typically made clinically. PCR from the eschar scab or even a skin swab is useful for confirming the diagnosis. Differential diagnoses include malaria, scrub typhus, epidemic typhus, and murine typhus. The diagnosis is confirmed by PCR or serodiagnosis, and treatment is usually not necessary in mild cases, but doxycycline may be given to speed up recovery;\\n\\n\"},\n",

              "  'contexts': \"Cerebral malaria is a severe neurological complication of Plasmodium falciparum infection, primarily occurring in sub-Saharan Africa. It presents with coma, no neurological localizing signs, hepatosplenomegaly, and a positive malaria rapid diagnostic test. Key findings for diagnosis include retinal whitening, hemorrhages, or orange-white vessels with or without papilloedema on ophthalmoscopy. Important differential diagnoses include bacterial meningitis, viral encephalitis, intoxication, metabolic abnormalities, and non-convulsive status epilepticus. The diagnosis is confirmed by the presence of Plasmodium falciparum parasitemia and the absence of other causes of coma, with supportive findings of malarial retinopathy on ophthalmoscopy. The mainstay of therapy is antimalarials, intensive supportive care, and diagnosis and treatment of non-malarial contributors to illness.\\nKnowlesi malaria primarily presents with fever, thrombocytopenia, and non-specific arthralgias, and is characterized by a quotidian (daily) fever pattern with relatively high parasitaemias. The differential diagnosis includes dengue fever, chikungunya, Zika, influenza, acute HIV infection, enteric fever, and non-falciparum malaria, especially given the negative rapid diagnostic test for malaria. Diagnosis is confirmed by microscopy or PCR-based methods that distinguish *P. knowlesi* from other *Plasmodium species*, and treatment is the same as for acute falciparum malaria.\\nA 32-year-old woman from Nigeria presents with fever, jaundice, and confusion 18 days after returning from a visit to rural Nigeria. The most common cause of fever and jaundice in West Africa is severe falciparum malaria. A malaria blood film is crucial to confirm the diagnosis, and the patient should be treated as malaria and other tests taken with standard universal precautions. Severe malaria is a life-threatening infection in non-immune patients and should be on the list of differential diagnoses for any unwell patient from the tropics. Early diagnosis and effective antimalarial drugs are key to malaria management.\\n\\nBartonellosis, caused by B. bacilliformis, is a vector-borne disease mainly found in the Andean valleys of Peru, transmitted by female sandflies. The disease is characterized by a severe haemolytic anaemia with jaundice, high fever, malaise, myalgias, and CNS involvement. It progresses to a chronic angioproliferative cutaneous stage ('verruga peruana') in approximately 5% of treated patients and an unknown percentage of untreated individuals. Diagnosis is made by proof of cocco-bacilli inside red blood cells, while treatment of the acute phase includes ciprofloxacin alone or combined with ceftriaxone in severe cases. The differential diagnoses include malaria and bartonellosis, as well as several non-infectious causes of haemolysis.\\nMelioidosis is caused by the bacterium Burkholderia pseudomallei, which endemic to South and South-east Asia, and northern Australia. The patient presents with fever, headache, generalized myalgia and arthralgia, a painful swelling over the left scapula, and bilateral pleural effusions. Clinically, it is characterized by sepsis, pneumonia, skin and soft tissue abscesses, and disseminated abscess formation. Important differential diagnoses include bacterial abscess with sepsis, tuberculosis, and disseminated fungal infection. The diagnosis is confirmed by isolation and identification of B. pseudomallei in clinical samples, which may be achieved by various laboratory methods such as microscopy, culture, PCR on clinical specimens, immunofluorescence, and lateral flow immunoassay, antigen latex agglutination on isolates. Blood culture, abscess swab, throat swab, and imaging studies such as chest X-ray and ultrasound are also essential for diagnosis. Treatment involves parenteral antibiotics (e.g. ceftazidime, meropenem) for 2 weeks, followed by oral co-trimoxazole to complete 3 to 6 months eradication therapy.\\nChronic paracoccidioidomycosis is a systemic fungal infection endemic to moist tropical regions of Latin America, primarily affecting middle-aged men living in rural areas. The disease presents with slow progression of pulmonary symptoms over months, often accompanied by mucosal lesions. The diagnosis is confirmed by visualization of P. brasiliensis on KOH preparation or isolation in fungal culture. The treatment includes azoles for mild and moderate cases, with itraconazole being the drug of choice, and amphotericin B for severe and extensive disease. Important differential diagnoses include other chronic fungal infections, pulmonary tuberculosis, and leukaemia/lymphoma. Key findings to diagnose chronic paracoccidioidomycosis include presence of P. brasiliensis on KOH preparation or in fungal culture, positive serology, and characteristic clinical presentation.\\n\\nCutaneous leishmaniasis typically occurs in areas where sand flies are present, such as the Andes in Peru. It presents as a localized painless ulcer with raised edges, often on exposed parts of the skin. The diagnosis is confirmed by demonstration of the parasite using microscopic examination, culture or molecular techniques. Differential diagnoses include sporotrichosis, cutaneous tuberculosis, and infection by Balamuthia mandrillaris. The treatment involves systemic therapy with first-line drugs such as pentavalent antimonials, and second-line drugs like Amphotericin B or liposomal Amphotericin B may be considered, especially for L. (V.) braziliensis infection.\\nVisceral Leishmaniasis primarily occurs in East Africa and the Indian subcontinent, particularly in five countries (India, Sudan, South Sudan, Ethiopia, and Brazil). The clinical presentation includes chronic fever, fatigue, anorexia, weight loss, enlarged lymph nodes, splenomegaly, and hepatomegaly. It typically presents in 2-8 months after the sandfly bite. Laboratory results show pancytopenia, with depletion of all three cell lines in the FBC. A direct proof of the parasite is the classic confirmatory test for VL, but in low-resource settings, serological tests are often used instead, such as the rK39 immuno-chromatographic test (ICT), the Direct Agglutination Test (DAT), and semiquantitative DAT. The diagnosis is challenging due to variable sensitivity and specificity of these tests. The most important differential diagnoses include malaria, brucellosis, tuberculosis, HIV infection, typhoid fever, splenic abscess, chronic schistosomiasis, and malignancies. The key findings to diagnose this exact disease include a positive Direct Agglutination Test or semiquantitative DAT with a high titre, and demonstration of Leishmania amastigotes in samples from the bone marrow, spleen, and lymph node.\\nLoiasis, the symptomatic infection with the filarial nematode L. loa, primarily occurs in West and Central Africa. It presents with urticaria and transient painless subcutaneous swellings ('Calabar swellings'), a localized angioedema which may last from several hours to a few days.

However, the presence of fever, headache, puffy face, and an erythematous rash suggested trypanosomiasis. The diagnosis was confirmed by the presence of trypanosomes in a thick blood film, and the patient was treated with suramin. The rapid progression to neurological involvement was indicated by the presence of trypanosomes in the cerebrospinal fluid (CSF), and treatment was switched to melarsoprol. Key findings that led to the diagnosis of trypanosomiasis include the presence of trypanosomes in the blood and CSF, and the patient's exposure to tsetse flies in a national game park. Important differential diagnoses include hypersensitivity reactions, invasive helminthiasis, and rickettsial disease.\\nChagas disease primarily occurs in 21 Latin American countries, including Bolivia, and is caused by the protozoan Trypanosoma cruzi. Clinical presentation includes inflammation at the inoculation point and fever in the acute phase, and asymptomatic or mild-to-moderate organ involvement in the chronic phase.

Important indications for treatment include acute and congenital Chagas disease, and patients younger than 18 years in the chronic phase.\\nParagonimiasis is a sub-acute to chronic lung disease caused by lung flukes of the genus Paragonimus. Adult flukes live in the lungs and eggs are coughed up and either expectorated or swallowed. The disease occurs mainly via consuming raw or undercooked freshwater crabs or crayfish contaminated with Paragonimus metacercariae or eating raw wild boar meat, which is a paratenic host. Eosinophilia is prominent during acute and sub-acute infection but may be mild or absent in chronic disease. Definitive diagnosis is made by detection of ova in sputum, BAL fluid or faeces. Praziquantel is the drug of choice, effective against all Paragonimus species. Important differential diagnoses include pulmonary tuberculosis and lung cancer.\\n\\nSpinal cord schistosomiasis is a condition that primarily occurs in endemic areas of tropical Africa, including Malawi, where the patient in the case report lives. The symptoms include difficulty passing urine, constipation, erectile dysfunction, significant weight loss, and fatigue. The diagnosis is confirmed by the presence of Schistosoma haematobium eggs in the urine, along with eosinophilia and abnormalities in the bladder wall on MRI scanning. Clinically, it presents as a conus syndrome, characterized by bladder retention, constipation, and erectile dysfunction. Important differential diagnoses include spinal tuberculosis, spinal abscess, and neurosyphilis. Key findings to diagnose this disease include detection of Schistosoma haematobium eggs, eosinophilia, and abnormalities in the bladder wall on MRI scanning.\\nSchistosoma haematobium causes genitourinary schistosomiasis, primarily occurring in endemic parts of Africa and the Middle East. Initially presenting with urinary symptoms such as dysuria and nocturia, patients may progress to chronic kidney disease characterized by hydronephrosis, renal failure, and obstructive uropathy. The diagnosis is challenging and mainly depends on ultrasound findings, cystoscopy (hyperaemic mucosa with 'sandy patches'), and clinical presentation. Important differential diagnosis includes bacterial pyelonephritis, and end-stage renal disease. The diagnosis of schistosomiasis can be established by observing the circulating anodic antigen (CAA), which is currently under development.\\nAcute schistosomiasis (Katayama syndrome) typically occurs 2 to 12 weeks after Schistosoma infection, and presents with fever, urticaria, cough, and eosinophilia. Patchy pulmonary infiltrates or micronodular changes in the lower lung zones may be present on chest radiograph. The diagnosis is challenging due to the lack of Schistosoma ova in urine or stool at the early stage and delayed serological tests. PCR-based methods may be useful for the diagnosis. Praziquantel treatment should be delayed until the flukes are adult, and supportive steroid therapy may be necessary for severe symptoms or neurological complications.\\n\\n\"}}"

He had a past medical history of uncontrolled diabetes mellitus, hypertension, bronchial asthma, and chronic otitis media. He required an automastoidectomy for the chronic otitis media, complicated by a tegmen tympani defect and secondary pseudomeningocele formation communicating with the left temporal horn He had bacterial meningitis 6\\u2009years ago, complicated by hydrocephalus that required a temporary external ventricular shunt placement. The patient was initially managed as a case of upper respiratory tract infection and discharged on the same day with a course of oral antibiotics. He returned to the emergency room 1 day later because of worsening headache and vomiting associated with altered sensorium. The patient was well built but sick‐looking. His systolic blood pressure was 160/75\\u2009mm Hg, heart rate 110 beats/min, respiratory rate 27/min, the temperature 38°C, and oxygen saturation 96% at room air. His initial neurological examination revealed no eye‐opening to pain, and he produced sounds only as a verbal response. His pupils' size was 4\\u2009mm and reactive to light, and he blinked to a threat in both eyes. With the fundus examination, there was bilateral papilledema. He had a normal vestibulo‐ocular reflex, positive corneal reflex, no facial asymmetry, the gag reflex was preserved, and in response to painful stimulus on the sternum, he showed withdrawal response bilaterally. He had nuchal rigidity with positive Brudzinski and Kernig signs. His arterial blood gas results showed a pH of 7.512, pCO2 of 30.8\\u2009mmHg, pO2 of 80.2\\u2009mmHg, and an HCO3 of 24.1\\u2009nmol/L. The laboratory results were significant with the WBC count of 13,000 cells/μL, the lactic acid was 2.49\\u2009mmol/L (0.5–2.2\\u2009mmol/L), and the potassium was 2.7\\u2009mmol/L (3.6–5.2\\u2009mmol/L).* The other laboratory parameters including hemoglobin, platelets, renal function, liver function, coagulation profile and cardiac enzymes were within normal limits. Initial brain computerized tomography (CT) scan showed no significant abnormality. Following the brain CT, a lumbar puncture was performed. The appearance of the CSF was a thick yellow liquid resembling pus (Figure 2). The CSF WBC count was 158,000 cells/μL (0–5 cells/μL), the CSF protein 18.67\\u2009mg/mL (0.15 to 0.6\\u2009mg/mL), the CSF lactic acid 42.37\\u2009mmol/L (0–3\\u2009mmol/L), the CSF glucose 0.1\\u2009mg/100\\u2009mL (50–80\\u2009mg/100\\u2009mL), the CSF RBCs were less than 1 RBC/mm3 (<1 RBC/mm3), and the CSF culture indicated S. pneumoniae (see endnote 1). He was started on a regimen with intravenous meropenem 2000 mg every 8 h and intravenous vancomycin 1200\\u2009mg every 8\\u2009h, and dexamethasone 12\\u2009mg every 6\\u2009h. He was also given one dose of intravenous metronidazole 1200\\u2009mg once. Intravenous ceftriaxone 2000\\u2009mg every 12\\u2009h was also added to the regimen.

A repeated brain CT scan showed multiple hypodensities and brain venogram revealed multiple filling defects in the superior sagittal sinus and left transverse sinus (Figure 3). The brain magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) showed extensive gyriform diffusion restriction abnormality involving the frontal, anterior temporal lobes, insular cortices, and bilateral deep gray nuclei and brainstem suggestive of meningoencephalitis with gyriform hemorrhagic foci in the insula and frontal lobes Multiple small collections were also noted along the leptomeningeal surface of the brain stem and cerebellar convexities representing exudates.\",\n",

Later that day, his oral temperature was 38.6°C, and nausea developed. He was tested for malaria by means of a rapid diagnostic test and for yellow fever, Lassa fever, and EBOV by means of semiquantitative real-time reverse-transcriptase–polymerase-chain-reaction (RT-PCR) assays, all of which were performed at the Liberian National Reference Laboratory.

Clinical presentation can include non-specific symptoms and rapidly progress to haemorrhage, multiple organ dysfunction, and shock. Important differential diagnoses include malaria, typhoid fever, bacterial gastroenteritis, and leptospirosis. The diagnosis is confirmed by detection of Ebola virus using ELISA antigen and PCR tests from blood or other body fluids, supported by relevant epidemiological exposure. The disease is caused by exposure to infected bat excreta or saliva, non-human primates, or person-to-person transmission in settings of inadequate universal precautions. Treatment is supportive, with antimalarials and broad-spectrum antibiotics given until the diagnosis of viral HF is confirmed.\\nThe patient presents with a severe febrile illness, characterized by fever, sore throat, general body ache, retrosternal chest pain, abdominal symptoms, and conjunctivitis. Hypotension and shock are also present. Bilateral conjunctivitis and no rash or lymphadenopathy are notable findings. The patient's husband died of a similar illness recently, raising the suspicion of viral haemorrhagic fever, particularly Marburg virus disease or Ebola virus disease. Differential diagnoses include malaria, typhoid fever, bacterial sepsis, measles, Zika virus, and other viral infections. The diagnosis is confirmed by detection of Marburg virus RNA or Ebola virus RNA using PCR from blood or other body fluids, with a low parasitaemia of Plasmodium falciparum. Important findings include conjunctivitis, retrosternal chest pain, and abdominal symptoms, which are indicative of the viral haemorrhagic fever.\\nA 32-year-old woman from Nigeria presents with fever, jaundice, and confusion 18 days after returning from a visit to rural Nigeria. The most common cause of fever and jaundice in West Africa is severe falciparum malaria.

The symptoms include fever, body aches, weakness, sore throat, retrosternal chest pain, abdominal pain, diarrhea, vomiting, cough, and breathlessness, with conjunctivitis often occurring late in the disease. The disease is more severe in pregnant women, and its severity is marked by raised liver transaminases. Clinically, it is characterized by a high case fatality rate in hospitalized patients, with a particularly high case fatality rate in the third trimester of pregnancy. The diagnosis is confirmed by antigen testing, PCR, or serological tests, with the treatment being with IV ribavirin, most effective when given early in the disease. Important differential diagnoses include adenovirus infections, measles, Mycoplasma pneumoniae, Leptospirosis, and typhoid fever.\\nLoiasis, the symptomatic infection with the filarial nematode L. loa, primarily occurs in West and Central Africa. It presents with urticaria and transient painless subcutaneous swellings ('Calabar swellings'), a localized angioedema which may last from several hours to a few days. Adult worms may be spotted when migrating through the bulbar conjunctiva, causing intense itching, pain, and photophobia. Renal complications, such as glomerulonephritis and nephrotic syndrome, and a wide range of neurological symptoms have also been observed. The female worms release sheathed microfilariae detectable in the peripheral blood during daytime. Laboratory diagnosis relies on detecting microfilariae in a thick blood film or filtered blood, or using PCR (polymerase chain reaction) in amicrofilaraemic patients. Serology is not reliable due to cross-reactions with antibodies against other nematodes. Treatment with diethylcarbamazine (DEC), ivermectin, and albendazole may have severe side effects in patients with high levels of microfilariae, so sequential treatment is suggested based on the degree of microfilaraemia.\\nThis patient presents with an acute febrile illness that produces liver failure characterized by fever, jaundice, bleeding, encephalopathy, and seizures.

Focal brain lesions in HIV-infected individuals in tropical countries are broad, including HIV-related brain diseases such as cerebral toxoplasmosis, progressive multifocal leukoencephalopathy, CNS lymphoma, cryptococcoma, and CMV encephalitis. Cerebral TB, brain tumor, brain metastases, cerebral abscess, neurocysticercosis, neuroschistosomiasis, and Chagas' disease are also considered. The patient's clinical status worsened after ART initiation, consistent with immune reconstitution inflammatory syndrome (IRIS). A cerebral MRI showed multifocal T2 hyperintense lesions in the white matter, and a presumed diagnosis of PML was made. PML always occurs due to reactivation of the human JC polyomavirus, typically in immunosuppressed individuals, presenting with muscle weakness, sensory deficits, hemianopia, cognitive dysfunction, aphasia, and coordination and gait difficulties.

Symptoms include severe headache, paraesthesia of the trunk, limbs, or face, and a creeping eruption. Diagnosis is confirmed by a lumbar puncture revealing eosinophilic meningitis, with a high eosinophil count in the cerebrospinal fluid. Differential diagnoses include fungal meningitis, lymphoma, eosinophilic leukemia, sarcoid, and idiopathic hypereosinophilic syndrome. Key findings for diagnosis include a high Eosinophil count in the CSF, elevated IgE levels, and a positive western blot test for antibodies against the 31KD antigen of angiostrongylus cantonensis. Treatment is primarily supportive, with mild cases managed symptomatically and more severe cases treated with corticosteroids and antiparasitic drugs.\\nNeurocysticercosis presents with symptoms of focal epileptic seizures, with most common presentation being symptoms of 'pins and needles' sensation in a part of the body. It's caused by neurocysticercosis caused by the pork tapeworm Taenia solium, acquired after consuming food contaminated with T. solium eggs, which release oncospheres that infect the brain and form encysted larvae. Key findings to diagnose include neuroimaging showing multiple cystic lesions, supported by clinical presentation of focal seizures. Differential diagnoses in the context include hydrocephalus, cerebral oedema, and meningitis. The diagnosis is confirmed by serological and epidemiological evidence. Treatment includes antiparasitic drugs like albendazole or a combination of albendazole and praziquantel, in addition to steroid therapy.\\nCerebral sparganosis, a food-borne zoonosis, primarily occurs in Asian countries, particularly China, South Korea, Thailand, and Japan, and presents with symptoms suggestive of a space-occupying lesion, such as headache, confusion, seizures, paralysis, or palsies. Important differential diagnoses include brain tumours or metastases, neurocysticercosis, cerebral schistosomiasis, and paragonimiasis. Diagnosis is confirmed by dependant history taking and serological investigations, supplemented by neuroimaging, especially MRI, which often reveals the 'tunnel sign' with hypointensity in T1-weighted and hyperintensity in T2-weighted images. The most effective treatment is the removal of the sparganum from the brain. Praziquantel treatment may also be effective.\\n\\nEnteric fever, caused by Salmonella Typhi, is clinically indistinguishable from paratyphoid fever caused by Salmonella Paratyphi A, B, and C. It typically presents with nonspecific symptoms such as fever, headache, dry cough, and abdominal pain. The fever starts insidiously and may be afebrile in the morning, with constipation being common and foul-smelling diarrhea occurring in the course of an untreated infection. The diagnosis is confirmed by proof of S. Typhi in blood cultures or bone marrow, while stool or urine isolation indicates a carrier state. Empirical antibiotic therapy should be started promptly, with fluoroquinolones being the drugs of choice in areas without antimicrobial resistance. The case fatality rate on antibiotic treatment is less than 1%, and targeted vaccination of high-risk populations seems to be a promising strategy to control the disease. Important differential diagnoses include malaria and invasive nontyphoidal salmonellae (iNTS) infections in HIV-positive patients. The diagnosis and treatment of enteric fever are crucial in areas where the disease is endemic due to high morbidity and mortality rates.\\nScrub typhus is a common cause of pyrexia in large parts of Asia and northern Australia, transmitted by the bite of an infected larva (chigger) of a trombiculid mite. It presents with fever, severe headache, myalgia, regional or generalized lymphadenopathy, and a macular or maculopapular rash. CNS involvement is common, with presentations of diffuse encephalopathy or reversible sensorineural deafness. Diagnostic challenges require clinical suspicion and empirical antibiotic treatment. Serological tests, rapid diagnostic tests, ELISA, PCR, and culture are available for diagnosis. Standard treatment is with doxycycline 100 mg bid for 1 week.\\nInvasive non-typhoidal Salmonellae (iNTS) infection primarily presents with non-specific febrile illness, abdominal pain or history of diarrhea, mild splenomegaly, and severe anaemia. Clinically, it is characterized by aseptic fever, weight loss, and progressive weakness, with some patients reporting abdominal pain or history of diarrhea. Important differential diagnoses include typhoid and paratyphoid, malaria, and tuberculosis. The diagnosis is confirmed by detection of Salmonella enterica var Typhimurium in blood cultures, supported by relevant clinical presentation and epidemiological context. Severe anaemia is common and should prompt the clinician to look carefully for signs of TB co-infection.\\n\\nLeptospirosis is a zoonotic disease caused by pathogenic Leptospira species. The disease presents with a biphasic illness, initially non-specific symptoms such as fever, headache, and myalgias, followed by a second phase dominated by immune-mediated pathology. Classical presentation includes severe myalgias, subconjunctival hemorrhage, and jaundice. In severe cases, complications such as acute kidney injury, pulmonary involvement, and myocarditis may occur. Diagnosis is confirmed by PCR detection, MAT serology, or culture, and treatment involves antibiotics such as doxycycline, amoxicillin, or benzylpenicillin.\\nPaucibacillary leprosy primarily occurs in leprosy-endemic countries and typically presents with one or a few hypopigmented anaesthetic skin patches and thickened peripheral nerves. It is essential to consider the combination of a skin problem and signs of a neuropathy as a suspect for leprosy. Important differential diagnoses include various inflammatory or traumatic processes. Leprosy is diagnosed clinically, and the diagnosis is confirmed by skin biopsy and slit-skin smear. The diagnosis is also supported by the WHO categorization of leprosy according to the number of skin lesions, with paucibacillary leprosy being treated with rifampicin and dapsone once per month.\\nThe patient is a 55-year-old woman from Vietnam who presents with fever, headache, vomiting, confusion, and impaired consciousness.

Fruit bats were flying in and out of the cave, but he was not touched, bitten, or scratched by the bats. Later, he ate goat stew containing intestine at a local hotel and swam in a local lake. No one fell ill during the trip. The man developed fever 12 days after visiting the python cave, 11 days after eating goat stew, and 10 days after lake swimming. Prior to travel, he was vaccinated against hepatitis A, polio, typhoid, and yellow fever. He took doxycycline as malaria prophylaxis, but admits to missing a couple of doses. At presentation, physical examination is normal except for a temperature of 40.1°C (104.2°F) and relative bradycardia (79 beats per minute). Based on his exposure history and the pulse-temperature dissociation, typhoid fever is diagnosed and ceftriaxone begun. Blood examination demonstrates mild leukopenia (2.9 x 10⁹ cells/L), moderate thrombocytopenia (66 x 10⁹ cells/L) and mildly elevated alanine aminotransferase (146 U/L) and aspartate aminotransferase (137 U/L). Rapid diagnostic testing for malaria is negative.  On hospital day 2, the man develops profuse watery diarrhoea, nausea, and vomiting, and viral gastroenteritides are considered.

It presents with fever, severe headache, myalgia, regional or generalized lymphadenopathy, and a macular or maculopapular rash. CNS involvement is common, with presentations of diffuse encephalopathy or reversible sensorineural deafness. Diagnostic challenges require clinical suspicion and empirical antibiotic treatment. Serological tests, rapid diagnostic tests, ELISA, PCR, and culture are available for diagnosis. Standard treatment is with doxycycline 100 mg bid for 1 week.\\nRabies is a viral infection caused by the Lyssavirus genus, transmitted through the bite of infected mammals, with an incubation period of 20-90 days. The paralytic form of rabies initially presents with fever, paraesthesia in the bitten limb, followed by rapid progression to quadriparesis, particularly proximal muscle involvement. Clinically, it may mimic Guillain Barre syndrome, post-vaccination encephalomyelitis, and other conditions. Laboratory confirmation involves testing for rabies-specific antibodies in saliva, CSF, or serum, and detection of viral RNA by RT-PCR from saliva or nuchal skin biopsy. Important differential diagnoses include Guillain Barre syndrome, post-vaccination encephalomyelitis, and other conditions listed in Table 91.1. The diagnosis is confirmed by detection of rabies-specific antibodies in CSF and serum, or by antigen detection using direct fluorescent antibody (dFA) test or RT-PCR on brain tissue obtained post-mortem.\\nA 51-year-old female traveller returning from Central America presents with a generalized slightly pruritic maculopapular rash, conjunctivitis, peripheral painful oedema, and generalized lymphadenopathy. The clinical presentation is highly suggestive of an arboviral infection. The diagnosis is confirmed by detection of Zika virus RNA using RT-PCR and seroconversion of IgM and IgG antibodies in acute and convalescent serum samples. Differential diagnoses include dengue and chikungunya infections.\\n\\nLassa fever is common in sub-Saharan West Africa and is thought to infect approximately 300,000 people annually. The symptoms include fever, body aches, weakness, sore throat, retrosternal chest pain, abdominal pain, diarrhea, vomiting, cough, and breathlessness, with conjunctivitis often occurring late in the disease. The disease is more severe in pregnant women, and its severity is marked by raised liver transaminases. Clinically, it is characterized by a high case fatality rate in hospitalized patients, with a particularly high case fatality rate in the third trimester of pregnancy. The diagnosis is confirmed by antigen testing, PCR, or serological tests, with the treatment being with IV ribavirin, most effective when given early in the disease. Important differential diagnoses include adenovirus infections, measles, Mycoplasma pneumoniae, Leptospirosis, and typhoid fever.\\nLoiasis, the symptomatic infection with the filarial nematode L. loa, primarily occurs in West and Central Africa. It presents with urticaria and transient painless subcutaneous swellings ('Calabar swellings'), a localized angioedema which may last from several hours to a few days. Adult worms may be spotted when migrating through the bulbar conjunctiva, causing intense itching, pain, and photophobia. Renal complications, such as glomerulonephritis and nephrotic syndrome, and a wide range of neurological symptoms have also been observed. The female worms release sheathed microfilariae detectable in the peripheral blood during daytime. Laboratory diagnosis relies on detecting microfilariae in a thick blood film or filtered blood, or using PCR (polymerase chain reaction) in amicrofilaraemic patients. Serology is not reliable due to cross-reactions with antibodies against other nematodes. Treatment with diethylcarbamazine (DEC), ivermectin, and albendazole may have severe side effects in patients with high levels of microfilariae, so sequential treatment is suggested based on the degree of microfilaraemia.\\nThis patient presents with an acute febrile illness that produces liver failure characterized by fever, jaundice, bleeding, encephalopathy, and seizures.

It primarily occurs in the rainforests of South America and the Caribbean. The clinical presentation of Mayaro infection is a dengue-like, febrile illness lasting 3-7 days, characterized by chills, headache, myalgia, arthralgia, nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, and a maculopapular rash. The disease may also cause debilitating and long-lasting polyarthralgias, which are suspected to arise from the inflammatory immune response stimulated by the prolonged virus persistence in joint tissues. The differential diagnosis includes reactive arthritis and viral arthritis, while the key finding to diagnose Mayaro virus infection is the detection of specific IgM and IgG antibodies against the virus using indirect immunofluorescence assay (IFA) and plaque reduction neutralization test (PRNT).\\n\\nEbola virus disease primarily occurs in tropical rainforests in sub-Saharan Africa and typically presents with fever, headache, asthenia, myalgias, abdominal pain, nausea, vomiting, and diarrhoea, with conjunctival injection and subconjunctival haemorrhage. Clinical presentation can include non-specific symptoms and rapidly progress to haemorrhage, multiple organ dysfunction, and shock. Important differential diagnoses include malaria, typhoid fever, bacterial gastroenteritis, and leptospirosis. The diagnosis is confirmed by detection of Ebola virus using ELISA antigen and PCR tests from blood or other body fluids, supported by relevant epidemiological exposure. The disease is caused by exposure to infected bat excreta or saliva, non-human primates, or person-to-person transmission in settings of inadequate universal precautions. Treatment is supportive, with antimalarials and broad-spectrum antibiotics given until the diagnosis of viral HF is confirmed.\\nThe patient presents with a severe febrile illness, characterized by fever, sore throat, general body ache, retrosternal chest pain, abdominal symptoms, and conjunctivitis.

Severe malaria is a life-threatening infection in non-immune patients and should be on the list of differential diagnoses for any unwell patient from the tropics. Early diagnosis and effective antimalarial drugs are key to malaria management.\\n\\nLeptospirosis is a zoonotic disease caused by pathogenic Leptospira species. The disease presents with a biphasic illness, initially non-specific symptoms such as fever, headache, and myalgias, followed by a second phase dominated by immune-mediated pathology. Classical presentation includes severe myalgias, subconjunctival hemorrhage, and jaundice. In severe cases, complications such as acute kidney injury, pulmonary involvement, and myocarditis may occur. Diagnosis is confirmed by PCR detection, MAT serology, or culture, and treatment involves antibiotics such as doxycycline, amoxicillin, or benzylpenicillin.\\nPaucibacillary leprosy primarily occurs in leprosy-endemic countries and typically presents with one or a few hypopigmented anaesthetic skin patches and thickened peripheral nerves. It is essential to consider the combination of a skin problem and signs of a neuropathy as a suspect for leprosy. Important differential diagnoses include various inflammatory or traumatic processes. Leprosy is diagnosed clinically, and the diagnosis is confirmed by skin biopsy and slit-skin smear. The diagnosis is also supported by the WHO categorization of leprosy according to the number of skin lesions, with paucibacillary leprosy being treated with rifampicin and dapsone once per month.\\nThe patient is a 55-year-old woman from Vietnam who presents with fever, headache, vomiting, confusion, and impaired consciousness. She has a petechial rash and purpuric non-blanching lesions on her trunk and leg. The patient has a history of type 2 diabetes and hypertension. The diagnosis is confirmed by lumbar puncture showing turbid cerebrospinal fluid with high neutrophil count, high protein, and low CSF glucose ratio. Blood cultures grow Streptococcus suis, sensitive to penicillin and ceftriaxone. The patient receives 12 days of antibiotic therapy and steroids, and responds to treatment but has residual bilateral hearing impairment.

It presents with coma, no neurological localizing signs, hepatosplenomegaly, and a positive malaria rapid diagnostic test. Key findings for diagnosis include retinal whitening, hemorrhages, or orange-white vessels with or without papilloedema on ophthalmoscopy. Important differential diagnoses include bacterial meningitis, viral encephalitis, intoxication, metabolic abnormalities, and non-convulsive status epilepticus. The diagnosis is confirmed by the presence of Plasmodium falciparum parasitemia and the absence of other causes of coma, with supportive findings of malarial retinopathy on ophthalmoscopy. The mainstay of therapy is antimalarials, intensive supportive care, and diagnosis and treatment of non-malarial contributors to illness.\\nKnowlesi malaria primarily presents with fever, thrombocytopenia, and non-specific arthralgias, and is characterized by a quotidian (daily) fever pattern with relatively high parasitaemias. The differential diagnosis includes dengue fever, chikungunya, Zika, influenza, acute HIV infection, enteric fever, and non-falciparum malaria, especially given the negative rapid diagnostic test for malaria. Diagnosis is confirmed by microscopy or PCR-based methods that distinguish *P. knowlesi* from other *Plasmodium species*, and treatment is the same as for acute falciparum malaria.\\nA 32-year-old woman from Nigeria presents with fever, jaundice, and confusion 18 days after returning from a visit to rural Nigeria. The most common cause of fever and jaundice in West Africa is severe falciparum malaria. A malaria blood film is crucial to confirm the diagnosis, and the patient should be treated as malaria and other tests taken with standard universal precautions. Severe malaria is a life-threatening infection in non-immune patients and should be on the list of differential diagnoses for any unwell patient from the tropics. Early diagnosis and effective antimalarial drugs are key to malaria management.\\n\\nInvasive non-typhoidal Salmonellae (iNTS) infection primarily presents with non-specific febrile illness, abdominal pain or history of diarrhea, mild splenomegaly, and severe anaemia. Clinically, it is characterized by aseptic fever, weight loss, and progressive weakness, with some patients reporting abdominal pain or history of diarrhea. Important differential diagnoses include typhoid and paratyphoid, malaria, and tuberculosis. The diagnosis is confirmed by detection of Salmonella enterica var Typhimurium in blood cultures, supported by relevant clinical presentation and epidemiological context. Severe anaemia is common and should prompt the clinician to look carefully for signs of TB co-infection.\\nBrucellosis is a zoonotic bacterial infection common in highly endemic countries like Afghanistan, presenting as a prolonged febrile illness, non-focal, with night sweats, fatigue, lymphadenopathy, and hepatosplenomegaly, and localized infection may affect various systems. Spondylitis, like in this case, is an osteoarticular complication occurring in up to 40% of cases and requires a prolonged treatment course of at least 12 weeks to avoid relapse. Diagnosis is challenging due to seroconversion in areas of high endemicity but tissue culture remains the gold standard for localized infection. Key findings for diagnosis include Brucella culture from blood or tissue samples, MRI showing spondylodiscitis with involvement of the psoas muscle, and raised CRP and ESR levels.\\nEnteric fever, caused by Salmonella Typhi, is clinically indistinguishable from paratyphoid fever caused by Salmonella Paratyphi A, B, and C. It typically presents with nonspecific symptoms such as fever, headache, dry cough, and abdominal pain. The fever starts insidiously and may be afebrile in the morning, with constipation being common and foul-smelling diarrhea occurring in the course of an untreated infection. The diagnosis is confirmed by proof of S. Typhi in blood cultures or bone marrow, while stool or urine isolation indicates a carrier state. Empirical antibiotic therapy should be started promptly, with fluoroquinolones being the drugs of choice in areas without antimicrobial resistance. The case fatality rate on antibiotic treatment is less than 1%, and targeted vaccination of high-risk populations seems to be a promising strategy to control the disease. Important differential diagnoses include malaria and invasive nontyphoidal salmonellae (iNTS) infections in HIV-positive patients. The diagnosis and treatment of enteric fever are crucial in areas where the disease is endemic due to high morbidity and mortality rates.\\n\\nAcute bacterial meningitis primarily occurs in individuals with immunocompromised status, such as HIV-positive patients, and presents with symptoms like high fever, rapid decline in consciousness, seizures, stiff neck, and altered mental status. Clinically, it is characterized by cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) analysis showing pleocytosis, increased protein, and decreased glucose. A lumbar puncture is necessary to obtain a diagnosis, and antibiotics should be administered as soon as possible. Important differential diagnoses include tuberculous meningitis, cryptococcal meningitis, and other bacterial causes like Streptococcus pneumoniae and Neisseria meningitidis.\\nTuberculous meningitis primarily occurs in settings with high tuberculosis prevalence and is characterized by florid gelatinous exudate in the subarachnoid space, causing symptoms such as fever, headache, cranial nerve palsies, and altered consciousness. Clinically, it presents as a subacute illness with systemic symptoms such as weight loss, night sweats, and cough. Key CSF findings include clear appearance, lymphocytic predominance, high protein concentration, and low CSF to plasma-glucose ratio. Important differential diagnoses include bacterial, cryptococcal, and other forms of meningitis. Diagnosis is confirmed by detection of acid-fast bacilli in CSF, culture, or molecular methods such as PCR. Treatment involves isoniazid, rifampicin, ethambutol, and pyrazinamide, with corticosteroids to improve clinical outcomes.\\nCryptococcal meningitis primarily occurs in sub-Saharan Africa and parts of Asia where HIV prevalence is high. It typically presents with sub-acute headache, cranial nerve palsies, confusion, and impaired consciousness. Clinically, it is characterized by raised intracranial pressure and non-specific cerebrospinal fluid findings. Important differential diagnoses include tuberculous meningitis and partially treated bacterial meningitis. The diagnosis is confirmed by demonstrating the fungus in the cerebrospinal fluid using methods such as India Ink staining, cryptococcal antigen detection, or fungal culture. Treatment consists of three phases: induction, consolidation, and maintenance, using drugs such as amphotericin B, flucytosine, and fluconazole. In resource-limited settings, alternative treatment regimens may be used due to poor drug availability.\\n\\nNeurocysticercosis presents with symptoms of focal epileptic seizures, with most common presentation being symptoms of 'pins and needles' sensation in a part of the body. It's caused by neurocysticercosis caused by the pork tapeworm Taenia solium, acquired after consuming food contaminated with T. solium eggs, which release oncospheres that infect the brain and form encysted larvae. Key findings to diagnose include neuroimaging showing multiple cystic lesions, supported by clinical presentation of focal seizures. Differential diagnoses in the context include hydrocephalus, cerebral oedema, and meningitis. The diagnosis is confirmed by serological and epidemiological evidence. Treatment includes antiparasitic drugs like albendazole or a combination of albendazole and praziquantel, in addition to steroid therapy.\\nThe disease primarily affects individuals born and living in areas with poor sanitation services and uncorralled pigs, such as rural Guatemala. It typically presents with transitory ischemic attacks, manifesting as parenchymal calcified lesions, complex cystic structures in the subarachnoid space, and an old lacunar infarct. Subarachnoid neurocysticercosis, the most severe form, is probably caused by the host's inflammatory response, manifesting as meningitis, communicating hydrocephalus, focal neurological symptoms, and cerebrovascular disease. Important differential diagnoses include other forms of neurocysticercosis, such as parenchymal neurocysticercosis, and other diseases causing similar imaging findings. The diagnosis is confirmed by MRI and serology, specifically the immunoblot with a sensitivity of 98% and specificity of near 100%, showing a high burden of disease. Treatment involves dual therapy with albendazole and praziquantel, corticosteroids, and a careful taper to avoid complications. The duration of treatment is still controversial, but current guidelines recommend treating until resolution on neuroimaging.\\nTuberculous meningitis primarily occurs in settings with high tuberculosis prevalence and is characterized by florid gelatinous exudate in the subarachnoid space, causing symptoms such as fever, headache, cranial nerve palsies, and altered consciousness.

It presents with urticaria and transient painless subcutaneous swellings (\\'Calabar swellings\\'), a localized angioedema which may last from several hours to a few days. Adult worms may be spotted when migrating through the bulbar conjunctiva, causing intense itching, pain, and photophobia. Renal complications, such as glomerulonephritis and nephrotic syndrome, and a wide range of neurological symptoms have also been observed. The female worms release sheathed microfilariae detectable in the peripheral blood during daytime. Laboratory diagnosis relies on detecting microfilariae in a thick blood film or filtered blood, or using PCR (polymerase chain reaction) in amicrofilaraemic patients. Serology is not reliable due to cross-reactions with antibodies against other nematodes. Treatment with diethylcarbamazine (DEC), ivermectin, and albendazole may have severe side effects in patients with high levels of microfilariae, so sequential treatment is suggested based on the degree of microfilaraemia.\\nFascioliasis, a serious public health problem, primarily affects people in the Andean countries, including Peru, caused by ingestion of metacercariae-contaminated watercress or drinking water. The disease includes four clinical phases and typically presents with intermittent fever, abdominal pain, malaise, weight loss, urticaria, and eosinophilia in the acute phase, while ova appear in the stool in the latent phase. Important differential diagnoses include pyogenic liver abscesses, amoebic liver abscess, brucellosis, visceral toxocariasis, and secondary infections. Diagnosis is confirmed by serological methods, such as the Fas2 ELISA, and treatment with triclabendazole is effective in almost 90% of cases.\\nSporotrichosis is a sub-acute to chronic fungal infection caused by Sporothrix schenckii. It typically presents with a slowly growing ulcer and multiple painless nodules on the lymphatic tract of the affected limb after minor trauma, usually by plant thorns or other cutting vegetation. In the chronic phase, it can progress and cause disseminated disease, particularly among immunosuppressed individuals and those with pre-existing chronic conditions. Important differential diagnoses include cutaneous leishmaniasis, Mycobacterium tuberculosis or M. marinum, Nocardiosis, and tularemia. The diagnosis can be challenging, and specimens are often required for microscopy, culture, or PCR for Leishmania, Mycobacterium, and Sporothrix species. The recommended treatment for cutaneous sporotrichosis is itraconazole 200 mg/day for 3-6 months or saturated solution of potassium iodide, and itraconazole (200mg PO bd) for 1–2 years for pulmonary and osteoarticular sporotrichosis.\\n\\nLoiasis, the symptomatic infection with the filarial nematode L. loa, primarily occurs in West and Central Africa.

The symptoms include fever, body aches, weakness, sore throat, retrosternal chest pain, abdominal pain, diarrhea, vomiting, cough, and breathlessness, with conjunctivitis often occurring late in the disease. The disease is more severe in pregnant women, and its severity is marked by raised liver transaminases. Clinically, it is characterized by a high case fatality rate in hospitalized patients, with a particularly high case fatality rate in the third trimester of pregnancy. The diagnosis is confirmed by antigen testing, PCR, or serological tests, with the treatment being with IV ribavirin, most effective when given early in the disease. Important differential diagnoses include adenovirus infections, measles, Mycoplasma pneumoniae, Leptospirosis, and typhoid fever.\\n\\nOnchocerciasis, also known as \"river blindness,\" primarily occurs in rural areas near rapidly flowing rivers, particularly in West and Central Africa.

The diagnosis is typically made based on clinical findings and supported by serological tests. The most important differential diagnoses to consider are other causes of skin changes and ocular changes such as scabies, yaws, leprosy, mycotic infections, and eczema. The key finding to diagnose onchocerciasis is the presence of subcutaneous nodules with microfilariae of Onchocerca volvulus, which can be detected by skin snips, slit-lamp examination, or nodulectomy. The diagnosis is confirmed by detection of antibodies to O. volvulus antigens through serological tests.

Key symptoms include intense itchy skin eruptions, usually on the feet or areas exposed to infested sand/soil. Diagnosis is made clinically and supported by travel history, and confirmed by the presence of pruritic papules and progressing erythematous tracks with variable speed, depending on the hookworm species. The diagnosis does not rely on skin biopsy, because the larva is always in advance of its track, and no reliable serological tests are available. Treatment of choice is ivermectin (200 μg/kg for 1-2 days), or albendazole 400mg twice daily for 3 days in case of ivermectin contraindication or unavailability.

Humans are exposed through infected animals or contaminated animal products. The disease presents as cutaneous (95% of cases), with a painless central ulcer, vesicles, and extensive surrounding edema. Systemic symptoms include malaise and headache, while fever and leukocytosis may not be present. Important differential diagnoses include bacterial ecthyma, rickettsial diseases, rat-bite fevers, necrotic arachnidism, ulceroglandular tularaemia, and bubonic plague. The diagnosis is confirmed by detection of *B. anthracis* in blood, skin lesion aspirate, or pleural fluid through Gram stain and culture or PCR and IHC staining. Empirical antibacterial treatment with a quinolone or doxycycline is initiated while awaiting microbiological results.\\n\\nMycobacterium ulcerans disease, commonly known as Buruli ulcer, primarily occurs in West Africa, mainly in children and adolescents, and presents with skin lesions ranging from papules, nodules, and plaques to ulcers. The lesions are typically painless but may be painful, and they can involve most of a limb surface or trunk, sometimes occurring at different body sites. Key findings for diagnosis include a history of living in an endemic area, particularly near water bodies such as rivers and lakes, and the presence of skin lesions showing skin alterations like induration, hypo- and hyperpigmentation, lichenification, desquamation, and possibly local edema. Important differential diagnoses include traumatic, infectious, and neoplastic causes of ulcers.

Clinical presentation includes painful, red, and watery eyes, accompanied by symptoms such as discharge, blurred vision, and lid scarring. The diagnosis is primarily based on clinical examination and signs, such as follicles on the tarsal conjunctiva, conjunctival scarring, limbal follicles or Herbert\\'s pits, fibrovascular pannus, and trichiasis. The WHO recommends the SAFE strategy for control: Surgery for advanced cases, Antibiotic treatment with azithromycin, Facial cleanliness, and Environmental improvement. The disease requires a comprehensive approach, including public health measures, to prevent and treat it effectively.\\nSporotrichosis is a sub-acute to chronic fungal infection caused by Sporothrix schenckii. It typically presents with a slowly growing ulcer and multiple painless nodules on the lymphatic tract of the affected limb after minor trauma, usually by plant thorns or other cutting vegetation. In the chronic phase, it can progress and cause disseminated disease, particularly among immunosuppressed individuals and those with pre-existing chronic conditions. Important differential diagnoses include cutaneous leishmaniasis, Mycobacterium tuberculosis or M. marinum, Nocardiosis, and tularemia. The diagnosis can be challenging, and specimens are often required for microscopy, culture, or PCR for Leishmania, Mycobacterium, and Sporothrix species. The recommended treatment for cutaneous sporotrichosis is itraconazole 200 mg/day for 3-6 months or saturated solution of potassium iodide, and itraconazole (200mg PO bd) for 1–2 years for pulmonary and osteoarticular sporotrichosis.\\nChromoblastomycosis is a chronic fungal infection of the skin and subcutaneous tissue, most commonly of hands, feet, and lower legs. It is typically caused by traumatic percutaneous inoculation of the genera Fonsecaea, Phialophora, and Cladophialophora.  The infection presents as painless lesions that develop slowly over years from the site of inoculation as verrucous nodules or plaques, gradually spreading centripetally by lymphatic or cutaneous dissemination. The disease is commonly found in rural tropical and subtropical areas and affects male agricultural workers. Important differential diagnoses include mycetoma, cutaneous tuberculosis, lepromatous leprosy, infections with atypical mycobacteria, cutaneous leishmaniasis, Kaposi\\'s Sarcoma, and non-infectious causes such as squamous cell carcinoma, sarcoidosis, chronic eczema, and psoriasis. The diagnosis is made by direct microscopic detection of pathognomonic sclerotic cells in skin scrapings, which are brownish, round, thick-walled structures of 4 to 12 µm length. Treatment is challenging and effectiveness depends on the causative agent, the clinical form, and the severity of the lesions.\\n\\nA 6-year-old boy from Malawi presented with a progressive painless proptosis of his left eye for 3 weeks, and his vision has not been impaired.

The diagnosis does not rely on skin biopsy, because the larva is always in advance of its track, and no reliable serological tests are available. Treatment of choice is ivermectin (200 μg/kg for 1-2 days), or albendazole 400mg twice daily for 3 days in case of ivermectin contraindication or unavailability. Differential diagnoses include infection with larvae of Strongyloides stercoralis (larva currens), Gnathostoma species, and Fasciola species, as well as migratory myiasis.\\nCrusted scabies primarily occurs in individuals with weakened immune systems, such as those with HIV, HTLV-1, immunosuppressive therapy, or certain medical conditions. It typically presents with a widespread, exfoliating rash, often involving the hands, feet, neck, face, scalp, axillae, trunk, buttocks, and limbs, often accompanied by secondary bacterial infections. Clinically, it is characterized by the presence of hyperkeratotic skin crusts, mites in skin lesions, and shedding of skin flakes onto bed linen and floors. Important differential diagnoses include psoriasis, tinea corporis, skin malignancies, nutritional deficiencies, onchocerciasis, lepromatous leprosy, and secondary syphilis. Diagnosis is confirmed by microscopy of skin scrapings under low-power magnification. The treatment typically involves topical scabicides, oral ivermectin, and keratolytic cream. Initial management includes oxygen therapy, fluid resuscitation, and antibiotic treatment for sepsis.\\nAnthrax is a zoonotic disease caused by *B. anthracis*, primarily affecting herbivores. Humans are exposed through infected animals or contaminated animal products. The disease presents as cutaneous (95% of cases), with a painless central ulcer, vesicles, and extensive surrounding edema. Systemic symptoms include malaise and headache, while fever and leukocytosis may not be present. Important differential diagnoses include bacterial ecthyma, rickettsial diseases, rat-bite fevers, necrotic arachnidism, ulceroglandular tularaemia, and bubonic plague. The diagnosis is confirmed by detection of *B. anthracis* in blood, skin lesion aspirate, or pleural fluid through Gram stain and culture or PCR and IHC staining.

In 2013, adalimumab (one injection/15 days) plus methotrexate (10mg/week) was used due to poor progress. Since then, she has not required steroids and has remained asymptomatic with this therapeutic approach. She recently presented a mucocutaneous, erythematous and ulcerous lesion in the nasal vestibule and the upper lip that has deformed her nose (Fig. 1). For this reason, she was referred to the ENT department, where a biopsy was performed and the subsequent anatomopathological study was diagnostic of leishmaniasis, both by direct vision with the Giemsa technique and by nested polymerase chain reaction.

Differential diagnoses include sporotrichosis, cutaneous tuberculosis, and infection by Balamuthia mandrillaris.

The clinical presentation includes chronic fever, fatigue, anorexia, weight loss, enlarged lymph nodes, splenomegaly, and hepatomegaly. It typically presents in 2-8 months after the sandfly bite. Laboratory results show pancytopenia, with depletion of all three cell lines in the FBC. A direct proof of the parasite is the classic confirmatory test for VL, but in low-resource settings, serological tests are often used instead, such as the rK39 immuno-chromatographic test (ICT), the Direct Agglutination Test (DAT), and semiquantitative DAT.

It presents with urticaria and transient painless subcutaneous swellings ('Calabar swellings'), a localized angioedema which may last from several hours to a few days. Adult worms may be spotted when migrating through the bulbar conjunctiva, causing intense itching, pain, and photophobia. Renal complications, such as glomerulonephritis and nephrotic syndrome, and a wide range of neurological symptoms have also been observed. The female worms release sheathed microfilariae detectable in the peripheral blood during daytime. Laboratory diagnosis relies on detecting microfilariae in a thick blood film or filtered blood, or using PCR (polymerase chain reaction) in amicrofilaraemic patients. Serology is not reliable due to cross-reactions with antibodies against other nematodes. Treatment with diethylcarbamazine (DEC), ivermectin, and albendazole may have severe side effects in patients with high levels of microfilariae, so sequential treatment is suggested based on the degree of microfilaraemia.\\n\\nCutaneous leishmaniasis typically occurs in areas where sand flies are present, such as the Andes in Peru.

The symptoms started 6-8 weeks after her return from a family visit to northern Thailand. On examination, multiple cutaneous and subcutaneous abscesses and a generalized lymphadenopathy are noted. Laboratory findings show elevated systemic markers of inflammation. The clinical picture and laboratory findings are highly suspicious of a systemic infection, and differential diagnoses include histoplasmosis, mycobacterial infections (such as melioidosis), and autoimmune syndromes. Key findings to diagnose Histoplasmosis include fungal cells identified on histopathology of a lymph node biopsy, and the presence of Histoplasma capsulatum confirmed by PCR and culture.\\n\\nThe disease in question is Mayaro virus infection, a tropical and vector-borne viral disease. It primarily occurs in the rainforests of South America and the Caribbean. The clinical presentation of Mayaro infection is a dengue-like, febrile illness lasting 3-7 days, characterized by chills, headache, myalgia, arthralgia, nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, and a maculopapular rash. The disease may also cause debilitating and long-lasting polyarthralgias, which are suspected to arise from the inflammatory immune response stimulated by the prolonged virus persistence in joint tissues. The differential diagnosis includes reactive arthritis and viral arthritis, while the key finding to diagnose Mayaro virus infection is the detection of specific IgM and IgG antibodies against the virus using indirect immunofluorescence assay (IFA) and plaque reduction neutralization test (PRNT).\\nRabies is a viral infection caused by the Lyssavirus genus, transmitted through the bite of infected mammals, with an incubation period of 20-90 days. The paralytic form of rabies initially presents with fever, paraesthesia in the bitten limb, followed by rapid progression to quadriparesis, particularly proximal muscle involvement. Clinically, it may mimic Guillain Barre syndrome, post-vaccination encephalomyelitis, and other conditions. Laboratory confirmation involves testing for rabies-specific antibodies in saliva, CSF, or serum, and detection of viral RNA by RT-PCR from saliva or nuchal skin biopsy. Important differential diagnoses include Guillain Barre syndrome, post-vaccination encephalomyelitis, and other conditions listed in Table 91.1. The diagnosis is confirmed by detection of rabies-specific antibodies in CSF and serum, or by antigen detection using direct fluorescent antibody (dFA) test or RT-PCR on brain tissue obtained post-mortem.\\nAnthrax is a zoonotic disease caused by *B. anthracis*, primarily affecting herbivores.

The patient worked as a mechanic, had no pets, no recent travel history and no unusual contacts or hobbies. In the preceding 4 weeks and prior to his deterioration, he had presented on two separate occasions to a hospital emergency department – once to hospital A and once to hospital B, a different hospital in the city. At the first visit, which was to hospital A, the patient reported a mild headache, which responded to analgesia with no red flag symptoms. Blood tests were taken, including a routine opt-out bloodborne viral (BBV) screen. The patient was discharged from the ED. The BBV screen was subsequently reported as reactive for HIV antigen and antibody. Multiple unsuccessful attempts were made by staff to contact the patient by telephone and post. Two weeks later, the patient was brought back to the emergency department of hospital A. He presented with reduced consciousness. The patient’s housemates, who accompanied him to the hospital, reported worsening drowsiness over the preceding days. On initial examination, Glasgow Coma Scale (GCS) was 12/15, with unequal pupils. His temperature was 40.0°C and his heart rate was 120 beats per minute. Initial oxygen saturation was 99% in room air. One hour after presentation, GCS deteriorated from 12 to 6.

Pneumocystis pneumonia (PCP) is a high differential diagnosis. Serum 1,3 β-D-glucan is frequently elevated in patients with PCP, but it lacks specificity. Bronchoscopy and immunofluorescence or Grocott methenamine silver staining of bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL) specimens are the diagnostic tests of choice. Diagnosis of PCP is confirmed by visualizing P. jirovecii on BAL fluid (>90% sensitivity), with induced sputum having lower sensitivity. First-line treatment is with co-trimoxazole, in severe cases intravenous, with the addition of high-dose corticosteroids in moderate to severe PCP improving outcomes. Adverse effects with co-trimoxazole are common and usually occur at 6 to 14 days of treatment.\\nA 51-year-old female traveller returning from Central America presents with a generalized slightly pruritic maculopapular rash, conjunctivitis, peripheral painful oedema, and generalized lymphadenopathy.

This was followed by a two-week course of trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole (TMP-SMX) and cefazolin, resulting in complete resolution of symptoms related to coexisting Nocardia spp., methicillin-susceptible Staphylococcus aureus (MSSA), and Streptococcus agalactiae group B infections as confirmed by blood and tissue cultures at that time. The physical exam during his current presentation revealed marked edema of the distal right lower extremity, multiple granulomatous foci, and two well-healed scars along the medial and lateral aspects of the calf, attributable to his previous surgical debridement from 2018 (Figure 1). He had full strength and sensation in the affected extremity without any discernible deficits. There were no signs indicative of a systemic infection, and the patient’s vital signs remained stable. A computed tomography (CT) scan was completed, showing superficial compartment edema of the posterior distal lower extremity, along with an irregular heterogenous collection in the posteriomedial calf (Figure 2). Given the uncertainty regarding deep compartment involvement and the high suspicion of a developing abscess due to a recurrent Nocardia spp. infection, the patient was subsequently taken to the operating room. The final surgical pathology from the biopsied lesions and muscle indicated small clusters of thin filiform bacteria, which stained positively for Gram and Ziehl-Neelsen, most consistent with an actinomycetoma.',\n",

              "  'ground_truth': 'The patient presented with a chronic, progressive soft-tissue infection of the lower extremity characterized by swelling, indurated granulomatous lesions, and a history of recurrence. His occupation as a landscaper suggests repeated traumatic inoculation from soil, a classic risk factor for mycetoma. Imaging showed localized soft-tissue involvement, and definitive diagnosis was established by histopathology demonstrating thin, filamentous Gram- and Ziehl–Neelsen–positive bacteria, consistent with actinomycetoma.',\n",
              "  'answer': \"The patient's symptoms and medical history, including the presence of multiple raised and indurated lesions at various stages of healing, a similar episode in 2018, and the identification of small clusters of thin filiform bacteria that stained positively for Gram and Ziehl-Neelsen, are most consistent with **Actinomycetoma** and **Mycetoma**. However, the key findings from the surgical pathology, including the description of the bacteria, strongly support **Actinomycetoma**. The presence of granulomatous foci and the patient's occupation as a landscaper, which may involve exposure to soil and organic matter, further support this diagnosis. \\n\\nThe images provided show a close-up of the patient's leg with multiple lesions and a surgical site with a large wound, which are consistent with the diagnosis of Actinomycetoma, a type of mycetoma caused by bacteria of the order Actinomycetales. \\n\\nCellulitis and Streptococcus agalactiae infection are less likely given the chronic nature of the lesions and the specific microbiological findings. Nocardia infection is a consideration given the patient's history, but the final pathology results point more towards Actinomycetoma. \\n\\nTherefore, the final diagnoses are **Actinomycetoma** and **Mycetoma**.\",\n",

Key symptoms include intense itchy skin eruptions, usually on the feet or areas exposed to infested sand/soil. Diagnosis is made clinically and supported by travel history, and confirmed by the presence of pruritic papules and progressing erythematous tracks with variable speed, depending on the hookworm species. The diagnosis does not rely on skin biopsy, because the larva is always in advance of its track, and no reliable serological tests are available. Treatment of choice is ivermectin (200 μg/kg for 1-2 days), or albendazole 400mg twice daily for 3 days in case of ivermectin contraindication or unavailability. Differential diagnoses include infection with larvae of Strongyloides stercoralis (larva currens), Gnathostoma species, and Fasciola species, as well as migratory myiasis.\\nChromoblastomycosis is a chronic fungal infection of the skin and subcutaneous tissue, most commonly of hands, feet, and lower legs. It is typically caused by traumatic percutaneous inoculation of the genera Fonsecaea, Phialophora, and Cladophialophora.  The infection presents as painless lesions that develop slowly over years from the site of inoculation as verrucous nodules or plaques, gradually spreading centripetally by lymphatic or cutaneous dissemination. The disease is commonly found in rural tropical and subtropical areas and affects male agricultural workers. Important differential diagnoses include mycetoma, cutaneous tuberculosis, lepromatous leprosy, infections with atypical mycobacteria, cutaneous leishmaniasis, Kaposi's Sarcoma, and non-infectious causes such as squamous cell carcinoma, sarcoidosis, chronic eczema, and psoriasis. The diagnosis is made by direct microscopic detection of pathognomonic sclerotic cells in skin scrapings, which are brownish, round, thick-walled structures of 4 to 12 µm length. Treatment is challenging and effectiveness depends on the causative agent, the clinical form, and the severity of the lesions.\\nTalaromycosis (penicilliosis) is a fungal infection that typically affects severely immunocompromised individuals, often those with HIV/AIDS. It presents with non-specific symptoms such as prolonged fever, fatigue, weight loss, and diarrhea, accompanied by clinical signs of lymphadenopathy, hepatosplenomegaly, and anemia. Generalized umbilicated papular skin lesions, often located on the face, chest, and extremities, are characteristic. Important differential diagnoses include cryptococcosis, histoplasmosis, talaromycosis, disseminated tuberculosis, and infections with atypical mycobacteria. Diagnosis is confirmed by identification of the fungus in clinical specimens, including blood, bronchoalveolar lavage fluid, or biopsies of skin, lymph nodes, or bone marrow, showing extracellular and intracellular yeasts with a transverse septum. Key diagnostic findings include a CD4 count below 100 cells/µL, and treatment is with intravenous amphotericin B followed by oral itraconazole, with secondary prophylaxis in HIV-infected patients.\\n\\nNoma is primarily encountered in the poorest children in developing countries, often with compromised immunity from malnutrition and vitamin deficiencies. Its symptoms begin with a sore on the face and bad breath, quickly advancing to a gangrenous lesion that can destroy tissue, with cases reported having a high case fatality rate of 70-90%. The diagnosis is primarily clinical, with other diseases such as malaria, measles, and oral cancer being unlikely causes. A confirmed diagnosis is not feasible with any diagnostic lab tests, hence it is crucial for a health worker to recognize noma based on symptoms and take action as it is treatable with antibiotics, nutritional support, and surgery. Other complications from the disease should also be looked for and treated in conjunction with the ongoing care.\\nPericardial tamponade caused by tuberculosis is a common condition in Africa, characterized by symptoms of right heart failure and cardiac decompensation. Clinically, it presents with signs such as tachycardia, pulsus paradoxus, hypotension, impalpable apex beat, raised jugular venous pressure, and quiet heart sounds. The diagnosis is suspected based on clinical presentation and further confirmed by ultrasound of the heart showing pericardial fluid, often blood-stained. The most common cause in Africa is tuberculosis, frequently associated with HIV infection, requiring prompt antituberculous treatment with corticosteroids. The diagnosis and management also involve HIV testing, antiretroviral therapy, and timely initiation of antituberculous treatment. Key findings to diagnose this disease include ultrasonography showing pericardial effusion, preferably confirmed by Xpert MTB/RIF assay. The most important differential diagnosis is other conditions causing pericardial effusion, such as bacterial infections, malignancy, and heart failure. The diagnosis is confirmed by laboratory evaluation, including ultrasonography and, if available, Xpert MTB/RIF assay, which can provide a confirmed diagnosis of TB within 2 hours.\\nInvasive non-typhoidal Salmonellae (iNTS) infection primarily presents with non-specific febrile illness, abdominal pain or history of diarrhea, mild splenomegaly, and severe anaemia. Clinically, it is characterized by aseptic fever, weight loss, and progressive weakness, with some patients reporting abdominal pain or history of diarrhea. Important differential diagnoses include typhoid and paratyphoid, malaria, and tuberculosis. The diagnosis is confirmed by detection of Salmonella enterica var Typhimurium in blood cultures, supported by relevant clinical presentation and epidemiological context. Severe anaemia is common and should prompt the clinician to look carefully for signs of TB co-infection.\\n\\nChromoblastomycosis is a chronic fungal infection of the skin and subcutaneous tissue, most commonly of hands, feet, and lower legs. It is typically caused by traumatic percutaneous inoculation of the genera Fonsecaea, Phialophora, and Cladophialophora.

She has a petechial rash and purpuric non-blanching lesions on her trunk and leg. The patient has a history of type 2 diabetes and hypertension. The diagnosis is confirmed by lumbar puncture showing turbid cerebrospinal fluid with high neutrophil count, high protein, and low CSF glucose ratio. Blood cultures grow Streptococcus suis, sensitive to penicillin and ceftriaxone. The patient receives 12 days of antibiotic therapy and steroids, and responds to treatment but has residual bilateral hearing impairment. Key findings to diagnose this exact disease include CSF analysis, blood cultures, and Gram stain. Differential diagnoses include malaria, enteric fever, dengue fever, and melioidosis.\\nBartonellosis, caused by B. bacilliformis, is a vector-borne disease mainly found in the Andean valleys of Peru, transmitted by female sandflies. The disease is characterized by a severe haemolytic anaemia with jaundice, high fever, malaise, myalgias, and CNS involvement. It progresses to a chronic angioproliferative cutaneous stage ('verruga peruana') in approximately 5% of treated patients and an unknown percentage of untreated individuals. Diagnosis is made by proof of cocco-bacilli inside red blood cells, while treatment of the acute phase includes ciprofloxacin alone or combined with ceftriaxone in severe cases. The differential diagnoses include malaria and bartonellosis, as well as several non-infectious causes of haemolysis.\\nFascioliasis, a serious public health problem, primarily affects people in the Andean countries, including Peru, caused by ingestion of metacercariae-contaminated watercress or drinking water. The disease includes four clinical phases and typically presents with intermittent fever, abdominal pain, malaise, weight loss, urticaria, and eosinophilia in the acute phase, while ova appear in the stool in the latent phase. Important differential diagnoses include pyogenic liver abscesses, amoebic liver abscess, brucellosis, visceral toxocariasis, and secondary infections. Diagnosis is confirmed by serological methods, such as the Fas2 ELISA, and treatment with triclabendazole is effective in almost 90% of cases.\\n\\nMycobacterium ulcerans disease, commonly known as Buruli ulcer, primarily occurs in West Africa, mainly in children and adolescents, and presents with skin lesions ranging from papules, nodules, and plaques to ulcers. The lesions are typically painless but may be painful, and they can involve most of a limb surface or trunk, sometimes occurring at different body sites. Key findings for diagnosis include a history of living in an endemic area, particularly near water bodies such as rivers and lakes, and the presence of skin lesions showing skin alterations like induration, hypo- and hyperpigmentation, lichenification, desquamation, and possibly local edema. Important differential diagnoses include traumatic, infectious, and neoplastic causes of ulcers. The diagnosis is confirmed by PCR from a wound swab, and treatment involves combination therapy with rifampicin, streptomycin, or clarithromycin for eight weeks, along with local heat application, wound care, pain relief, surgical excision, and skin grafting, as well as physiotherapy for restricted movements.\\nThe patient is a 55-year-old woman from Vietnam who presents with fever, headache, vomiting, confusion, and impaired consciousness. She has a petechial rash and purpuric non-blanching lesions on her trunk and leg. The patient has a history of type 2 diabetes and hypertension.

Key findings to diagnose this exact disease include CSF analysis, blood cultures, and Gram stain. Differential diagnoses include malaria, enteric fever, dengue fever, and melioidosis.\\nA boil on the leg, which developed slowly over 3 weeks, is itchy but not painful. The primary differential diagnoses include cutaneous myiasis, which is the infestation of live humans with larvae (maggots) of flies that feed on the host's dead or living tissue. Myiasis, typically caused by the larvae of Cordylobia anthropophaga in sub-Saharan Africa, presents as an itchy and sometimes painful 'blind boil' that can become sterile due to bacteriostatic substances produced by the larvae. The disease is usually contracted when a person lies on the ground or wears contaminated clothes without prior hot ironing. The diagnosis was confirmed by the presence of the maggot of a Tumbu fly. The key finding for diagnosis is the whitish matter with a pulsating and oozing transparent fluid, visible upon removal of the scab.\\n\\n\"},\n",

He had a past medical history of uncontrolled diabetes mellitus, hypertension, bronchial asthma, and chronic otitis media. He required an automastoidectomy for the chronic otitis media, complicated by a tegmen tympani defect and secondary pseudomeningocele formation communicating with the left temporal horn He had bacterial meningitis 6\\u2009years ago, complicated by hydrocephalus that required a temporary external ventricular shunt placement. The patient was initially managed as a case of upper respiratory tract infection and discharged on the same day with a course of oral antibiotics. He returned to the emergency room 1 day later because of worsening headache and vomiting associated with altered sensorium. The patient was well built but sick‐looking. His systolic blood pressure was 160/75\\u2009mm Hg, heart rate 110 beats/min, respiratory rate 27/min, the temperature 38°C, and oxygen saturation 96% at room air. His initial neurological examination revealed no eye‐opening to pain, and he produced sounds only as a verbal response. His pupils' size was 4\\u2009mm and reactive to light, and he blinked to a threat in both eyes. With the fundus examination, there was bilateral papilledema. He had a normal vestibulo‐ocular reflex, positive corneal reflex, no facial asymmetry, the gag reflex was preserved, and in response to painful stimulus on the sternum, he showed withdrawal response bilaterally. He had nuchal rigidity with positive Brudzinski and Kernig signs. His arterial blood gas results showed a pH of 7.512, pCO2 of 30.8\\u2009mmHg, pO2 of 80.2\\u2009mmHg, and an HCO3 of 24.1\\u2009nmol/L. The laboratory results were significant with the WBC count of 13,000 cells/μL, the lactic acid was 2.49\\u2009mmol/L (0.5–2.2\\u2009mmol/L), and the potassium was 2.7\\u2009mmol/L (3.6–5.2\\u2009mmol/L).* The other laboratory parameters including hemoglobin, platelets, renal function, liver function, coagulation profile and cardiac enzymes were within normal limits. Initial brain computerized tomography (CT) scan showed no significant abnormality. Following the brain CT, a lumbar puncture was performed. The appearance of the CSF was a thick yellow liquid resembling pus (Figure 2). The CSF WBC count was 158,000 cells/μL (0–5 cells/μL), the CSF protein 18.67\\u2009mg/mL (0.15 to 0.6\\u2009mg/mL), the CSF lactic acid 42.37\\u2009mmol/L (0–3\\u2009mmol/L), the CSF glucose 0.1\\u2009mg/100\\u2009mL (50–80\\u2009mg/100\\u2009mL), the CSF RBCs were less than 1 RBC/mm3 (<1 RBC/mm3), and the CSF culture indicated S. pneumoniae (see endnote 1).

Clinically, it presents as a subacute illness with systemic symptoms such as weight loss, night sweats, and cough. Key CSF findings include clear appearance, lymphocytic predominance, high protein concentration, and low CSF to plasma-glucose ratio. Important differential diagnoses include bacterial, cryptococcal, and other forms of meningitis. Diagnosis is confirmed by detection of acid-fast bacilli in CSF, culture, or molecular methods such as PCR. Treatment involves isoniazid, rifampicin, ethambutol, and pyrazinamide, with corticosteroids to improve clinical outcomes.\\nCryptococcal meningitis primarily occurs in sub-Saharan Africa and parts of Asia where HIV prevalence is high. It typically presents with sub-acute headache, cranial nerve palsies, confusion, and impaired consciousness. Clinically, it is characterized by raised intracranial pressure and non-specific cerebrospinal fluid findings. Important differential diagnoses include tuberculous meningitis and partially treated bacterial meningitis. The diagnosis is confirmed by demonstrating the fungus in the cerebrospinal fluid using methods such as India Ink staining, cryptococcal antigen detection, or fungal culture. Treatment consists of three phases: induction, consolidation, and maintenance, using drugs such as amphotericin B, flucytosine, and fluconazole. In resource-limited settings, alternative treatment regimens may be used due to poor drug availability.\\n\\nNeurocysticercosis presents with symptoms of focal epileptic seizures, with most common presentation being symptoms of 'pins and needles' sensation in a part of the body. It's caused by neurocysticercosis caused by the pork tapeworm Taenia solium, acquired after consuming food contaminated with T. solium eggs, which release oncospheres that infect the brain and form encysted larvae. Key findings to diagnose include neuroimaging showing multiple cystic lesions, supported by clinical presentation of focal seizures.

Treatment includes antiparasitic drugs like albendazole or a combination of albendazole and praziquantel, in addition to steroid therapy.\\nThe disease primarily affects individuals born and living in areas with poor sanitation services and uncorralled pigs, such as rural Guatemala. It typically presents with transitory ischemic attacks, manifesting as parenchymal calcified lesions, complex cystic structures in the subarachnoid space, and an old lacunar infarct. Subarachnoid neurocysticercosis, the most severe form, is probably caused by the host's inflammatory response, manifesting as meningitis, communicating hydrocephalus, focal neurological symptoms, and cerebrovascular disease. Important differential diagnoses include other forms of neurocysticercosis, such as parenchymal neurocysticercosis, and other diseases causing similar imaging findings. The diagnosis is confirmed by MRI and serology, specifically the immunoblot with a sensitivity of 98% and specificity of near 100%, showing a high burden of disease.

The duration of treatment is still controversial, but current guidelines recommend treating until resolution on neuroimaging.\\nRabies is a viral infection caused by the Lyssavirus genus, transmitted through the bite of infected mammals, with an incubation period of 20-90 days. The paralytic form of rabies initially presents with fever, paraesthesia in the bitten limb, followed by rapid progression to quadriparesis, particularly proximal muscle involvement. Clinically, it may mimic Guillain Barre syndrome, post-vaccination encephalomyelitis, and other conditions. Laboratory confirmation involves testing for rabies-specific antibodies in saliva, CSF, or serum, and detection of viral RNA by RT-PCR from saliva or nuchal skin biopsy. Important differential diagnoses include Guillain Barre syndrome, post-vaccination encephalomyelitis, and other conditions listed in Table 91.1.

It presents with coma, no neurological localizing signs, hepatosplenomegaly, and a positive malaria rapid diagnostic test. Key findings for diagnosis include retinal whitening, hemorrhages, or orange-white vessels with or without papilloedema on ophthalmoscopy. Important differential diagnoses include bacterial meningitis, viral encephalitis, intoxication, metabolic abnormalities, and non-convulsive status epilepticus. The diagnosis is confirmed by the presence of Plasmodium falciparum parasitemia and the absence of other causes of coma, with supportive findings of malarial retinopathy on ophthalmoscopy. The mainstay of therapy is antimalarials, intensive supportive care, and diagnosis and treatment of non-malarial contributors to illness.\\nTuberculous meningitis primarily occurs in settings with high tuberculosis prevalence and is characterized by florid gelatinous exudate in the subarachnoid space, causing symptoms such as fever, headache, cranial nerve palsies, and altered consciousness.

Key findings for diagnosis include retinal whitening, hemorrhages, or orange-white vessels with or without papilloedema on ophthalmoscopy. Important differential diagnoses include bacterial meningitis, viral encephalitis, intoxication, metabolic abnormalities, and non-convulsive status epilepticus. The diagnosis is confirmed by the presence of Plasmodium falciparum parasitemia and the absence of other causes of coma, with supportive findings of malarial retinopathy on ophthalmoscopy. The mainstay of therapy is antimalarials, intensive supportive care, and diagnosis and treatment of non-malarial contributors to illness.\\nCerebral sparganosis, a food-borne zoonosis, primarily occurs in Asian countries, particularly China, South Korea, Thailand, and Japan, and presents with symptoms suggestive of a space-occupying lesion, such as headache, confusion, seizures, paralysis, or palsies. Important differential diagnoses include brain tumours or metastases, neurocysticercosis, cerebral schistosomiasis, and paragonimiasis. Diagnosis is confirmed by dependant history taking and serological investigations, supplemented by neuroimaging, especially MRI, which often reveals the 'tunnel sign' with hypointensity in T1-weighted and hyperintensity in T2-weighted images. The most effective treatment is the removal of the sparganum from the brain. Praziquantel treatment may also be effective.\\nA 25-year-old HIV-positive Zambian woman presented with a new-onset seizure. There are focal cortical lesions on the right hemisphere without contrast enhancement restricted to the subcortical white matter, suggestive of progressive multifocal leukoencephalopathy (PML). Important differential diagnoses include tuberculoma, cerebral toxoplasmosis, cryptococcoma, brain abscess, and primary CNS lymphoma. Key findings that led to the diagnosis of PML include normal CSF examination apart from slightly raised protein levels, focal brain lesion as revealed by EEG and CT scan, and JC-virus DNA detection in the CSF. Confirmation of the diagnosis of PML was based on JC-virus DNA detection in the CSF. The patient was treated with antiretroviral therapy (ART) and carbamazepine for seizure management.\\n\\nAcute bacterial meningitis primarily occurs in individuals with immunocompromised status, such as HIV-positive patients, and presents with symptoms like high fever, rapid decline in consciousness, seizures, stiff neck, and altered mental status. Clinically, it is characterized by cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) analysis showing pleocytosis, increased protein, and decreased glucose. A lumbar puncture is necessary to obtain a diagnosis, and antibiotics should be administered as soon as possible. Important differential diagnoses include tuberculous meningitis, cryptococcal meningitis, and other bacterial causes like Streptococcus pneumoniae and Neisseria meningitidis.\\nCerebral sparganosis, a food-borne zoonosis, primarily occurs in Asian countries, particularly China, South Korea, Thailand, and Japan, and presents with symptoms suggestive of a space-occupying lesion, such as headache, confusion, seizures, paralysis, or palsies.

In April 2014, he and his team established an EVD care unit in Monrovia, and patients with confirmed EVD began arriving at this facility on June 11, 2014. On July 23, 2014, he awoke feeling febrile and fatigued; his oral temperature was 37.8°C. He reported his symptoms to colleagues and remained at home. Results on two rapid diagnostic tests for malaria (Standard Diagnostics) were negative. He started empirical malaria treatment with artemether and lumefantrine. Later that day, his oral temperature was 38.6°C, and nausea developed. He was tested for malaria by means of a rapid diagnostic test and for yellow fever, Lassa fever, and EBOV by means of semiquantitative real-time reverse-transcriptase–polymerase-chain-reaction (RT-PCR) assays, all of which were performed at the Liberian National Reference Laboratory. The results for all the tests were negative.The initial diagnose include these disease: Ebola, Lassa fever, Yellow fever, Malaria, Viral hemorrhagic fever. and its relevant information: Ebola virus disease primarily occurs in tropical rainforests in sub-Saharan Africa and typically presents with fever, headache, asthenia, myalgias, abdominal pain, nausea, vomiting, and diarrhoea, with conjunctival injection and subconjunctival haemorrhage. Clinical presentation can include non-specific symptoms and rapidly progress to haemorrhage, multiple organ dysfunction, and shock. Important differential diagnoses include malaria, typhoid fever, bacterial gastroenteritis, and leptospirosis. The diagnosis is confirmed by detection of Ebola virus using ELISA antigen and PCR tests from blood or other body fluids, supported by relevant epidemiological exposure. The disease is caused by exposure to infected bat excreta or saliva, non-human primates, or person-to-person transmission in settings of inadequate universal precautions. Treatment is supportive, with antimalarials and broad-spectrum antibiotics given until the diagnosis of viral HF is confirmed.\\nThe patient presents with a severe febrile illness, characterized by fever, sore throat, general body ache, retrosternal chest pain, abdominal symptoms, and conjunctivitis. Hypotension and shock are also present. Bilateral conjunctivitis and no rash or lymphadenopathy are notable findings. The patient's husband died of a similar illness recently, raising the suspicion of viral haemorrhagic fever, particularly Marburg virus disease or Ebola virus disease. Differential diagnoses include malaria, typhoid fever, bacterial sepsis, measles, Zika virus, and other viral infections. The diagnosis is confirmed by detection of Marburg virus RNA or Ebola virus RNA using PCR from blood or other body fluids, with a low parasitaemia of Plasmodium falciparum. Important findings include conjunctivitis, retrosternal chest pain, and abdominal symptoms, which are indicative of the viral haemorrhagic fever.\\nA 32-year-old woman from Nigeria presents with fever, jaundice, and confusion 18 days after returning from a visit to rural Nigeria. The most common cause of fever and jaundice in West Africa is severe falciparum malaria. A malaria blood film is crucial to confirm the diagnosis, and the patient should be treated as malaria and other tests taken with standard universal precautions. Severe malaria is a life-threatening infection in non-immune patients and should be on the list of differential diagnoses for any unwell patient from the tropics. Early diagnosis and effective antimalarial drugs are key to malaria management.\\n\\nLassa fever is common in sub-Saharan West Africa and is thought to infect approximately 300,000 people annually. The symptoms include fever, body aches, weakness, sore throat, retrosternal chest pain, abdominal pain, diarrhea, vomiting, cough, and breathlessness, with conjunctivitis often occurring late in the disease. The disease is more severe in pregnant women, and its severity is marked by raised liver transaminases. Clinically, it is characterized by a high case fatality rate in hospitalized patients, with a particularly high case fatality rate in the third trimester of pregnancy. The diagnosis is confirmed by antigen testing, PCR, or serological tests, with the treatment being with IV ribavirin, most effective when given early in the disease. Important differential diagnoses include adenovirus infections, measles, Mycoplasma pneumoniae, Leptospirosis, and typhoid fever.\\nLoiasis, the symptomatic infection with the filarial nematode L. loa, primarily occurs in West and Central Africa. It presents with urticaria and transient painless subcutaneous swellings ('Calabar swellings'), a localized angioedema which may last from several hours to a few days. Adult worms may be spotted when migrating through the bulbar conjunctiva, causing intense itching, pain, and photophobia. Renal complications, such as glomerulonephritis and nephrotic syndrome, and a wide range of neurological symptoms have also been observed. The female worms release sheathed microfilariae detectable in the peripheral blood during daytime. Laboratory diagnosis relies on detecting microfilariae in a thick blood film or filtered blood, or using PCR (polymerase chain reaction) in amicrofilaraemic patients. Serology is not reliable due to cross-reactions with antibodies against other nematodes. Treatment with diethylcarbamazine (DEC), ivermectin, and albendazole may have severe side effects in patients with high levels of microfilariae, so sequential treatment is suggested based on the degree of microfilaraemia.\\nThis patient presents with an acute febrile illness that produces liver failure characterized by fever, jaundice, bleeding, encephalopathy, and seizures. Key findings include elevated liver transaminases, jaundice, spontaneous bleeding, and low hematocrit. The differential diagnosis includes viral hepatitis, malaria, dengue fever, leptospirosis, and severe yellow fever. Important laboratory tests for diagnosis include serial thick blood smears, dengue NS1 and IgM, blood cultures, PCR for leptospirosis, and IgM antibodies for viral hepatitis. The patient eventually died of yellow fever, as confirmed by highly positive IgM capture ELISA.\\n\\nThis patient presents with an acute febrile illness that produces liver failure characterized by fever, jaundice, bleeding, encephalopathy, and seizures.

It presents with coma, no neurological localizing signs, hepatosplenomegaly, and a positive malaria rapid diagnostic test. Key findings for diagnosis include retinal whitening, hemorrhages, or orange-white vessels with or without papilloedema on ophthalmoscopy. Important differential diagnoses include bacterial meningitis, viral encephalitis, intoxication, metabolic abnormalities, and non-convulsive status epilepticus. The diagnosis is confirmed by the presence of Plasmodium falciparum parasitemia and the absence of other causes of coma, with supportive findings of malarial retinopathy on ophthalmoscopy. The mainstay of therapy is antimalarials, intensive supportive care, and diagnosis and treatment of non-malarial contributors to illness.\\nA 34-year-old HIV-positive woman from Malawi presented with slowly progressive half-sided weakness of the left arm and leg, localized to her brain. Focal brain lesions in HIV-infected individuals in tropical countries are broad, including HIV-related brain diseases such as cerebral toxoplasmosis, progressive multifocal leukoencephalopathy, CNS lymphoma, cryptococcoma, and CMV encephalitis. Cerebral TB, brain tumor, brain metastases, cerebral abscess, neurocysticercosis, neuroschistosomiasis, and Chagas' disease are also considered. The patient's clinical status worsened after ART initiation, consistent with immune reconstitution inflammatory syndrome (IRIS). A cerebral MRI showed multifocal T2 hyperintense lesions in the white matter, and a presumed diagnosis of PML was made. PML always occurs due to reactivation of the human JC polyomavirus, typically in immunosuppressed individuals, presenting with muscle weakness, sensory deficits, hemianopia, cognitive dysfunction, aphasia, and coordination and gait difficulties. Key findings to diagnose include a typical imaging pattern (hypodense on CT, hyperintense on T2-weighted MRI) without mass effect or contrast enhancement, and a history of immunosuppression\\nA 32-year-old woman from Nigeria presents with fever, jaundice, and confusion 18 days after returning from a visit to rural Nigeria. The most common cause of fever and jaundice in West Africa is severe falciparum malaria. A malaria blood film is crucial to confirm the diagnosis, and the patient should be treated as malaria and other tests taken with standard universal precautions. Severe malaria is a life-threatening infection in non-immune patients and should be on the list of differential diagnoses for any unwell patient from the tropics. Early diagnosis and effective antimalarial drugs are key to malaria management.\\n\\nEnteric fever, caused by Salmonella Typhi, is clinically indistinguishable from paratyphoid fever caused by Salmonella Paratyphi A, B, and C. It typically presents with nonspecific symptoms such as fever, headache, dry cough, and abdominal pain. The fever starts insidiously and may be afebrile in the morning, with constipation being common and foul-smelling diarrhea occurring in the course of an untreated infection. The diagnosis is confirmed by proof of S. Typhi in blood cultures or bone marrow, while stool or urine isolation indicates a carrier state. Empirical antibiotic therapy should be started promptly, with fluoroquinolones being the drugs of choice in areas without antimicrobial resistance. The case fatality rate on antibiotic treatment is less than 1%, and targeted vaccination of high-risk populations seems to be a promising strategy to control the disease. Important differential diagnoses include malaria and invasive nontyphoidal salmonellae (iNTS) infections in HIV-positive patients. The diagnosis and treatment of enteric fever are crucial in areas where the disease is endemic due to high morbidity and mortality rates.\\nScrub typhus is a common cause of pyrexia in large parts of Asia and northern Australia, transmitted by the bite of an infected larva (chigger) of a trombiculid mite. It presents with fever, severe headache, myalgia, regional or generalized lymphadenopathy, and a macular or maculopapular rash. CNS involvement is common, with presentations of diffuse encephalopathy or reversible sensorineural deafness. Diagnostic challenges require clinical suspicion and empirical antibiotic treatment. Serological tests, rapid diagnostic tests, ELISA, PCR, and culture are available for diagnosis. Standard treatment is with doxycycline 100 mg bid for 1 week.\\nInvasive non-typhoidal Salmonellae (iNTS) infection primarily presents with non-specific febrile illness, abdominal pain or history of diarrhea, mild splenomegaly, and severe anaemia. Clinically, it is characterized by aseptic fever, weight loss, and progressive weakness, with some patients reporting abdominal pain or history of diarrhea. Important differential diagnoses include typhoid and paratyphoid, malaria, and tuberculosis. The diagnosis is confirmed by detection of Salmonella enterica var Typhimurium in blood cultures, supported by relevant clinical presentation and epidemiological context. Severe anaemia is common and should prompt the clinician to look carefully for signs of TB co-infection.\\n\\nLeptospirosis is a zoonotic disease caused by pathogenic Leptospira species. The disease presents with a biphasic illness, initially non-specific symptoms such as fever, headache, and myalgias, followed by a second phase dominated by immune-mediated pathology. Classical presentation includes severe myalgias, subconjunctival hemorrhage, and jaundice. In severe cases, complications such as acute kidney injury, pulmonary involvement, and myocarditis may occur. Diagnosis is confirmed by PCR detection, MAT serology, or culture, and treatment involves antibiotics such as doxycycline, amoxicillin, or benzylpenicillin.\\nPaucibacillary leprosy primarily occurs in leprosy-endemic countries and typically presents with one or a few hypopigmented anaesthetic skin patches and thickened peripheral nerves. It is essential to consider the combination of a skin problem and signs of a neuropathy as a suspect for leprosy. Important differential diagnoses include various inflammatory or traumatic processes. Leprosy is diagnosed clinically, and the diagnosis is confirmed by skin biopsy and slit-skin smear. The diagnosis is also supported by the WHO categorization of leprosy according to the number of skin lesions, with paucibacillary leprosy being treated with rifampicin and dapsone once per month.\\nThe patient is a 55-year-old woman from Vietnam who presents with fever, headache, vomiting, confusion, and impaired consciousness. She has a petechial rash and purpuric non-blanching lesions on her trunk and leg. The patient has a history of type 2 diabetes and hypertension. The diagnosis is confirmed by lumbar puncture showing turbid cerebrospinal fluid with high neutrophil count, high protein, and low CSF glucose ratio. Blood cultures grow Streptococcus suis, sensitive to penicillin and ceftriaxone. The patient receives 12 days of antibiotic therapy and steroids, and responds to treatment but has residual bilateral hearing impairment. Key findings to diagnose this exact disease include CSF analysis, blood cultures, and Gram stain. Differential diagnoses include malaria, enteric fever, dengue fever, and melioidosis.\\n\\nBrucellosis is a zoonotic bacterial infection common in highly endemic countries like Afghanistan, presenting as a prolonged febrile illness, non-focal, with night sweats, fatigue, lymphadenopathy, and hepatosplenomegaly, and localized infection may affect various systems. Spondylitis, like in this case, is an osteoarticular complication occurring in up to 40% of cases and requires a prolonged treatment course of at least 12 weeks to avoid relapse. Diagnosis is challenging due to seroconversion in areas of high endemicity but tissue culture remains the gold standard for localized infection. Key findings for diagnosis include Brucella culture from blood or tissue samples, MRI showing spondylodiscitis with involvement of the psoas muscle, and raised CRP and ESR levels.\\nThe disease primarily occurs in hot spots around the world, including Eastern Europe, the Middle East, Central and South Asia, Central and South America, and Africa. The patient initially presents with non-specific symptoms such as fever, sweating, fatigue, weight loss, headache, and joint pain, which persisted for weeks or months. The disease may involve nearly every organ of the body, and endocarditis is a less common but serious manifestation. A definitive diagnosis requires the isolation of the bacteria from the blood, body fluids, or tissues, which can be challenging as culture may take several weeks. Importantly, brucellosis should be considered in differential diagnosis in geographical regions where malaria and tuberculosis are highly prevalent and diagnostic resources are scarce, such as in sub-Saharan Africa.\\nBartonellosis, caused by B. bacilliformis, is a vector-borne disease mainly found in the Andean valleys of Peru, transmitted by female sandflies. The disease is characterized by a severe haemolytic anaemia with jaundice, high fever, malaise, myalgias, and CNS involvement. It progresses to a chronic angioproliferative cutaneous stage ('verruga peruana') in approximately 5% of treated patients and an unknown percentage of untreated individuals. Diagnosis is made by proof of cocco-bacilli inside red blood cells, while treatment of the acute phase includes ciprofloxacin alone or combined with ceftriaxone in severe cases. The differential diagnoses include malaria and bartonellosis, as well as several non-infectious causes of haemolysis.\\n\\nAcute bacterial meningitis primarily occurs in individuals with immunocompromised status, such as HIV-positive patients, and presents with symptoms like high fever, rapid decline in consciousness, seizures, stiff neck, and altered mental status. Clinically, it is characterized by cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) analysis showing pleocytosis, increased protein, and decreased glucose. A lumbar puncture is necessary to obtain a diagnosis, and antibiotics should be administered as soon as possible. Important differential diagnoses include tuberculous meningitis, cryptococcal meningitis, and other bacterial causes like Streptococcus pneumoniae and Neisseria meningitidis.\\nTuberculous meningitis primarily occurs in settings with high tuberculosis prevalence and is characterized by florid gelatinous exudate in the subarachnoid space, causing symptoms such as fever, headache, cranial nerve palsies, and altered consciousness. Clinically, it presents as a subacute illness with systemic symptoms such as weight loss, night sweats, and cough. Key CSF findings include clear appearance, lymphocytic predominance, high protein concentration, and low CSF to plasma-glucose ratio. Important differential diagnoses include bacterial, cryptococcal, and other forms of meningitis. Diagnosis is confirmed by detection of acid-fast bacilli in CSF, culture, or molecular methods such as PCR. Treatment involves isoniazid, rifampicin, ethambutol, and pyrazinamide, with corticosteroids to improve clinical outcomes.\\nCryptococcal meningitis primarily occurs in sub-Saharan Africa and parts of Asia where HIV prevalence is high. It typically presents with sub-acute headache, cranial nerve palsies, confusion, and impaired consciousness. Clinically, it is characterized by raised intracranial pressure and non-specific cerebrospinal fluid findings. Important differential diagnoses include tuberculous meningitis and partially treated bacterial meningitis. The diagnosis is confirmed by demonstrating the fungus in the cerebrospinal fluid using methods such as India Ink staining, cryptococcal antigen detection, or fungal culture. Treatment consists of three phases: induction, consolidation, and maintenance, using drugs such as amphotericin B, flucytosine, and fluconazole. In resource-limited settings, alternative treatment regimens may be used due to poor drug availability.\\n\\n\",\n",

While there, the man tracked chimpanzees and gorillas, and visited the Marangambo Forest python cave. Fruit bats were flying in and out of the cave, but he was not touched, bitten, or scratched by the bats. Later, he ate goat stew containing intestine at a local hotel and swam in a local lake. No one fell ill during the trip. The man developed fever 12 days after visiting the python cave, 11 days after eating goat stew, and 10 days after lake swimming. Prior to travel, he was vaccinated against hepatitis A, polio, typhoid, and yellow fever. He took doxycycline as malaria prophylaxis, but admits to missing a couple of doses. At presentation, physical examination is normal except for a temperature of 40.1°C (104.2°F) and relative bradycardia (79 beats per minute). Based on his exposure history and the pulse-temperature dissociation, typhoid fever is diagnosed and ceftriaxone begun. Blood examination demonstrates mild leukopenia (2.9 x 10⁹ cells/L), moderate thrombocytopenia (66 x 10⁹ cells/L) and mildly elevated alanine aminotransferase (146 U/L) and aspartate aminotransferase (137 U/L). Rapid diagnostic testing for malaria is negative.  On hospital day 2, the man develops profuse watery diarrhoea, nausea, and vomiting, and viral gastroenteritides are considered. Repeat lab testing demonstrates acute liver failure with liver enzymes >400 U/L. Creatinine is elevated at 2.1 mg/dL. The patient develops severe abdominal pain and a maculopapular rash, which generalises over 2 days.The initial diagnose include these disease: Rickettsial infection, Lassa fever, Crimean-Congo haemorrhagic fever, Ebola, Leptospirosis. and its relevant information: Scrub typhus is a common cause of pyrexia in large parts of Asia and northern Australia, transmitted by the bite of an infected larva (chigger) of a trombiculid mite. It presents with fever, severe headache, myalgia, regional or generalized lymphadenopathy, and a macular or maculopapular rash.

Serological tests, rapid diagnostic tests, ELISA, PCR, and culture are available for diagnosis. Standard treatment is with doxycycline 100 mg bid for 1 week.\\nRabies is a viral infection caused by the Lyssavirus genus, transmitted through the bite of infected mammals, with an incubation period of 20-90 days. The paralytic form of rabies initially presents with fever, paraesthesia in the bitten limb, followed by rapid progression to quadriparesis, particularly proximal muscle involvement. Clinically, it may mimic Guillain Barre syndrome, post-vaccination encephalomyelitis, and other conditions. Laboratory confirmation involves testing for rabies-specific antibodies in saliva, CSF, or serum, and detection of viral RNA by RT-PCR from saliva or nuchal skin biopsy. Important differential diagnoses include Guillain Barre syndrome, post-vaccination encephalomyelitis, and other conditions listed in Table 91.1. The diagnosis is confirmed by detection of rabies-specific antibodies in CSF and serum, or by antigen detection using direct fluorescent antibody (dFA) test or RT-PCR on brain tissue obtained post-mortem.\\nA 51-year-old female traveller returning from Central America presents with a generalized slightly pruritic maculopapular rash, conjunctivitis, peripheral painful oedema, and generalized lymphadenopathy. The clinical presentation is highly suggestive of an arboviral infection. The diagnosis is confirmed by detection of Zika virus RNA using RT-PCR and seroconversion of IgM and IgG antibodies in acute and convalescent serum samples. Differential diagnoses include dengue and chikungunya infections.\\n\\nLassa fever is common in sub-Saharan West Africa and is thought to infect approximately 300,000 people annually. The symptoms include fever, body aches, weakness, sore throat, retrosternal chest pain, abdominal pain, diarrhea, vomiting, cough, and breathlessness, with conjunctivitis often occurring late in the disease. The disease is more severe in pregnant women, and its severity is marked by raised liver transaminases. Clinically, it is characterized by a high case fatality rate in hospitalized patients, with a particularly high case fatality rate in the third trimester of pregnancy. The diagnosis is confirmed by antigen testing, PCR, or serological tests, with the treatment being with IV ribavirin, most effective when given early in the disease. Important differential diagnoses include adenovirus infections, measles, Mycoplasma pneumoniae, Leptospirosis, and typhoid fever.\\nLoiasis, the symptomatic infection with the filarial nematode L. loa, primarily occurs in West and Central Africa. It presents with urticaria and transient painless subcutaneous swellings ('Calabar swellings'), a localized angioedema which may last from several hours to a few days. Adult worms may be spotted when migrating through the bulbar conjunctiva, causing intense itching, pain, and photophobia. Renal complications, such as glomerulonephritis and nephrotic syndrome, and a wide range of neurological symptoms have also been observed. The female worms release sheathed microfilariae detectable in the peripheral blood during daytime. Laboratory diagnosis relies on detecting microfilariae in a thick blood film or filtered blood, or using PCR (polymerase chain reaction) in amicrofilaraemic patients. Serology is not reliable due to cross-reactions with antibodies against other nematodes. Treatment with diethylcarbamazine (DEC), ivermectin, and albendazole may have severe side effects in patients with high levels of microfilariae, so sequential treatment is suggested based on the degree of microfilaraemia.\\nThis patient presents with an acute febrile illness that produces liver failure characterized by fever, jaundice, bleeding, encephalopathy, and seizures. Key findings include elevated liver transaminases, jaundice, spontaneous bleeding, and low hematocrit. The differential diagnosis includes viral hepatitis, malaria, dengue fever, leptospirosis, and severe yellow fever. Important laboratory tests for diagnosis include serial thick blood smears, dengue NS1 and IgM, blood cultures, PCR for leptospirosis, and IgM antibodies for viral hepatitis. The patient eventually died of yellow fever, as confirmed by highly positive IgM capture ELISA.\\n\\nThe patient presents with a severe febrile illness, characterized by fever, sore throat, general body ache, retrosternal chest pain, abdominal symptoms, and conjunctivitis. Hypotension and shock are also present. Bilateral conjunctivitis and no rash or lymphadenopathy are notable findings. The patient's husband died of a similar illness recently, raising the suspicion of viral haemorrhagic fever, particularly Marburg virus disease or Ebola virus disease. Differential diagnoses include malaria, typhoid fever, bacterial sepsis, measles, Zika virus, and other viral infections. The diagnosis is confirmed by detection of Marburg virus RNA or Ebola virus RNA using PCR from blood or other body fluids, with a low parasitaemia of Plasmodium falciparum.

It primarily occurs in the rainforests of South America and the Caribbean. The clinical presentation of Mayaro infection is a dengue-like, febrile illness lasting 3-7 days, characterized by chills, headache, myalgia, arthralgia, nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, and a maculopapular rash. The disease may also cause debilitating and long-lasting polyarthralgias, which are suspected to arise from the inflammatory immune response stimulated by the prolonged virus persistence in joint tissues. The differential diagnosis includes reactive arthritis and viral arthritis, while the key finding to diagnose Mayaro virus infection is the detection of specific IgM and IgG antibodies against the virus using indirect immunofluorescence assay (IFA) and plaque reduction neutralization test (PRNT).\\n\\nEbola virus disease primarily occurs in tropical rainforests in sub-Saharan Africa and typically presents with fever, headache, asthenia, myalgias, abdominal pain, nausea, vomiting, and diarrhoea, with conjunctival injection and subconjunctival haemorrhage. Clinical presentation can include non-specific symptoms and rapidly progress to haemorrhage, multiple organ dysfunction, and shock. Important differential diagnoses include malaria, typhoid fever, bacterial gastroenteritis, and leptospirosis. The diagnosis is confirmed by detection of Ebola virus using ELISA antigen and PCR tests from blood or other body fluids, supported by relevant epidemiological exposure. The disease is caused by exposure to infected bat excreta or saliva, non-human primates, or person-to-person transmission in settings of inadequate universal precautions. Treatment is supportive, with antimalarials and broad-spectrum antibiotics given until the diagnosis of viral HF is confirmed.\\nThe patient presents with a severe febrile illness, characterized by fever, sore throat, general body ache, retrosternal chest pain, abdominal symptoms, and conjunctivitis.

Differential diagnoses include malaria, typhoid fever, bacterial sepsis, measles, Zika virus, and other viral infections. The diagnosis is confirmed by detection of Marburg virus RNA or Ebola virus RNA using PCR from blood or other body fluids, with a low parasitaemia of Plasmodium falciparum. Important findings include conjunctivitis, retrosternal chest pain, and abdominal symptoms, which are indicative of the viral haemorrhagic fever.\\nThis patient presents with an acute febrile illness that produces liver failure characterized by fever, jaundice, bleeding, encephalopathy, and seizures. Key findings include elevated liver transaminases, jaundice, spontaneous bleeding, and low hematocrit. The differential diagnosis includes viral hepatitis, malaria, dengue fever, leptospirosis, and severe yellow fever. Important laboratory tests for diagnosis include serial thick blood smears, dengue NS1 and IgM, blood cultures, PCR for leptospirosis, and IgM antibodies for viral hepatitis. The patient eventually died of yellow fever, as confirmed by highly positive IgM capture ELISA.\\nThe disease in question is Mayaro virus infection, a tropical and vector-borne viral disease. It primarily occurs in the rainforests of South America and the Caribbean. The clinical presentation of Mayaro infection is a dengue-like, febrile illness lasting 3-7 days, characterized by chills, headache, myalgia, arthralgia, nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, and a maculopapular rash. The disease may also cause debilitating and long-lasting polyarthralgias, which are suspected to arise from the inflammatory immune response stimulated by the prolonged virus persistence in joint tissues. The differential diagnosis includes reactive arthritis and viral arthritis, while the key finding to diagnose Mayaro virus infection is the detection of specific IgM and IgG antibodies against the virus using indirect immunofluorescence assay (IFA) and plaque reduction neutralization test (PRNT).\\n\\nThe patient presents with a severe febrile illness, characterized by fever, sore throat, general body ache, retrosternal chest pain, abdominal symptoms, and conjunctivitis. Hypotension and shock are also present. Bilateral conjunctivitis and no rash or lymphadenopathy are notable findings. The patient's husband died of a similar illness recently, raising the suspicion of viral haemorrhagic fever, particularly Marburg virus disease or Ebola virus disease.

              " '6': {'question': {'Text': \"A 12-year-old pediatric patient with no previous health issues was brought to the emergency room with a three-day fever, headache, and extreme weakness. During a comprehensive evaluation, he was diagnosed with malaria and salmonellosis, with positive results from rapid diagnostic tests. Specific treatment with ciprofloxacin, artemeter, and lumefantrine was prescribed according to pediatric doses. Other measures were taken in the emergency department over the next six hours, including antipyretics, parenteral hydration, and continuous observation. Guidance was provided for outpatient treatment, monitoring of signs of clinical deterioration, and return to the emergency department if symptoms persisted or worsened. Two days later, the patient returns to the emergency department with persistent symptoms and marked drowsiness. A complete blood count is ordered, with results within the acceptable range, and a thick blood smear is performed using Giemsa staining. The results show the presence of trypomastigotes in the whole blood. Upon questioning, the family reported that the child had traveled approximately two years earlier to the Río Campo area in the northern continental region of Equatorial Guinea, on the border with Cameroon. Physical examination. Moist and normally colored mucous membranes. Respiratory system: numerous transmitted noises are heard. Respiratory rate (RR): 20 rpm. Tissue oxygen saturation: 97 %. Cardiovascular system: rhythmic heart sounds. Blood pressure (BP) 120/80 mmHg. Heart rate (HR): 104/bpm. Abdomen: normal. Palpation reveals deep cervical and supraclavicular lymphadenopathy. Central nervous system: Confused, disoriented in time and space, delayed response to commands, bilateral osteotendinous hyporeflexia, limited neck flexion, slight nuchal rigidity.The initial diagnose include these disease: Trypanosomiasis, Malaria, Salmonellosis, Meningitis, Encephalitis. and its relevant information: The patient presented with anaphylactic shock and a circumscribed, painless swelling on the inside of his left ankle, which was initially attributed to a tick bite. However, the presence of fever, headache, puffy face, and an erythematous rash suggested trypanosomiasis. The diagnosis was confirmed by the presence of trypanosomes in a thick blood film, and the patient was treated with suramin. The rapid progression to neurological involvement was indicated by the presence of trypanosomes in the cerebrospinal fluid (CSF), and treatment was switched to melarsoprol. Key findings that led to the diagnosis of trypanosomiasis include the presence of trypanosomes in the blood and CSF, and the patient's exposure to tsetse flies in a national game park. Important differential diagnoses include hypersensitivity reactions, invasive helminthiasis, and rickettsial disease.\\nChagas disease primarily occurs in 21 Latin American countries, including Bolivia, and is caused by the protozoan Trypanosoma cruzi. Clinical presentation includes inflammation at the inoculation point and fever in the acute phase, and asymptomatic or mild-to-moderate organ involvement in the chronic phase. The heart is the most frequent organ involved, with manifestations such as bundle branch blocks, myocardial damage, and dilated cardiomyopathy. Key findings to diagnose Chagas disease include detection of IgG antibodies against T. cruzi using two different serological testing methods, direct microscopic visualization of trypomastigotes on blood films, or PCR with varying sensitivities. Differential diagnosis includes other diseases that may present with similar symptoms, such as myocardial damage or dilated cardiomyopathy. Treatment of Chagas disease involves trypanocidal medication, such as benznidazole or nifurtimox, which may be associated with adverse events. Important indications for treatment include acute and congenital Chagas disease, and patients younger than 18 years in the chronic phase.\\nParagonimiasis is a sub-acute to chronic lung disease caused by lung flukes of the genus Paragonimus. Adult flukes live in the lungs and eggs are coughed up and either expectorated or swallowed. The disease occurs mainly via consuming raw or undercooked freshwater crabs or crayfish contaminated with Paragonimus metacercariae or eating raw wild boar meat, which is a paratenic host. Eosinophilia is prominent during acute and sub-acute infection but may be mild or absent in chronic disease. Definitive diagnosis is made by detection of ova in sputum, BAL fluid or faeces. Praziquantel is the drug of choice, effective against all Paragonimus species. Important differential diagnoses include pulmonary tuberculosis and lung cancer.\\n\\nCerebral malaria is a severe neurological complication of Plasmodium falciparum infection, primarily occurring in sub-Saharan Africa. It presents with coma, no neurological localizing signs, hepatosplenomegaly, and a positive malaria rapid diagnostic test. Key findings for diagnosis include retinal whitening, hemorrhages, or orange-white vessels with or without papilloedema on ophthalmoscopy. Important differential diagnoses include bacterial meningitis, viral encephalitis, intoxication, metabolic abnormalities, and non-convulsive status epilepticus. The diagnosis is confirmed by the presence of Plasmodium falciparum parasitemia and the absence of other causes of coma, with supportive findings of malarial retinopathy on ophthalmoscopy. The mainstay of therapy is antimalarials, intensive supportive care, and diagnosis and treatment of non-malarial contributors to illness.\\nKnowlesi malaria primarily presents with fever, thrombocytopenia, and non-specific arthralgias, and is characterized by a quotidian (daily) fever pattern with relatively high parasitaemias. The differential diagnosis includes dengue fever, chikungunya, Zika, influenza, acute HIV infection, enteric fever, and non-falciparum malaria, especially given the negative rapid diagnostic test for malaria. Diagnosis is confirmed by microscopy or PCR-based methods that distinguish *P. knowlesi* from other *Plasmodium species*, and treatment is the same as for acute falciparum malaria.\\nA 32-year-old woman from Nigeria presents with fever, jaundice, and confusion 18 days after returning from a visit to rural Nigeria. The most common cause of fever and jaundice in West Africa is severe falciparum malaria. A malaria blood film is crucial to confirm the diagnosis, and the patient should be treated as malaria and other tests taken with standard universal precautions. Severe malaria is a life-threatening infection in non-immune patients and should be on the list of differential diagnoses for any unwell patient from the tropics. Early diagnosis and effective antimalarial drugs are key to malaria management.\\n\\nInvasive non-typhoidal Salmonellae (iNTS) infection primarily presents with non-specific febrile illness, abdominal pain or history of diarrhea, mild splenomegaly, and severe anaemia. Clinically, it is characterized by aseptic fever, weight loss, and progressive weakness, with some patients reporting abdominal pain or history of diarrhea. Important differential diagnoses include typhoid and paratyphoid, malaria, and tuberculosis. The diagnosis is confirmed by detection of Salmonella enterica var Typhimurium in blood cultures, supported by relevant clinical presentation and epidemiological context. Severe anaemia is common and should prompt the clinician to look carefully for signs of TB co-infection.\\nBrucellosis is a zoonotic bacterial infection common in highly endemic countries like Afghanistan, presenting as a prolonged febrile illness, non-focal, with night sweats, fatigue, lymphadenopathy, and hepatosplenomegaly, and localized infection may affect various systems. Spondylitis, like in this case, is an osteoarticular complication occurring in up to 40% of cases and requires a prolonged treatment course of at least 12 weeks to avoid relapse. Diagnosis is challenging due to seroconversion in areas of high endemicity but tissue culture remains the gold standard for localized infection. Key findings for diagnosis include Brucella culture from blood or tissue samples, MRI showing spondylodiscitis with involvement of the psoas muscle, and raised CRP and ESR levels.\\nEnteric fever, caused by Salmonella Typhi, is clinically indistinguishable from paratyphoid fever caused by Salmonella Paratyphi A, B, and C. It typically presents with nonspecific symptoms such as fever, headache, dry cough, and abdominal pain. The fever starts insidiously and may be afebrile in the morning, with constipation being common and foul-smelling diarrhea occurring in the course of an untreated infection. The diagnosis is confirmed by proof of S. Typhi in blood cultures or bone marrow, while stool or urine isolation indicates a carrier state. Empirical antibiotic therapy should be started promptly, with fluoroquinolones being the drugs of choice in areas without antimicrobial resistance. The case fatality rate on antibiotic treatment is less than 1%, and targeted vaccination of high-risk populations seems to be a promising strategy to control the disease. Important differential diagnoses include malaria and invasive nontyphoidal salmonellae (iNTS) infections in HIV-positive patients. The diagnosis and treatment of enteric fever are crucial in areas where the disease is endemic due to high morbidity and mortality rates.\\n\\nAcute bacterial meningitis primarily occurs in individuals with immunocompromised status, such as HIV-positive patients, and presents with symptoms like high fever, rapid decline in consciousness, seizures, stiff neck, and altered mental status. Clinically, it is characterized by cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) analysis showing pleocytosis, increased protein, and decreased glucose. A lumbar puncture is necessary to obtain a diagnosis, and antibiotics should be administered as soon as possible. Important differential diagnoses include tuberculous meningitis, cryptococcal meningitis, and other bacterial causes like Streptococcus pneumoniae and Neisseria meningitidis.\\nTuberculous meningitis primarily occurs in settings with high tuberculosis prevalence and is characterized by florid gelatinous exudate in the subarachnoid space, causing symptoms such as fever, headache, cranial nerve palsies, and altered consciousness. Clinically, it presents as a subacute illness with systemic symptoms such as weight loss, night sweats, and cough. Key CSF findings include clear appearance, lymphocytic predominance, high protein concentration, and low CSF to plasma-glucose ratio. Important differential diagnoses include bacterial, cryptococcal, and other forms of meningitis. Diagnosis is confirmed by detection of acid-fast bacilli in CSF, culture, or molecular methods such as PCR. Treatment involves isoniazid, rifampicin, ethambutol, and pyrazinamide, with corticosteroids to improve clinical outcomes.\\nCryptococcal meningitis primarily occurs in sub-Saharan Africa and parts of Asia where HIV prevalence is high. It typically presents with sub-acute headache, cranial nerve palsies, confusion, and impaired consciousness. Clinically, it is characterized by raised intracranial pressure and non-specific cerebrospinal fluid findings. Important differential diagnoses include tuberculous meningitis and partially treated bacterial meningitis. The diagnosis is confirmed by demonstrating the fungus in the cerebrospinal fluid using methods such as India Ink staining, cryptococcal antigen detection, or fungal culture. Treatment consists of three phases: induction, consolidation, and maintenance, using drugs such as amphotericin B, flucytosine, and fluconazole. In resource-limited settings, alternative treatment regimens may be used due to poor drug availability.\\n\\nNeurocysticercosis presents with symptoms of focal epileptic seizures, with most common presentation being symptoms of 'pins and needles' sensation in a part of the body. It's caused by neurocysticercosis caused by the pork tapeworm Taenia solium, acquired after consuming food contaminated with T. solium eggs, which release oncospheres that infect the brain and form encysted larvae. Key findings to diagnose include neuroimaging showing multiple cystic lesions, supported by clinical presentation of focal seizures. Differential diagnoses in the context include hydrocephalus, cerebral oedema, and meningitis. The diagnosis is confirmed by serological and epidemiological evidence. Treatment includes antiparasitic drugs like albendazole or a combination of albendazole and praziquantel, in addition to steroid therapy.\\nThe disease primarily affects individuals born and living in areas with poor sanitation services and uncorralled pigs, such as rural Guatemala. It typically presents with transitory ischemic attacks, manifesting as parenchymal calcified lesions, complex cystic structures in the subarachnoid space, and an old lacunar infarct. Subarachnoid neurocysticercosis, the most severe form, is probably caused by the host's inflammatory response, manifesting as meningitis, communicating hydrocephalus, focal neurological symptoms, and cerebrovascular disease. Important differential diagnoses include other forms of neurocysticercosis, such as parenchymal neurocysticercosis, and other diseases causing similar imaging findings. The diagnosis is confirmed by MRI and serology, specifically the immunoblot with a sensitivity of 98% and specificity of near 100%, showing a high burden of disease. Treatment involves dual therapy with albendazole and praziquantel, corticosteroids, and a careful taper to avoid complications. The duration of treatment is still controversial, but current guidelines recommend treating until resolution on neuroimaging.\\nTuberculous meningitis primarily occurs in settings with high tuberculosis prevalence and is characterized by florid gelatinous exudate in the subarachnoid space, causing symptoms such as fever, headache, cranial nerve palsies, and altered consciousness.

The presenting complains were itching,  gritty and  foreign body sensation  in the right eye. There was no family history of ocular or medical condition. On examination with Snellen acuity, the unaided distant, visual acuity in the right eye was 6/12 and left eye was 6/9 and near visual acuity was N5 at 40cm. Pinhole visual acuity improved to 6/6 in both eyes and preliminary external examination using penlight showed smooth ocular motility, a clear conjuctiva, clear cornea and a normal pupillary  re\\ue6c0ex. Contact  tonometry using perkins applanation tonometer revealed 16mmHg and 15mmHg in the right  and left  eye respectively.  The blood  pressure was 100/80mmHg and pulse rate of  60b/min. Random  blood sugar was 88mg/dL. A funduscopy examination revealed a cup to disc ratio of 0.2 and normal blood vessels and macula in  both eyes. The anterior segment examination under slit lamp biomicroscope con\\ue6bfrmed the anterior segment of the eye to be normal but revealed the presence of a live adult nematode worm estimated to be about 450 mm in length with a diameter of 0.5 mm visible in the lateral subconjunctival space  of the  right eye while posterior segment examination was essentially normal. Attempts to remove the worm with toothless forceps was not  successful particularly because the patient was  apprehensive. Following  assessment, she was prescribed Bethamesone + Neomycin () eyedrop 1drop 3x daily for use on the right eye and follow up was scheduled the next day. On return to clinic next day being 22nd February 2020, the patient was  less apprehensive after  counselling. Surgical  procedure under local topical anesthesia was conducted and the worm was successfully removed. Chloramphenicol ointment was  inserted on the right eye and padded to be reviewed in 4 days.The initial diagnose include these disease: Thelaziasis, Loiasis, Onchocerciasis, Toxocariasis, Dracunculiasis. and its relevant information: Loiasis, the symptomatic infection with the filarial nematode L. loa, primarily occurs in West and Central Africa. It presents with urticaria and transient painless subcutaneous swellings (\\'Calabar swellings\\'), a localized angioedema which may last from several hours to a few days. Adult worms may be spotted when migrating through the bulbar conjunctiva, causing intense itching, pain, and photophobia. Renal complications, such as glomerulonephritis and nephrotic syndrome, and a wide range of neurological symptoms have also been observed. The female worms release sheathed microfilariae detectable in the peripheral blood during daytime. Laboratory diagnosis relies on detecting microfilariae in a thick blood film or filtered blood, or using PCR (polymerase chain reaction) in amicrofilaraemic patients. Serology is not reliable due to cross-reactions with antibodies against other nematodes. Treatment with diethylcarbamazine (DEC), ivermectin, and albendazole may have severe side effects in patients with high levels of microfilariae, so sequential treatment is suggested based on the degree of microfilaraemia.\\nFascioliasis, a serious public health problem, primarily affects people in the Andean countries, including Peru, caused by ingestion of metacercariae-contaminated watercress or drinking water. The disease includes four clinical phases and typically presents with intermittent fever, abdominal pain, malaise, weight loss, urticaria, and eosinophilia in the acute phase, while ova appear in the stool in the latent phase. Important differential diagnoses include pyogenic liver abscesses, amoebic liver abscess, brucellosis, visceral toxocariasis, and secondary infections. Diagnosis is confirmed by serological methods, such as the Fas2 ELISA, and treatment with triclabendazole is effective in almost 90% of cases.\\nSporotrichosis is a sub-acute to chronic fungal infection caused by Sporothrix schenckii. It typically presents with a slowly growing ulcer and multiple painless nodules on the lymphatic tract of the affected limb after minor trauma, usually by plant thorns or other cutting vegetation. In the chronic phase, it can progress and cause disseminated disease, particularly among immunosuppressed individuals and those with pre-existing chronic conditions. Important differential diagnoses include cutaneous leishmaniasis, Mycobacterium tuberculosis or M. marinum, Nocardiosis, and tularemia. The diagnosis can be challenging, and specimens are often required for microscopy, culture, or PCR for Leishmania, Mycobacterium, and Sporothrix species. The recommended treatment for cutaneous sporotrichosis is itraconazole 200 mg/day for 3-6 months or saturated solution of potassium iodide, and itraconazole (200mg PO bd) for 1–2 years for pulmonary and osteoarticular sporotrichosis.\\n\\nLoiasis, the symptomatic infection with the filarial nematode L. loa, primarily occurs in West and Central Africa.

The symptoms include fever, body aches, weakness, sore throat, retrosternal chest pain, abdominal pain, diarrhea, vomiting, cough, and breathlessness, with conjunctivitis often occurring late in the disease. The disease is more severe in pregnant women, and its severity is marked by raised liver transaminases. Clinically, it is characterized by a high case fatality rate in hospitalized patients, with a particularly high case fatality rate in the third trimester of pregnancy. The diagnosis is confirmed by antigen testing, PCR, or serological tests, with the treatment being with IV ribavirin, most effective when given early in the disease. Important differential diagnoses include adenovirus infections, measles, Mycoplasma pneumoniae, Leptospirosis, and typhoid fever.\\n\\nOnchocerciasis, also known as \"river blindness,\" primarily occurs in rural areas near rapidly flowing rivers, particularly in West and Central Africa. The disease is characterized by a triad of ocular changes, skin changes, and subcutaneous nodules. Typical clinical features include non-tender subcutaneous nodules, dermatitis, depigmentation of the skin, and ocular changes such as keratitis, iritis, and uveitis. The diagnosis is typically made based on clinical findings and supported by serological tests. The most important differential diagnoses to consider are other causes of skin changes and ocular changes such as scabies, yaws, leprosy, mycotic infections, and eczema. The key finding to diagnose onchocerciasis is the presence of subcutaneous nodules with microfilariae of Onchocerca volvulus, which can be detected by skin snips, slit-lamp examination, or nodulectomy. The diagnosis is confirmed by detection of antibodies to O. volvulus antigens through serological tests. Treatment typically involves multiple courses of ivermectin, with or without doxycycline, and is usually provided annually in mass treatment programs.\\nThe disease primarily affects individuals born and living in areas with poor sanitation services and uncorralled pigs, such as rural Guatemala. It typically presents with transitory ischemic attacks, manifesting as parenchymal calcified lesions, complex cystic structures in the subarachnoid space, and an old lacunar infarct.

Treatment involves dual therapy with albendazole and praziquantel, corticosteroids, and a careful taper to avoid complications. The duration of treatment is still controversial, but current guidelines recommend treating until resolution on neuroimaging.\\nA creeping eruption characterized by a linear or serpiginous, slightly elevated, erythematous track that moves forward in an irregular pattern, primarily caused by cutaneous larva migrans (CLM) due to larvae of animal hookworms, especially Ancylostoma caninum, A. braziliense, and Uncinaria stenocephala. Key symptoms include intense itchy skin eruptions, usually on the feet or areas exposed to infested sand/soil. Diagnosis is made clinically and supported by travel history, and confirmed by the presence of pruritic papules and progressing erythematous tracks with variable speed, depending on the hookworm species. The diagnosis does not rely on skin biopsy, because the larva is always in advance of its track, and no reliable serological tests are available. Treatment of choice is ivermectin (200 μg/kg for 1-2 days), or albendazole 400mg twice daily for 3 days in case of ivermectin contraindication or unavailability. Differential diagnoses include infection with larvae of Strongyloides stercoralis (larva currens), Gnathostoma species, and Fasciola species, as well as migratory myiasis.\\n\\nSporotrichosis is a sub-acute to chronic fungal infection caused by Sporothrix schenckii.

Humans are exposed through infected animals or contaminated animal products. The disease presents as cutaneous (95% of cases), with a painless central ulcer, vesicles, and extensive surrounding edema. Systemic symptoms include malaise and headache, while fever and leukocytosis may not be present. Important differential diagnoses include bacterial ecthyma, rickettsial diseases, rat-bite fevers, necrotic arachnidism, ulceroglandular tularaemia, and bubonic plague. The diagnosis is confirmed by detection of *B. anthracis* in blood, skin lesion aspirate, or pleural fluid through Gram stain and culture or PCR and IHC staining. Empirical antibacterial treatment with a quinolone or doxycycline is initiated while awaiting microbiological results.\\n\\nMycobacterium ulcerans disease, commonly known as Buruli ulcer, primarily occurs in West Africa, mainly in children and adolescents, and presents with skin lesions ranging from papules, nodules, and plaques to ulcers. The lesions are typically painless but may be painful, and they can involve most of a limb surface or trunk, sometimes occurring at different body sites. Key findings for diagnosis include a history of living in an endemic area, particularly near water bodies such as rivers and lakes, and the presence of skin lesions showing skin alterations like induration, hypo- and hyperpigmentation, lichenification, desquamation, and possibly local edema. Important differential diagnoses include traumatic, infectious, and neoplastic causes of ulcers. The diagnosis is confirmed by PCR from a wound swab, and treatment involves combination therapy with rifampicin, streptomycin, or clarithromycin for eight weeks, along with local heat application, wound care, pain relief, surgical excision, and skin grafting, as well as physiotherapy for restricted movements.\\nThe disease primarily affects individuals born and living in areas with poor sanitation services and uncorralled pigs, such as rural Guatemala. It typically presents with transitory ischemic attacks, manifesting as parenchymal calcified lesions, complex cystic structures in the subarachnoid space, and an old lacunar infarct. Subarachnoid neurocysticercosis, the most severe form, is probably caused by the host\\'s inflammatory response, manifesting as meningitis, communicating hydrocephalus, focal neurological symptoms, and cerebrovascular disease. Important differential diagnoses include other forms of neurocysticercosis, such as parenchymal neurocysticercosis, and other diseases causing similar imaging findings. The diagnosis is confirmed by MRI and serology, specifically the immunoblot with a sensitivity of 98% and specificity of near 100%, showing a high burden of disease. Treatment involves dual therapy with albendazole and praziquantel, corticosteroids, and a careful taper to avoid complications. The duration of treatment is still controversial, but current guidelines recommend treating until resolution on neuroimaging.\\nOnchocerciasis, also known as \"river blindness,\" primarily occurs in rural areas near rapidly flowing rivers, particularly in West and Central Africa. The disease is characterized by a triad of ocular changes, skin changes, and subcutaneous nodules. Typical clinical features include non-tender subcutaneous nodules, dermatitis, depigmentation of the skin, and ocular changes such as keratitis, iritis, and uveitis. The diagnosis is typically made based on clinical findings and supported by serological tests. The most important differential diagnoses to consider are other causes of skin changes and ocular changes such as scabies, yaws, leprosy, mycotic infections, and eczema. The key finding to diagnose onchocerciasis is the presence of subcutaneous nodules with microfilariae of Onchocerca volvulus, which can be detected by skin snips, slit-lamp examination, or nodulectomy. The diagnosis is confirmed by detection of antibodies to O. volvulus antigens through serological tests. Treatment typically involves multiple courses of ivermectin, with or without doxycycline, and is usually provided annually in mass treatment programs.\\n\\n',\n",

She felt numbness at the tip of her fingers and toes for 4 days, but denied contact with any chemicals. Thirty years ago, she spent a week at her father-in-law's house after he was diagnosed with leprosy. No other family members or relatives showed symptom. Skin examination revealed asymmetrical, multiple, discrete, poorly defined borders and hyperpigmented plaques with decreased sensation on her back, nose, and both cheeks, loss of the outer two-thirds of both eyebrows, and infiltrated plaques on both earlobes. Neurological examination revealed a decrease in sensation of pain and temperature at the tips of her fingers and toes. Other physical examinations and peripheral nerve findings were unremarkable. At this stage, the provisional diagnosis of the patient's illness was leprosy. We then obtained slit skin smears of both earlobes and plaques of the skin on her back. Acid-fast staining of the samples revealed the presence of acid-fast stained bacilli  in all slit skin samples.The initial diagnose include these disease: Leprosy, tuberculoid leprosy, borderline leprosy, multibacillary leprosy, paucibacillary leprosy. and its relevant information: Paucibacillary leprosy primarily occurs in leprosy-endemic countries and typically presents with one or a few hypopigmented anaesthetic skin patches and thickened peripheral nerves. It is essential to consider the combination of a skin problem and signs of a neuropathy as a suspect for leprosy. Important differential diagnoses include various inflammatory or traumatic processes.

The diagnosis is also supported by the WHO categorization of leprosy according to the number of skin lesions, with paucibacillary leprosy being treated with rifampicin and dapsone once per month.\\nLeptospirosis is a zoonotic disease caused by pathogenic Leptospira species. The disease presents with a biphasic illness, initially non-specific symptoms such as fever, headache, and myalgias, followed by a second phase dominated by immune-mediated pathology. Classical presentation includes severe myalgias, subconjunctival hemorrhage, and jaundice. In severe cases, complications such as acute kidney injury, pulmonary involvement, and myocarditis may occur. Diagnosis is confirmed by PCR detection, MAT serology, or culture, and treatment involves antibiotics such as doxycycline, amoxicillin, or benzylpenicillin.\\nNeurolathyrism is a preventable toxic myelopathy caused by excessive ingestion of the Lathyrus sativus grass pea, primarily occurring in drought- or monsoon-prone areas. The clinical presentation is an irreversible acute to subacute spastic paraparesis or quadriparesis without prominent sensory involvement, with bladder and bowel function maintained. The diagnosis is based on a history of prolonged heavy ingestion of grass peas, particularly among young, malnourished, physically exerted males, and exclusion of other myelopathies. Key findings for diagnosis include exposure to L. sativus, dose-dependent toxicity, and characteristic gait disturbance. The differential diagnosis may include HTLV-associated myelopathy (HAM), neurocassavism (konzo), and compressive, hereditary, infectious, and metabolic myelopathies. Management involves symptomatic treatment with anti-spastic drugs and physiotherapy, while prevention includes education on avoidance of L. sativus consumption and measures to reduce toxin burden.\\n\\nPaucibacillary leprosy primarily occurs in leprosy-endemic countries and typically presents with one or a few hypopigmented anaesthetic skin patches and thickened peripheral nerves.

Clinically, it presents as a subacute illness with systemic symptoms such as weight loss, night sweats, and cough. Key CSF findings include clear appearance, lymphocytic predominance, high protein concentration, and low CSF to plasma-glucose ratio. Important differential diagnoses include bacterial, cryptococcal, and other forms of meningitis. Diagnosis is confirmed by detection of acid-fast bacilli in CSF, culture, or molecular methods such as PCR. Treatment involves isoniazid, rifampicin, ethambutol, and pyrazinamide, with corticosteroids to improve clinical outcomes.\\nSpinal tuberculosis is a common cause of tuberculous paraplegia and represents two-thirds of cases. It is characterized by focal areas of erosions and osseous destruction in the anterior corners of the vertebral bodies, involvement of the adjacent disc or vertebral body, 'wedging,' gibbus deformity or paraspinal abscess formation. Compressive spinal cord involvement is a common complication caused by accumulation of epidural caseous debris or by vertebral collapse or dislocation. Diagnosis is confirmed by CT-guided percutaneous vertebral or paravertebral biopsy and aspiration. The diagnosis involves the same antituberculous therapy as for pulmonary TB. The progression of bone destruction continues for up to 1 year after the effective antituberculous treatment has been initiated and should not be taken as a sign of treatment failure. Important differential diagnoses include spinal metastases, degenerative spinal disease, slipped disc, schistosomiasis, autoimmune transverse myelitis, and HIV-associated vacuolar myelopathy. The diagnosis of spinal tuberculosis is confirmed by detection of Mycobacterium tuberculosis using PCR-based technology such as GeneXpert from biopsied tissue, supported by relevant spinal radiography and clinical presentation.\\n\\nPaucibacillary leprosy primarily occurs in leprosy-endemic countries and typically presents with one or a few hypopigmented anaesthetic skin patches and thickened peripheral nerves.

It typically presents with a slowly growing ulcer and multiple painless nodules on the lymphatic tract of the affected limb after minor trauma, usually by plant thorns or other cutting vegetation. In the chronic phase, it can progress and cause disseminated disease, particularly among immunosuppressed individuals and those with pre-existing chronic conditions. Important differential diagnoses include cutaneous leishmaniasis, Mycobacterium tuberculosis or M. marinum, Nocardiosis, and tularemia. The diagnosis can be challenging, and specimens are often required for microscopy, culture, or PCR for Leishmania, Mycobacterium, and Sporothrix species. The recommended treatment for cutaneous sporotrichosis is itraconazole 200 mg/day for 3-6 months or saturated solution of potassium iodide, and itraconazole (200mg PO bd) for 1–2 years for pulmonary and osteoarticular sporotrichosis.\\nChromoblastomycosis is a chronic fungal infection of the skin and subcutaneous tissue, most commonly of hands, feet, and lower legs. It is typically caused by traumatic percutaneous inoculation of the genera Fonsecaea, Phialophora, and Cladophialophora.  The infection presents as painless lesions that develop slowly over years from the site of inoculation as verrucous nodules or plaques, gradually spreading centripetally by lymphatic or cutaneous dissemination. The disease is commonly found in rural tropical and subtropical areas and affects male agricultural workers. Important differential diagnoses include mycetoma, cutaneous tuberculosis, lepromatous leprosy, infections with atypical mycobacteria, cutaneous leishmaniasis, Kaposi\\'s Sarcoma, and non-infectious causes such as squamous cell carcinoma, sarcoidosis, chronic eczema, and psoriasis. The diagnosis is made by direct microscopic detection of pathognomonic sclerotic cells in skin scrapings, which are brownish, round, thick-walled structures of 4 to 12 µm length.

Key symptoms include intense itchy skin eruptions, usually on the feet or areas exposed to infested sand/soil. Diagnosis is made clinically and supported by travel history, and confirmed by the presence of pruritic papules and progressing erythematous tracks with variable speed, depending on the hookworm species. The diagnosis does not rely on skin biopsy, because the larva is always in advance of its track, and no reliable serological tests are available. Treatment of choice is ivermectin (200 μg/kg for 1-2 days), or albendazole 400mg twice daily for 3 days in case of ivermectin contraindication or unavailability.

Furthermore, multiple fissured hyperkeratotic lesions were observed, with a psoriasiform appearance, a yellowish-brown color, and a general distribution, although they mainly affected the hands and feet. In addition, scaly lesions were observed distributed on both elbows, the anterior neck, and the posterior region of the thorax. The keratotic plaques were firm and tender on palpation and were accompanied by pruritus. Direct scraping of the injured skin on the hand was performed with a number 10 scalpel blade, then the sample was placed on a slide and a drop of mineral oil was added (Muller\\'s test). Microscopic analysis reveals the presence of an ovoid body similar to a turtle (idiosome), endowed with four pairs of short legs, revealing infestation by Sarcoptes scabiei, which confirmed the diagnostic suspicion of CS.The initial diagnose include these disease: Crusted scabies, Norwegian scabies, Hyperkeratosis, Ichthyosis, Dermatitis. and its relevant information: Crusted scabies primarily occurs in individuals with weakened immune systems, such as those with HIV, HTLV-1, immunosuppressive therapy, or certain medical conditions. It typically presents with a widespread, exfoliating rash, often involving the hands, feet, neck, face, scalp, axillae, trunk, buttocks, and limbs, often accompanied by secondary bacterial infections. Clinically, it is characterized by the presence of hyperkeratotic skin crusts, mites in skin lesions, and shedding of skin flakes onto bed linen and floors. Important differential diagnoses include psoriasis, tinea corporis, skin malignancies, nutritional deficiencies, onchocerciasis, lepromatous leprosy, and secondary syphilis. Diagnosis is confirmed by microscopy of skin scrapings under low-power magnification. The treatment typically involves topical scabicides, oral ivermectin, and keratolytic cream. Initial management includes oxygen therapy, fluid resuscitation, and antibiotic treatment for sepsis.\\nTungiasis primarily occurs in Latin America, the Caribbean, and sub-Saharan Africa, typically presenting with a slowly growing node on the skin, often near the nail bed, surrounding inflammatory reaction, and sometimes itching or pain. Clinically, it is characterized by a pale nodule with a dark centre that can turn brown with a dark scab. Important differential diagnoses include scabies and other ectoparasitic infestations. The diagnosis is usually based on clinical presentation, but can be confirmed by demonstrating the parasite and its eggs in tissue samples and histopathological sections. Treatment consists of removing the flea with a sterile needle or curette, disinfection, and prevention or treatment of concomitant bacterial infections. Removal can be done with or without local anaesthesia and usually heals within a week without complications.\\nA creeping eruption characterized by a linear or serpiginous, slightly elevated, erythematous track that moves forward in an irregular pattern, primarily caused by cutaneous larva migrans (CLM) due to larvae of animal hookworms, especially Ancylostoma caninum, A. braziliense, and Uncinaria stenocephala. Key symptoms include intense itchy skin eruptions, usually on the feet or areas exposed to infested sand/soil. Diagnosis is made clinically and supported by travel history, and confirmed by the presence of pruritic papules and progressing erythematous tracks with variable speed, depending on the hookworm species. The diagnosis does not rely on skin biopsy, because the larva is always in advance of its track, and no reliable serological tests are available. Treatment of choice is ivermectin (200 μg/kg for 1-2 days), or albendazole 400mg twice daily for 3 days in case of ivermectin contraindication or unavailability. Differential diagnoses include infection with larvae of Strongyloides stercoralis (larva currens), Gnathostoma species, and Fasciola species, as well as migratory myiasis.\\n\\nCrusted scabies primarily occurs in individuals with weakened immune systems, such as those with HIV, HTLV-1, immunosuppressive therapy, or certain medical conditions.

Clinical presentation includes hepatomegaly, depigmented hair, flaky and infected skin with pale patches, and miserable and apathetic behavior. The diagnosis can be distinguished from nephrotic syndrome by proteinuria < 1+ on urine dipstick test and the presence of other symptoms like skin changes and hair damage. Laboratory confirmation involves measuring serum albumin and haemoglobin levels. Differential diagnosis includes severe acute malnutrition, malaria, and other infections. Management involves careful feeding with slowly increasing amounts of feeds, monitoring of glucose levels, weight gain, and fluid status, and prophylactic broad-spectrum antibiotics.\\nOnchocerciasis, also known as \"river blindness,\" primarily occurs in rural areas near rapidly flowing rivers, particularly in West and Central Africa. The disease is characterized by a triad of ocular changes, skin changes, and subcutaneous nodules. Typical clinical features include non-tender subcutaneous nodules, dermatitis, depigmentation of the skin, and ocular changes such as keratitis, iritis, and uveitis. The diagnosis is typically made based on clinical findings and supported by serological tests. The most important differential diagnoses to consider are other causes of skin changes and ocular changes such as scabies, yaws, leprosy, mycotic infections, and eczema. The key finding to diagnose onchocerciasis is the presence of subcutaneous nodules with microfilariae of Onchocerca volvulus, which can be detected by skin snips, slit-lamp examination, or nodulectomy. The diagnosis is confirmed by detection of antibodies to O. volvulus antigens through serological tests. Treatment typically involves multiple courses of ivermectin, with or without doxycycline, and is usually provided annually in mass treatment programs.\\nThe disease primarily affects individuals born and living in areas with poor sanitation services and uncorralled pigs, such as rural Guatemala. It typically presents with transitory ischemic attacks, manifesting as parenchymal calcified lesions, complex cystic structures in the subarachnoid space, and an old lacunar infarct. Subarachnoid neurocysticercosis, the most severe form, is probably caused by the host\\'s inflammatory response, manifesting as meningitis, communicating hydrocephalus, focal neurological symptoms, and cerebrovascular disease. Important differential diagnoses include other forms of neurocysticercosis, such as parenchymal neurocysticercosis, and other diseases causing similar imaging findings. The diagnosis is confirmed by MRI and serology, specifically the immunoblot with a sensitivity of 98% and specificity of near 100%, showing a high burden of disease. Treatment involves dual therapy with albendazole and praziquantel, corticosteroids, and a careful taper to avoid complications. The duration of treatment is still controversial, but current guidelines recommend treating until resolution on neuroimaging.\\n\\nA creeping eruption characterized by a linear or serpiginous, slightly elevated, erythematous track that moves forward in an irregular pattern, primarily caused by cutaneous larva migrans (CLM) due to larvae of animal hookworms, especially Ancylostoma caninum, A. braziliense, and Uncinaria stenocephala.

Differential diagnoses include infection with larvae of Strongyloides stercoralis (larva currens), Gnathostoma species, and Fasciola species, as well as migratory myiasis.\\nCystic echinococcosis (CE) is characterized by the development of cystic lesions in the liver or lungs due to the larval form of the Echinococcus granulosus tapeworm. The primary symptom is abdominal pain, but it may progress to biliary obstruction, bacterial infection, cyst rupture, or compression syndromes. The diagnosis is based on imaging, mainly ultrasound, and classification of disease activity. Treatment options include anthelmintic therapy, percutaneous intervention, surgery, or a \\'watch and wait\\' approach, depending on the individual case, local resources, and disease activity. The key to effective management is early detection of complications and long-term follow-up to prevent recurrence.\\nCrusted scabies primarily occurs in individuals with weakened immune systems, such as those with HIV, HTLV-1, immunosuppressive therapy, or certain medical conditions.

Humans are exposed through infected animals or contaminated animal products. The disease presents as cutaneous (95% of cases), with a painless central ulcer, vesicles, and extensive surrounding edema. Systemic symptoms include malaise and headache, while fever and leukocytosis may not be present. Important differential diagnoses include bacterial ecthyma, rickettsial diseases, rat-bite fevers, necrotic arachnidism, ulceroglandular tularaemia, and bubonic plague. The diagnosis is confirmed by detection of *B. anthracis* in blood, skin lesion aspirate, or pleural fluid through Gram stain and culture or PCR and IHC staining.

In 2013, adalimumab (one injection/15 days) plus methotrexate (10mg/week) was used due to poor progress. Since then, she has not required steroids and has remained asymptomatic with this therapeutic approach. She recently presented a mucocutaneous, erythematous and ulcerous lesion in the nasal vestibule and the upper lip that has deformed her nose (Fig. 1). For this reason, she was referred to the ENT department, where a biopsy was performed and the subsequent anatomopathological study was diagnostic of leishmaniasis, both by direct vision with the Giemsa technique and by nested polymerase chain reaction. The patient had not travelled to particularly endemic areas of this disease, nor lived with animals, nor had she any record of a bite.The initial diagnose include these disease: Leishmaniasis, Cutaneous Leishmaniasis, Mucocutaneous Leishmaniasis, Rheumatoid Arthritis, Immunosuppression. and its relevant information: Cutaneous leishmaniasis typically occurs in areas where sand flies are present, such as the Andes in Peru. It presents as a localized painless ulcer with raised edges, often on exposed parts of the skin. The diagnosis is confirmed by demonstration of the parasite using microscopic examination, culture or molecular techniques. Differential diagnoses include sporotrichosis, cutaneous tuberculosis, and infection by Balamuthia mandrillaris. The treatment involves systemic therapy with first-line drugs such as pentavalent antimonials, and second-line drugs like Amphotericin B or liposomal Amphotericin B may be considered, especially for L. (V.) braziliensis infection.\\nVisceral Leishmaniasis primarily occurs in East Africa and the Indian subcontinent, particularly in five countries (India, Sudan, South Sudan, Ethiopia, and Brazil). The clinical presentation includes chronic fever, fatigue, anorexia, weight loss, enlarged lymph nodes, splenomegaly, and hepatomegaly. It typically presents in 2-8 months after the sandfly bite. Laboratory results show pancytopenia, with depletion of all three cell lines in the FBC. A direct proof of the parasite is the classic confirmatory test for VL, but in low-resource settings, serological tests are often used instead, such as the rK39 immuno-chromatographic test (ICT), the Direct Agglutination Test (DAT), and semiquantitative DAT. The diagnosis is challenging due to variable sensitivity and specificity of these tests. The most important differential diagnoses include malaria, brucellosis, tuberculosis, HIV infection, typhoid fever, splenic abscess, chronic schistosomiasis, and malignancies. The key findings to diagnose this exact disease include a positive Direct Agglutination Test or semiquantitative DAT with a high titre, and demonstration of Leishmania amastigotes in samples from the bone marrow, spleen, and lymph node.\\nLoiasis, the symptomatic infection with the filarial nematode L. loa, primarily occurs in West and Central Africa. It presents with urticaria and transient painless subcutaneous swellings ('Calabar swellings'), a localized angioedema which may last from several hours to a few days. Adult worms may be spotted when migrating through the bulbar conjunctiva, causing intense itching, pain, and photophobia. Renal complications, such as glomerulonephritis and nephrotic syndrome, and a wide range of neurological symptoms have also been observed. The female worms release sheathed microfilariae detectable in the peripheral blood during daytime. Laboratory diagnosis relies on detecting microfilariae in a thick blood film or filtered blood, or using PCR (polymerase chain reaction) in amicrofilaraemic patients. Serology is not reliable due to cross-reactions with antibodies against other nematodes. Treatment with diethylcarbamazine (DEC), ivermectin, and albendazole may have severe side effects in patients with high levels of microfilariae, so sequential treatment is suggested based on the degree of microfilaraemia.\\n\\nCutaneous leishmaniasis typically occurs in areas where sand flies are present, such as the Andes in Peru.

The symptoms started 6-8 weeks after her return from a family visit to northern Thailand. On examination, multiple cutaneous and subcutaneous abscesses and a generalized lymphadenopathy are noted. Laboratory findings show elevated systemic markers of inflammation. The clinical picture and laboratory findings are highly suspicious of a systemic infection, and differential diagnoses include histoplasmosis, mycobacterial infections (such as melioidosis), and autoimmune syndromes. Key findings to diagnose Histoplasmosis include fungal cells identified on histopathology of a lymph node biopsy, and the presence of Histoplasma capsulatum confirmed by PCR and culture.\\n\\nThe disease in question is Mayaro virus infection, a tropical and vector-borne viral disease. It primarily occurs in the rainforests of South America and the Caribbean. The clinical presentation of Mayaro infection is a dengue-like, febrile illness lasting 3-7 days, characterized by chills, headache, myalgia, arthralgia, nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, and a maculopapular rash. The disease may also cause debilitating and long-lasting polyarthralgias, which are suspected to arise from the inflammatory immune response stimulated by the prolonged virus persistence in joint tissues. The differential diagnosis includes reactive arthritis and viral arthritis, while the key finding to diagnose Mayaro virus infection is the detection of specific IgM and IgG antibodies against the virus using indirect immunofluorescence assay (IFA) and plaque reduction neutralization test (PRNT).\\nRabies is a viral infection caused by the Lyssavirus genus, transmitted through the bite of infected mammals, with an incubation period of 20-90 days. The paralytic form of rabies initially presents with fever, paraesthesia in the bitten limb, followed by rapid progression to quadriparesis, particularly proximal muscle involvement. Clinically, it may mimic Guillain Barre syndrome, post-vaccination encephalomyelitis, and other conditions. Laboratory confirmation involves testing for rabies-specific antibodies in saliva, CSF, or serum, and detection of viral RNA by RT-PCR from saliva or nuchal skin biopsy. Important differential diagnoses include Guillain Barre syndrome, post-vaccination encephalomyelitis, and other conditions listed in Table 91.1. The diagnosis is confirmed by detection of rabies-specific antibodies in CSF and serum, or by antigen detection using direct fluorescent antibody (dFA) test or RT-PCR on brain tissue obtained post-mortem.\\nAnthrax is a zoonotic disease caused by *B. anthracis*, primarily affecting herbivores.

However, the presence of fever, headache, puffy face, and an erythematous rash suggested trypanosomiasis. The diagnosis was confirmed by the presence of trypanosomes in a thick blood film, and the patient was treated with suramin. The rapid progression to neurological involvement was indicated by the presence of trypanosomes in the cerebrospinal fluid (CSF), and treatment was switched to melarsoprol. Key findings that led to the diagnosis of trypanosomiasis include the presence of trypanosomes in the blood and CSF, and the patient's exposure to tsetse flies in a national game park. Important differential diagnoses include hypersensitivity reactions, invasive helminthiasis, and rickettsial disease.\\nLeptospirosis is a zoonotic disease caused by pathogenic Leptospira species. The disease presents with a biphasic illness, initially non-specific symptoms such as fever, headache, and myalgias, followed by a second phase dominated by immune-mediated pathology. Classical presentation includes severe myalgias, subconjunctival hemorrhage, and jaundice. In severe cases, complications such as acute kidney injury, pulmonary involvement, and myocarditis may occur.

He had no known medical comorbidities or allergies. He was originally from Bolivia but had lived in Europe for the last 15 years (Ireland for the past year). The patient worked as a mechanic, had no pets, no recent travel history and no unusual contacts or hobbies. In the preceding 4 weeks and prior to his deterioration, he had presented on two separate occasions to a hospital emergency department – once to hospital A and once to hospital B, a different hospital in the city. At the first visit, which was to hospital A, the patient reported a mild headache, which responded to analgesia with no red flag symptoms. Blood tests were taken, including a routine opt-out bloodborne viral (BBV) screen. The patient was discharged from the ED. The BBV screen was subsequently reported as reactive for HIV antigen and antibody. Multiple unsuccessful attempts were made by staff to contact the patient by telephone and post. Two weeks later, the patient was brought back to the emergency department of hospital A. He presented with reduced consciousness. The patient’s housemates, who accompanied him to the hospital, reported worsening drowsiness over the preceding days. On initial examination, Glasgow Coma Scale (GCS) was 12/15, with unequal pupils. His temperature was 40.0°C and his heart rate was 120 beats per minute. Initial oxygen saturation was 99% in room air. One hour after presentation, GCS deteriorated from 12 to 6. Due to worsening level of consciousness and onset of respiratory failure, he was intubated and transferred to the intensive care unit (ICU). Initial blood tests showed lymphopaenia of 0.6 x 109/L (1.5-3.5 109/L), Hb 10.5g/dL (13.5 – 18g/dL), and CRP 59 mg/L (0.00 – 5.00mg/L).

It is typically caused by traumatic percutaneous inoculation of the genera Fonsecaea, Phialophora, and Cladophialophora.  The infection presents as painless lesions that develop slowly over years from the site of inoculation as verrucous nodules or plaques, gradually spreading centripetally by lymphatic or cutaneous dissemination. The disease is commonly found in rural tropical and subtropical areas and affects male agricultural workers. Important differential diagnoses include mycetoma, cutaneous tuberculosis, lepromatous leprosy, infections with atypical mycobacteria, cutaneous leishmaniasis, Kaposi's Sarcoma, and non-infectious causes such as squamous cell carcinoma, sarcoidosis, chronic eczema, and psoriasis. The diagnosis is made by direct microscopic detection of pathognomonic sclerotic cells in skin scrapings, which are brownish, round, thick-walled structures of 4 to 12 µm length. Treatment is challenging and effectiveness depends on the causative agent, the clinical form, and the severity of the lesions.\\nA 46-year-old Thai woman from Thailand presents with a 2-month history of recurrent and treatment-refractory cutaneous and subcutaneous abscesses, progressive lymphadenopathy, and weight loss. The symptoms started 6-8 weeks after her return from a family visit to northern Thailand. On examination, multiple cutaneous and subcutaneous abscesses and a generalized lymphadenopathy are noted. Laboratory findings show elevated systemic markers of inflammation. The clinical picture and laboratory findings are highly suspicious of a systemic infection, and differential diagnoses include histoplasmosis, mycobacterial infections (such as melioidosis), and autoimmune syndromes. Key findings to diagnose Histoplasmosis include fungal cells identified on histopathology of a lymph node biopsy, and the presence of Histoplasma capsulatum confirmed by PCR and culture.\\nGnathostomiasis is a zoonotic nematode infection caused by Gnathostoma spinigerum, acquired by eating raw or undercooked freshwater fish and crustaceans. It presents with migratory subcutaneous swellings, eosinophilia, and a serpiginous tract. Important differential diagnoses include Loa loa infection, sparganosis, strongyloidiasis, and fascioliasis. Diagnosis is confirmed by demonstration of the parasite microscopically or radiologically. Lumbar puncture and cranial imaging may be necessary for CNS disease. Treatment consists of albendazole and/or ivermectin, with adjunctive corticosteroids for CNS infection.\\n\\nCryptococcal meningitis primarily occurs in sub-Saharan Africa and parts of Asia where HIV prevalence is high. It typically presents with sub-acute headache, cranial nerve palsies, confusion, and impaired consciousness. Clinically, it is characterized by raised intracranial pressure and non-specific cerebrospinal fluid findings. Important differential diagnoses include tuberculous meningitis and partially treated bacterial meningitis. The diagnosis is confirmed by demonstrating the fungus in the cerebrospinal fluid using methods such as India Ink staining, cryptococcal antigen detection, or fungal culture. Treatment consists of three phases: induction, consolidation, and maintenance, using drugs such as amphotericin B, flucytosine, and fluconazole. In resource-limited settings, alternative treatment regimens may be used due to poor drug availability.\\nCystic echinococcosis (CE) is characterized by the development of cystic lesions in the liver or lungs due to the larval form of the Echinococcus granulosus tapeworm. The primary symptom is abdominal pain, but it may progress to biliary obstruction, bacterial infection, cyst rupture, or compression syndromes. The diagnosis is based on imaging, mainly ultrasound, and classification of disease activity. Treatment options include anthelmintic therapy, percutaneous intervention, surgery, or a 'watch and wait' approach, depending on the individual case, local resources, and disease activity. The key to effective management is early detection of complications and long-term follow-up to prevent recurrence.\\nTalaromycosis (penicilliosis) is a fungal infection that typically affects severely immunocompromised individuals, often those with HIV/AIDS. It presents with non-specific symptoms such as prolonged fever, fatigue, weight loss, and diarrhea, accompanied by clinical signs of lymphadenopathy, hepatosplenomegaly, and anemia. Generalized umbilicated papular skin lesions, often located on the face, chest, and extremities, are characteristic. Important differential diagnoses include cryptococcosis, histoplasmosis, talaromycosis, disseminated tuberculosis, and infections with atypical mycobacteria. Diagnosis is confirmed by identification of the fungus in clinical specimens, including blood, bronchoalveolar lavage fluid, or biopsies of skin, lymph nodes, or bone marrow, showing extracellular and intracellular yeasts with a transverse septum. Key diagnostic findings include a CD4 count below 100 cells/µL, and treatment is with intravenous amphotericin B followed by oral itraconazole, with secondary prophylaxis in HIV-infected patients.\\n\\nA 25-year-old HIV-positive Zambian woman presented with a new-onset seizure. There are focal cortical lesions on the right hemisphere without contrast enhancement restricted to the subcortical white matter, suggestive of progressive multifocal leukoencephalopathy (PML). Important differential diagnoses include tuberculoma, cerebral toxoplasmosis, cryptococcoma, brain abscess, and primary CNS lymphoma. Key findings that led to the diagnosis of PML include normal CSF examination apart from slightly raised protein levels, focal brain lesion as revealed by EEG and CT scan, and JC-virus DNA detection in the CSF. Confirmation of the diagnosis of PML was based on JC-virus DNA detection in the CSF. The patient was treated with antiretroviral therapy (ART) and carbamazepine for seizure management.\\nA 34-year-old HIV-positive woman from Malawi presented with slowly progressive half-sided weakness of the left arm and leg, localized to her brain. Focal brain lesions in HIV-infected individuals in tropical countries are broad, including HIV-related brain diseases such as cerebral toxoplasmosis, progressive multifocal leukoencephalopathy, CNS lymphoma, cryptococcoma, and CMV encephalitis. Cerebral TB, brain tumor, brain metastases, cerebral abscess, neurocysticercosis, neuroschistosomiasis, and Chagas' disease are also considered. The patient's clinical status worsened after ART initiation, consistent with immune reconstitution inflammatory syndrome (IRIS). A cerebral MRI showed multifocal T2 hyperintense lesions in the white matter, and a presumed diagnosis of PML was made. PML always occurs due to reactivation of the human JC polyomavirus, typically in immunosuppressed individuals, presenting with muscle weakness, sensory deficits, hemianopia, cognitive dysfunction, aphasia, and coordination and gait difficulties. Key findings to diagnose include a typical imaging pattern (hypodense on CT, hyperintense on T2-weighted MRI) without mass effect or contrast enhancement, and a history of immunosuppression\\nPaucibacillary leprosy primarily occurs in leprosy-endemic countries and typically presents with one or a few hypopigmented anaesthetic skin patches and thickened peripheral nerves. It is essential to consider the combination of a skin problem and signs of a neuropathy as a suspect for leprosy. Important differential diagnoses include various inflammatory or traumatic processes. Leprosy is diagnosed clinically, and the diagnosis is confirmed by skin biopsy and slit-skin smear. The diagnosis is also supported by the WHO categorization of leprosy according to the number of skin lesions, with paucibacillary leprosy being treated with rifampicin and dapsone once per month.\\n\\nA 34-year-old HIV-positive woman from Malawi presented with slowly progressive half-sided weakness of the left arm and leg, localized to her brain.

Clinically, it presents as a subacute illness with systemic symptoms such as weight loss, night sweats, and cough. Key CSF findings include clear appearance, lymphocytic predominance, high protein concentration, and low CSF to plasma-glucose ratio. Important differential diagnoses include bacterial, cryptococcal, and other forms of meningitis. Diagnosis is confirmed by detection of acid-fast bacilli in CSF, culture, or molecular methods such as PCR. Treatment involves isoniazid, rifampicin, ethambutol, and pyrazinamide, with corticosteroids to improve clinical outcomes.\\nAcute bacterial meningitis primarily occurs in individuals with immunocompromised status, such as HIV-positive patients, and presents with symptoms like high fever, rapid decline in consciousness, seizures, stiff neck, and altered mental status. Clinically, it is characterized by cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) analysis showing pleocytosis, increased protein, and decreased glucose. A lumbar puncture is necessary to obtain a diagnosis, and antibiotics should be administered as soon as possible.

              " '13': {'question': {'Text': \"A 56-year-old otherwise healthy Guatemalan male landscaper presented to the emergency room with complaints of worsening swelling and pain in his right lower extremity over the past two months, accompanied by multiple raised and indurated lesions at various stages of healing along the right posteriomedial calf. In 2018, the patient experienced a similar episode involving the right lower extremity, during which surgical debridement and primary closure by podiatry were performed. This was followed by a two-week course of trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole (TMP-SMX) and cefazolin, resulting in complete resolution of symptoms related to coexisting Nocardia spp., methicillin-susceptible Staphylococcus aureus (MSSA), and Streptococcus agalactiae group B infections as confirmed by blood and tissue cultures at that time. The physical exam during his current presentation revealed marked edema of the distal right lower extremity, multiple granulomatous foci, and two well-healed scars along the medial and lateral aspects of the calf, attributable to his previous surgical debridement from 2018 (Figure 1). He had full strength and sensation in the affected extremity without any discernible deficits. There were no signs indicative of a systemic infection, and the patient’s vital signs remained stable. A computed tomography (CT) scan was completed, showing superficial compartment edema of the posterior distal lower extremity, along with an irregular heterogenous collection in the posteriomedial calf (Figure 2). Given the uncertainty regarding deep compartment involvement and the high suspicion of a developing abscess due to a recurrent Nocardia spp. infection, the patient was subsequently taken to the operating room. The final surgical pathology from the biopsied lesions and muscle indicated small clusters of thin filiform bacteria, which stained positively for Gram and Ziehl-Neelsen, most consistent with an actinomycetoma.The initial diagnose include these disease: Mycetoma, Nocardia infection, Actinomycetoma, Streptococcus agalactiae infection, Staphylococcus aureus infection. and its relevant information: A creeping eruption characterized by a linear or serpiginous, slightly elevated, erythematous track that moves forward in an irregular pattern, primarily caused by cutaneous larva migrans (CLM) due to larvae of animal hookworms, especially Ancylostoma caninum, A. braziliense, and Uncinaria stenocephala. Key symptoms include intense itchy skin eruptions, usually on the feet or areas exposed to infested sand/soil. Diagnosis is made clinically and supported by travel history, and confirmed by the presence of pruritic papules and progressing erythematous tracks with variable speed, depending on the hookworm species. The diagnosis does not rely on skin biopsy, because the larva is always in advance of its track, and no reliable serological tests are available. Treatment of choice is ivermectin (200 μg/kg for 1-2 days), or albendazole 400mg twice daily for 3 days in case of ivermectin contraindication or unavailability. Differential diagnoses include infection with larvae of Strongyloides stercoralis (larva currens), Gnathostoma species, and Fasciola species, as well as migratory myiasis.\\nChromoblastomycosis is a chronic fungal infection of the skin and subcutaneous tissue, most commonly of hands, feet, and lower legs. It is typically caused by traumatic percutaneous inoculation of the genera Fonsecaea, Phialophora, and Cladophialophora.  The infection presents as painless lesions that develop slowly over years from the site of inoculation as verrucous nodules or plaques, gradually spreading centripetally by lymphatic or cutaneous dissemination. The disease is commonly found in rural tropical and subtropical areas and affects male agricultural workers. Important differential diagnoses include mycetoma, cutaneous tuberculosis, lepromatous leprosy, infections with atypical mycobacteria, cutaneous leishmaniasis, Kaposi's Sarcoma, and non-infectious causes such as squamous cell carcinoma, sarcoidosis, chronic eczema, and psoriasis. The diagnosis is made by direct microscopic detection of pathognomonic sclerotic cells in skin scrapings, which are brownish, round, thick-walled structures of 4 to 12 µm length. Treatment is challenging and effectiveness depends on the causative agent, the clinical form, and the severity of the lesions.\\nTalaromycosis (penicilliosis) is a fungal infection that typically affects severely immunocompromised individuals, often those with HIV/AIDS. It presents with non-specific symptoms such as prolonged fever, fatigue, weight loss, and diarrhea, accompanied by clinical signs of lymphadenopathy, hepatosplenomegaly, and anemia. Generalized umbilicated papular skin lesions, often located on the face, chest, and extremities, are characteristic. Important differential diagnoses include cryptococcosis, histoplasmosis, talaromycosis, disseminated tuberculosis, and infections with atypical mycobacteria. Diagnosis is confirmed by identification of the fungus in clinical specimens, including blood, bronchoalveolar lavage fluid, or biopsies of skin, lymph nodes, or bone marrow, showing extracellular and intracellular yeasts with a transverse septum. Key diagnostic findings include a CD4 count below 100 cells/µL, and treatment is with intravenous amphotericin B followed by oral itraconazole, with secondary prophylaxis in HIV-infected patients.\\n\\nNoma is primarily encountered in the poorest children in developing countries, often with compromised immunity from malnutrition and vitamin deficiencies. Its symptoms begin with a sore on the face and bad breath, quickly advancing to a gangrenous lesion that can destroy tissue, with cases reported having a high case fatality rate of 70-90%. The diagnosis is primarily clinical, with other diseases such as malaria, measles, and oral cancer being unlikely causes. A confirmed diagnosis is not feasible with any diagnostic lab tests, hence it is crucial for a health worker to recognize noma based on symptoms and take action as it is treatable with antibiotics, nutritional support, and surgery. Other complications from the disease should also be looked for and treated in conjunction with the ongoing care.\\nPericardial tamponade caused by tuberculosis is a common condition in Africa, characterized by symptoms of right heart failure and cardiac decompensation. Clinically, it presents with signs such as tachycardia, pulsus paradoxus, hypotension, impalpable apex beat, raised jugular venous pressure, and quiet heart sounds. The diagnosis is suspected based on clinical presentation and further confirmed by ultrasound of the heart showing pericardial fluid, often blood-stained. The most common cause in Africa is tuberculosis, frequently associated with HIV infection, requiring prompt antituberculous treatment with corticosteroids. The diagnosis and management also involve HIV testing, antiretroviral therapy, and timely initiation of antituberculous treatment. Key findings to diagnose this disease include ultrasonography showing pericardial effusion, preferably confirmed by Xpert MTB/RIF assay. The most important differential diagnosis is other conditions causing pericardial effusion, such as bacterial infections, malignancy, and heart failure. The diagnosis is confirmed by laboratory evaluation, including ultrasonography and, if available, Xpert MTB/RIF assay, which can provide a confirmed diagnosis of TB within 2 hours.\\nInvasive non-typhoidal Salmonellae (iNTS) infection primarily presents with non-specific febrile illness, abdominal pain or history of diarrhea, mild splenomegaly, and severe anaemia. Clinically, it is characterized by aseptic fever, weight loss, and progressive weakness, with some patients reporting abdominal pain or history of diarrhea. Important differential diagnoses include typhoid and paratyphoid, malaria, and tuberculosis. The diagnosis is confirmed by detection of Salmonella enterica var Typhimurium in blood cultures, supported by relevant clinical presentation and epidemiological context. Severe anaemia is common and should prompt the clinician to look carefully for signs of TB co-infection.\\n\\nChromoblastomycosis is a chronic fungal infection of the skin and subcutaneous tissue, most commonly of hands, feet, and lower legs. It is typically caused by traumatic percutaneous inoculation of the genera Fonsecaea, Phialophora, and Cladophialophora.

Key findings to diagnose this exact disease include CSF analysis, blood cultures, and Gram stain. Differential diagnoses include malaria, enteric fever, dengue fever, and melioidosis.\\nBartonellosis, caused by B. bacilliformis, is a vector-borne disease mainly found in the Andean valleys of Peru, transmitted by female sandflies. The disease is characterized by a severe haemolytic anaemia with jaundice, high fever, malaise, myalgias, and CNS involvement. It progresses to a chronic angioproliferative cutaneous stage ('verruga peruana') in approximately 5% of treated patients and an unknown percentage of untreated individuals. Diagnosis is made by proof of cocco-bacilli inside red blood cells, while treatment of the acute phase includes ciprofloxacin alone or combined with ceftriaxone in severe cases. The differential diagnoses include malaria and bartonellosis, as well as several non-infectious causes of haemolysis.\\nFascioliasis, a serious public health problem, primarily affects people in the Andean countries, including Peru, caused by ingestion of metacercariae-contaminated watercress or drinking water. The disease includes four clinical phases and typically presents with intermittent fever, abdominal pain, malaise, weight loss, urticaria, and eosinophilia in the acute phase, while ova appear in the stool in the latent phase. Important differential diagnoses include pyogenic liver abscesses, amoebic liver abscess, brucellosis, visceral toxocariasis, and secondary infections.

A lumbar puncture is necessary to obtain a diagnosis, and antibiotics should be administered as soon as possible. Important differential diagnoses include tuberculous meningitis, cryptococcal meningitis, and other bacterial causes like Streptococcus pneumoniae and Neisseria meningitidis.\\nA 34-year-old HIV-positive woman from Malawi presented with slowly progressive half-sided weakness of the left arm and leg, localized to her brain. Focal brain lesions in HIV-infected individuals in tropical countries are broad, including HIV-related brain diseases such as cerebral toxoplasmosis, progressive multifocal leukoencephalopathy, CNS lymphoma, cryptococcoma, and CMV encephalitis. Cerebral TB, brain tumor, brain metastases, cerebral abscess, neurocysticercosis, neuroschistosomiasis, and Chagas' disease are also considered. The patient's clinical status worsened after ART initiation, consistent with immune reconstitution inflammatory syndrome (IRIS). A cerebral MRI showed multifocal T2 hyperintense lesions in the white matter, and a presumed diagnosis of PML was made. PML always occurs due to reactivation of the human JC polyomavirus, typically in immunosuppressed individuals, presenting with muscle weakness, sensory deficits, hemianopia, cognitive dysfunction, aphasia, and coordination and gait difficulties. Key findings to diagnose include a typical imaging pattern (hypodense on CT, hyperintense on T2-weighted MRI) without mass effect or contrast enhancement, and a history of immunosuppression\\n\\nStevens–Johnson syndrome (SJS) is characterized by a life-threatening mucocutaneous hypersensitivity reaction, most commonly caused by drugs. Clinical presentation includes a generalized, non-itchy maculopapular rash, conjunctivitis, painful skin and mucosal lesions, and potentially involvement of the oral mucosa, lips, and urogenital mucosa. The diagnosis is clinical, supported by ruling out major differential diagnoses such as staphylococcal scalded skin syndrome, toxic shock syndrome, and autoimmune bullous diseases. All potentially causative drugs should be withdrawn immediately. The main treatment is supportive, with management of fluids and electrolytes, careful nutrition, and pain control.\\nAcute transverse myelitis is a rare inflammatory condition of the spinal cord characterized by acute or sub-acute onset, presenting with back pain, flaccid paraplegia, sensory level on the trunk, and urinary incontinence. The main differential diagnosis includes autoimmune inflammation, viral infections, and systemic autoimmune disorders. CSF findings of increased lymphocytes and elevated protein level suggest inflammation in the spinal cord. Diagnosis is often idiopathic, but it can be associated with infections and autoimmune disorders. Treatment is empirical and includes high doses of corticosteroids, and acyclovir if HSV or VZV myelitis is suspected. Most patients remain disabled with flaccid paraparesis/paraplegia and incontinence.\\nInvasive non-typhoidal Salmonellae (iNTS) infection primarily presents with non-specific febrile illness, abdominal pain or history of diarrhea, mild splenomegaly, and severe anaemia. Clinically, it is characterized by aseptic fever, weight loss, and progressive weakness, with some patients reporting abdominal pain or history of diarrhea. Important differential diagnoses include typhoid and paratyphoid, malaria, and tuberculosis. The diagnosis is confirmed by detection of Salmonella enterica var Typhimurium in blood cultures, supported by relevant clinical presentation and epidemiological context. Severe anaemia is common and should prompt the clinician to look carefully for signs of TB co-infection.\\n\\nCryptococcal meningitis primarily occurs in sub-Saharan Africa and parts of Asia where HIV prevalence is high. It typically presents with sub-acute headache, cranial nerve palsies, confusion, and impaired consciousness. Clinically, it is characterized by raised intracranial pressure and non-specific cerebrospinal fluid findings. Important differential diagnoses include tuberculous meningitis and partially treated bacterial meningitis. The diagnosis is confirmed by demonstrating the fungus in the cerebrospinal fluid using methods such as India Ink staining, cryptococcal antigen detection, or fungal culture. Treatment consists of three phases: induction, consolidation, and maintenance, using drugs such as amphotericin B, flucytosine, and fluconazole. In resource-limited settings, alternative treatment regimens may be used due to poor drug availability.\\nCystic echinococcosis (CE) is characterized by the development of cystic lesions in the liver or lungs due to the larval form of the Echinococcus granulosus tapeworm. The primary symptom is abdominal pain, but it may progress to biliary obstruction, bacterial infection, cyst rupture, or compression syndromes. The diagnosis is based on imaging, mainly ultrasound, and classification of disease activity. Treatment options include anthelmintic therapy, percutaneous intervention, surgery, or a 'watch and wait' approach, depending on the individual case, local resources, and disease activity. The key to effective management is early detection of complications and long-term follow-up to prevent recurrence.\\nChromoblastomycosis is a chronic fungal infection of the skin and subcutaneous tissue, most commonly of hands, feet, and lower legs. It is typically caused by traumatic percutaneous inoculation of the genera Fonsecaea, Phialophora, and Cladophialophora.  The infection presents as painless lesions that develop slowly over years from the site of inoculation as verrucous nodules or plaques, gradually spreading centripetally by lymphatic or cutaneous dissemination. The disease is commonly found in rural tropical and subtropical areas and affects male agricultural workers. Important differential diagnoses include mycetoma, cutaneous tuberculosis, lepromatous leprosy, infections with atypical mycobacteria, cutaneous leishmaniasis, Kaposi's Sarcoma, and non-infectious causes such as squamous cell carcinoma, sarcoidosis, chronic eczema, and psoriasis. The diagnosis is made by direct microscopic detection of pathognomonic sclerotic cells in skin scrapings, which are brownish, round, thick-walled structures of 4 to 12 µm length. Treatment is challenging and effectiveness depends on the causative agent, the clinical form, and the severity of the lesions.\\n\\nSpinal tuberculosis is a common cause of tuberculous paraplegia and represents two-thirds of cases. It is characterized by focal areas of erosions and osseous destruction in the anterior corners of the vertebral bodies, involvement of the adjacent disc or vertebral body, 'wedging,' gibbus deformity or paraspinal abscess formation. Compressive spinal cord involvement is a common complication caused by accumulation of epidural caseous debris or by vertebral collapse or dislocation. Diagnosis is confirmed by CT-guided percutaneous vertebral or paravertebral biopsy and aspiration. The diagnosis involves the same antituberculous therapy as for pulmonary TB. The progression of bone destruction continues for up to 1 year after the effective antituberculous treatment has been initiated and should not be taken as a sign of treatment failure. Important differential diagnoses include spinal metastases, degenerative spinal disease, slipped disc, schistosomiasis, autoimmune transverse myelitis, and HIV-associated vacuolar myelopathy. The diagnosis of spinal tuberculosis is confirmed by detection of Mycobacterium tuberculosis using PCR-based technology such as GeneXpert from biopsied tissue, supported by relevant spinal radiography and clinical presentation.\\nTuberculous meningitis primarily occurs in settings with high tuberculosis prevalence and is characterized by florid gelatinous exudate in the subarachnoid space, causing symptoms such as fever, headache, cranial nerve palsies, and altered consciousness. Clinically, it presents as a subacute illness with systemic symptoms such as weight loss, night sweats, and cough. Key CSF findings include clear appearance, lymphocytic predominance, high protein concentration, and low CSF to plasma-glucose ratio. Important differential diagnoses include bacterial, cryptococcal, and other forms of meningitis. Diagnosis is confirmed by detection of acid-fast bacilli in CSF, culture, or molecular methods such as PCR. Treatment involves isoniazid, rifampicin, ethambutol, and pyrazinamide, with corticosteroids to improve clinical outcomes.\\nMycobacterium ulcerans disease, commonly known as Buruli ulcer, primarily occurs in West Africa, mainly in children and adolescents, and presents with skin lesions ranging from papules, nodules, and plaques to ulcers. The lesions are typically painless but may be painful, and they can involve most of a limb surface or trunk, sometimes occurring at different body sites. Key findings for diagnosis include a history of living in an endemic area, particularly near water bodies such as rivers and lakes, and the presence of skin lesions showing skin alterations like induration, hypo- and hyperpigmentation, lichenification, desquamation, and possibly local edema. Important differential diagnoses include traumatic, infectious, and neoplastic causes of ulcers. The diagnosis is confirmed by PCR from a wound swab, and treatment involves combination therapy with rifampicin, streptomycin, or clarithromycin for eight weeks, along with local heat application, wound care, pain relief, surgical excision, and skin grafting, as well as physiotherapy for restricted movements.\\n\\n\",\n",

Clinically, it presents as a subacute illness with systemic symptoms such as weight loss, night sweats, and cough. Key CSF findings include clear appearance, lymphocytic predominance, high protein concentration, and low CSF to plasma-glucose ratio. Important differential diagnoses include bacterial, cryptococcal, and other forms of meningitis. Diagnosis is confirmed by detection of acid-fast bacilli in CSF, culture, or molecular methods such as PCR. Treatment involves isoniazid, rifampicin, ethambutol, and pyrazinamide, with corticosteroids to improve clinical outcomes.\\nCryptococcal meningitis primarily occurs in sub-Saharan Africa and parts of Asia where HIV prevalence is high. It typically presents with sub-acute headache, cranial nerve palsies, confusion, and impaired consciousness. Clinically, it is characterized by raised intracranial pressure and non-specific cerebrospinal fluid findings. Important differential diagnoses include tuberculous meningitis and partially treated bacterial meningitis. The diagnosis is confirmed by demonstrating the fungus in the cerebrospinal fluid using methods such as India Ink staining, cryptococcal antigen detection, or fungal culture. Treatment consists of three phases: induction, consolidation, and maintenance, using drugs such as amphotericin B, flucytosine, and fluconazole. In resource-limited settings, alternative treatment regimens may be used due to poor drug availability.\\n\\nNeurocysticercosis presents with symptoms of focal epileptic seizures, with most common presentation being symptoms of 'pins and needles' sensation in a part of the body. It's caused by neurocysticercosis caused by the pork tapeworm Taenia solium, acquired after consuming food contaminated with T. solium eggs, which release oncospheres that infect the brain and form encysted larvae. Key findings to diagnose include neuroimaging showing multiple cystic lesions, supported by clinical presentation of focal seizures. Differential diagnoses in the context include hydrocephalus, cerebral oedema, and meningitis. The diagnosis is confirmed by serological and epidemiological evidence. Treatment includes antiparasitic drugs like albendazole or a combination of albendazole and praziquantel, in addition to steroid therapy.\\nThe disease primarily affects individuals born and living in areas with poor sanitation services and uncorralled pigs, such as rural Guatemala. It typically presents with transitory ischemic attacks, manifesting as parenchymal calcified lesions, complex cystic structures in the subarachnoid space, and an old lacunar infarct. Subarachnoid neurocysticercosis, the most severe form, is probably caused by the host's inflammatory response, manifesting as meningitis, communicating hydrocephalus, focal neurological symptoms, and cerebrovascular disease. Important differential diagnoses include other forms of neurocysticercosis, such as parenchymal neurocysticercosis, and other diseases causing similar imaging findings. The diagnosis is confirmed by MRI and serology, specifically the immunoblot with a sensitivity of 98% and specificity of near 100%, showing a high burden of disease. Treatment involves dual therapy with albendazole and praziquantel, corticosteroids, and a careful taper to avoid complications. The duration of treatment is still controversial, but current guidelines recommend treating until resolution on neuroimaging.\\nRabies is a viral infection caused by the Lyssavirus genus, transmitted through the bite of infected mammals, with an incubation period of 20-90 days. The paralytic form of rabies initially presents with fever, paraesthesia in the bitten limb, followed by rapid progression to quadriparesis, particularly proximal muscle involvement. Clinically, it may mimic Guillain Barre syndrome, post-vaccination encephalomyelitis, and other conditions. Laboratory confirmation involves testing for rabies-specific antibodies in saliva, CSF, or serum, and detection of viral RNA by RT-PCR from saliva or nuchal skin biopsy. Important differential diagnoses include Guillain Barre syndrome, post-vaccination encephalomyelitis, and other conditions listed in Table 91.1. The diagnosis is confirmed by detection of rabies-specific antibodies in CSF and serum, or by antigen detection using direct fluorescent antibody (dFA) test or RT-PCR on brain tissue obtained post-mortem.\\n\\nCerebral malaria is a severe neurological complication of Plasmodium falciparum infection, primarily occurring in sub-Saharan Africa. It presents with coma, no neurological localizing signs, hepatosplenomegaly, and a positive malaria rapid diagnostic test. Key findings for diagnosis include retinal whitening, hemorrhages, or orange-white vessels with or without papilloedema on ophthalmoscopy. Important differential diagnoses include bacterial meningitis, viral encephalitis, intoxication, metabolic abnormalities, and non-convulsive status epilepticus. The diagnosis is confirmed by the presence of Plasmodium falciparum parasitemia and the absence of other causes of coma, with supportive findings of malarial retinopathy on ophthalmoscopy. The mainstay of therapy is antimalarials, intensive supportive care, and diagnosis and treatment of non-malarial contributors to illness.\\nCerebral sparganosis, a food-borne zoonosis, primarily occurs in Asian countries, particularly China, South Korea, Thailand, and Japan, and presents with symptoms suggestive of a space-occupying lesion, such as headache, confusion, seizures, paralysis, or palsies. Important differential diagnoses include brain tumours or metastases, neurocysticercosis, cerebral schistosomiasis, and paragonimiasis. Diagnosis is confirmed by dependant history taking and serological investigations, supplemented by neuroimaging, especially MRI, which often reveals the 'tunnel sign' with hypointensity in T1-weighted and hyperintensity in T2-weighted images. The most effective treatment is the removal of the sparganum from the brain. Praziquantel treatment may also be effective.\\nA 25-year-old HIV-positive Zambian woman presented with a new-onset seizure. There are focal cortical lesions on the right hemisphere without contrast enhancement restricted to the subcortical white matter, suggestive of progressive multifocal leukoencephalopathy (PML). Important differential diagnoses include tuberculoma, cerebral toxoplasmosis, cryptococcoma, brain abscess, and primary CNS lymphoma. Key findings that led to the diagnosis of PML include normal CSF examination apart from slightly raised protein levels, focal brain lesion as revealed by EEG and CT scan, and JC-virus DNA detection in the CSF. Confirmation of the diagnosis of PML was based on JC-virus DNA detection in the CSF. The patient was treated with antiretroviral therapy (ART) and carbamazepine for seizure management.\\n\\nAcute bacterial meningitis primarily occurs in individuals with immunocompromised status, such as HIV-positive patients, and presents with symptoms like high fever, rapid decline in consciousness, seizures, stiff neck, and altered mental status. Clinically, it is characterized by cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) analysis showing pleocytosis, increased protein, and decreased glucose. A lumbar puncture is necessary to obtain a diagnosis, and antibiotics should be administered as soon as possible. Important differential diagnoses include tuberculous meningitis, cryptococcal meningitis, and other bacterial causes like Streptococcus pneumoniae and Neisseria meningitidis.\\nCerebral sparganosis, a food-borne zoonosis, primarily occurs in Asian countries, particularly China, South Korea, Thailand, and Japan, and presents with symptoms suggestive of a space-occupying lesion, such as headache, confusion, seizures, paralysis, or palsies. Important differential diagnoses include brain tumours or metastases, neurocysticercosis, cerebral schistosomiasis, and paragonimiasis. Diagnosis is confirmed by dependant history taking and serological investigations, supplemented by neuroimaging, especially MRI, which often reveals the 'tunnel sign' with hypointensity in T1-weighted and hyperintensity in T2-weighted images. The most effective treatment is the removal of the sparganum from the brain. Praziquantel treatment may also be effective.\\nThe patient is a 55-year-old woman from Vietnam who presents with fever, headache, vomiting, confusion, and impaired consciousness. She has a petechial rash and purpuric non-blanching lesions on her trunk and leg. The patient has a history of type 2 diabetes and hypertension. The diagnosis is confirmed by lumbar puncture showing turbid cerebrospinal fluid with high neutrophil count, high protein, and low CSF glucose ratio. Blood cultures grow Streptococcus suis, sensitive to penicillin and ceftriaxone. The patient receives 12 days of antibiotic therapy and steroids, and responds to treatment but has residual bilateral hearing impairment. Key findings to diagnose this exact disease include CSF analysis, blood cultures, and Gram stain. Differential diagnoses include malaria, enteric fever, dengue fever, and melioidosis.\\n\\nThe patient is a 55-year-old woman from Vietnam who presents with fever, headache, vomiting, confusion, and impaired consciousness.

Focal brain lesions in HIV-infected individuals in tropical countries are broad, including HIV-related brain diseases such as cerebral toxoplasmosis, progressive multifocal leukoencephalopathy, CNS lymphoma, cryptococcoma, and CMV encephalitis. Cerebral TB, brain tumor, brain metastases, cerebral abscess, neurocysticercosis, neuroschistosomiasis, and Chagas' disease are also considered. The patient's clinical status worsened after ART initiation, consistent with immune reconstitution inflammatory syndrome (IRIS). A cerebral MRI showed multifocal T2 hyperintense lesions in the white matter, and a presumed diagnosis of PML was made. PML always occurs due to reactivation of the human JC polyomavirus, typically in immunosuppressed individuals, presenting with muscle weakness, sensory deficits, hemianopia, cognitive dysfunction, aphasia, and coordination and gait difficulties. Key findings to diagnose include a typical imaging pattern (hypodense on CT, hyperintense on T2-weighted MRI) without mass effect or contrast enhancement, and a history of immunosuppression\\nCerebral malaria is a severe neurological complication of Plasmodium falciparum infection, primarily occurring in sub-Saharan Africa. It presents with coma, no neurological localizing signs, hepatosplenomegaly, and a positive malaria rapid diagnostic test. Key findings for diagnosis include retinal whitening, hemorrhages, or orange-white vessels with or without papilloedema on ophthalmoscopy. Important differential diagnoses include bacterial meningitis, viral encephalitis, intoxication, metabolic abnormalities, and non-convulsive status epilepticus. The diagnosis is confirmed by the presence of Plasmodium falciparum parasitemia and the absence of other causes of coma, with supportive findings of malarial retinopathy on ophthalmoscopy. The mainstay of therapy is antimalarials, intensive supportive care, and diagnosis and treatment of non-malarial contributors to illness.\\n\\n\",\n",
