            "Text": "The first patient was a 33-year-old physician who had been working in Liberia since October 2013, during which time he had remained healthy while taking daily combination therapy with atovaquone and proguanil as prophylaxis against malaria. In April 2014, he and his team established an EVD care unit in Monrovia, and patients with confirmed EVD began arriving at this facility on June 11, 2014. On July 23, 2014, he awoke feeling febrile and fatigued; his oral temperature was 37.8\u00b0C. He reported his symptoms to colleagues and remained at home. Results on two rapid diagnostic tests for malaria (Standard Diagnostics) were negative. He started empirical malaria treatment with artemether and lumefantrine. Later that day, his oral temperature was 38.6\u00b0C, and nausea developed. He was tested for malaria by means of a rapid diagnostic test and for yellow fever, Lassa fever, and EBOV by means of semiquantitative real-time reverse-transcriptase\u2013polymerase-chain-reaction (RT-PCR) assays, all of which were performed at the Liberian National Reference Laboratory. The results for all the tests were negative.",

        "ground_truth": "Despite initially negative RT-PCR results, the patient had high-risk occupational exposure while working in an Ebola treatment unit in Liberia during an active outbreak and developed an acute febrile illness with systemic symptoms. Early testing for EBOV can be falsely negative because viral loads may be below the detection threshold in the first days of illness. The epidemiologic context and compatible clinical presentation strongly support Ebola virus disease over other tropical infections.",
        "answer": "The final diagnosis for this patient is likely to be malaria. The patient had been taking prophylaxis against malaria and had a history of working in Liberia, where malaria is common.

        "contexts": "Ebola virus disease primarily occurs in tropical rainforests in sub-Saharan Africa and typically presents with fever, headache, asthenia, myalgias, abdominal pain, nausea, vomiting, and diarrhoea, with conjunctival injection and subconjunctival haemorrhage. Clinical presentation can include non-specific symptoms and rapidly progress to haemorrhage, multiple organ dysfunction, and shock. Important differential diagnoses include malaria, typhoid fever, bacterial gastroenteritis, and leptospirosis. The diagnosis is confirmed by detection of Ebola virus using ELISA antigen and PCR tests from blood or other body fluids, supported by relevant epidemiological exposure. The disease is caused by exposure to infected bat excreta or saliva, non-human primates, or person-to-person transmission in settings of inadequate universal precautions. Treatment is supportive, with antimalarials and broad-spectrum antibiotics given until the diagnosis of viral HF is confirmed.\nThe patient presents with a severe febrile illness, characterized by fever, sore throat, general body ache, retrosternal chest pain, abdominal symptoms, and conjunctivitis. Hypotension and shock are also present. Bilateral conjunctivitis and no rash or lymphadenopathy are notable findings. The patient's husband died of a similar illness recently, raising the suspicion of viral haemorrhagic fever, particularly Marburg virus disease or Ebola virus disease. Differential diagnoses include malaria, typhoid fever, bacterial sepsis, measles, Zika virus, and other viral infections. The diagnosis is confirmed by detection of Marburg virus RNA or Ebola virus RNA using PCR from blood or other body fluids, with a low parasitaemia of Plasmodium falciparum. Important findings include conjunctivitis, retrosternal chest pain, and abdominal symptoms, which are indicative of the viral haemorrhagic fever.\nDengue virus disease typically presents with high fever, headache, myalgia, and thrombocytopenia, with warning signs for severe disease including abdominal pain, vomiting, fluid accumulation, mucosal bleeding, lethargy or restlessness, and increasing haematocrit with concurrent worsening of thrombocytopenia. Clinically, it is characterized by rapid progression to shock and multi-organ dysfunction. Important differential diagnoses include scrub typhus, leptospirosis, and melioidosis. The diagnosis is confirmed by detection of the NS1 antigen by RDTs or ELISA, detection of viral RNA using RT-PCR, or paired serology tests for IgM/IgG demonstrating seroconversion.\n\nCerebral malaria is a severe neurological complication of Plasmodium falciparum infection, primarily occurring in sub-Saharan Africa. It presents with coma, no neurological localizing signs, hepatosplenomegaly, and a positive malaria rapid diagnostic test. Key findings for diagnosis include retinal whitening, hemorrhages, or orange-white vessels with or without papilloedema on ophthalmoscopy. Important differential diagnoses include bacterial meningitis, viral encephalitis, intoxication, metabolic abnormalities, and non-convulsive status epilepticus. The diagnosis is confirmed by the presence of Plasmodium falciparum parasitemia and the absence of other causes of coma, with supportive findings of malarial retinopathy on ophthalmoscopy. The mainstay of therapy is antimalarials, intensive supportive care, and diagnosis and treatment of non-malarial contributors to illness.\nKnowlesi malaria primarily presents with fever, thrombocytopenia, and non-specific arthralgias, and is characterized by a quotidian (daily) fever pattern with relatively high parasitaemias. The differential diagnosis includes dengue fever, chikungunya, Zika, influenza, acute HIV infection, enteric fever, and non-falciparum malaria, especially given the negative rapid diagnostic test for malaria. Diagnosis is confirmed by microscopy or PCR-based methods that distinguish *P. knowlesi* from other *Plasmodium species*, and treatment is the same as for acute falciparum malaria.\nA 32-year-old woman from Nigeria presents with fever, jaundice, and confusion 18 days after returning from a visit to rural Nigeria. The most common cause of fever and jaundice in West Africa is severe falciparum malaria. A malaria blood film is crucial to confirm the diagnosis, and the patient should be treated as malaria and other tests taken with standard universal precautions. Severe malaria is a life-threatening infection in non-immune patients and should be on the list of differential diagnoses for any unwell patient from the tropics. Early diagnosis and effective antimalarial drugs are key to malaria management.\n\nThis patient presents with an acute febrile illness that produces liver failure characterized by fever, jaundice, bleeding, encephalopathy, and seizures. Key findings include elevated liver transaminases, jaundice, spontaneous bleeding, and low hematocrit. The differential diagnosis includes viral hepatitis, malaria, dengue fever, leptospirosis, and severe yellow fever. Important laboratory tests for diagnosis include serial thick blood smears, dengue NS1 and IgM, blood cultures, PCR for leptospirosis, and IgM antibodies for viral hepatitis. The patient eventually died of yellow fever, as confirmed by highly positive IgM capture ELISA.\nThe patient presents with a severe febrile illness, characterized by fever, sore throat, general body ache, retrosternal chest pain, abdominal symptoms, and conjunctivitis.

Early diagnosis and effective antimalarial drugs are key to malaria management.\n\nLassa fever is common in sub-Saharan West Africa and is thought to infect approximately 300,000 people annually. The symptoms include fever, body aches, weakness, sore throat, retrosternal chest pain, abdominal pain, diarrhea, vomiting, cough, and breathlessness, with conjunctivitis often occurring late in the disease. The disease is more severe in pregnant women, and its severity is marked by raised liver transaminases. Clinically, it is characterized by a high case fatality rate in hospitalized patients, with a particularly high case fatality rate in the third trimester of pregnancy. The diagnosis is confirmed by antigen testing, PCR, or serological tests, with the treatment being with IV ribavirin, most effective when given early in the disease. Important differential diagnoses include adenovirus infections, measles, Mycoplasma pneumoniae, Leptospirosis, and typhoid fever.\nLoiasis, the symptomatic infection with the filarial nematode L. loa, primarily occurs in West and Central Africa. It presents with urticaria and transient painless subcutaneous swellings ('Calabar swellings'), a localized angioedema which may last from several hours to a few days. Adult worms may be spotted when migrating through the bulbar conjunctiva, causing intense itching, pain, and photophobia. Renal complications, such as glomerulonephritis and nephrotic syndrome, and a wide range of neurological symptoms have also been observed. The female worms release sheathed microfilariae detectable in the peripheral blood during daytime. Laboratory diagnosis relies on detecting microfilariae in a thick blood film or filtered blood, or using PCR (polymerase chain reaction) in amicrofilaraemic patients. Serology is not reliable due to cross-reactions with antibodies against other nematodes. Treatment with diethylcarbamazine (DEC), ivermectin, and albendazole may have severe side effects in patients with high levels of microfilariae, so sequential treatment is suggested based on the degree of microfilaraemia.\nThis patient presents with an acute febrile illness that produces liver failure characterized by fever, jaundice, bleeding, encephalopathy, and seizures. Key findings include elevated liver transaminases, jaundice, spontaneous bleeding, and low hematocrit.

The diagnosis is confirmed by detection of the NS1 antigen by RDTs or ELISA, detection of viral RNA using RT-PCR, or paired serology tests for IgM/IgG demonstrating seroconversion.\nThe disease primarily occurs in hot spots around the world, including Eastern Europe, the Middle East, Central and South Asia, Central and South America, and Africa. The patient initially presents with non-specific symptoms such as fever, sweating, fatigue, weight loss, headache, and joint pain, which persisted for weeks or months. The disease may involve nearly every organ of the body, and endocarditis is a less common but serious manifestation. A definitive diagnosis requires the isolation of the bacteria from the blood, body fluids, or tissues, which can be challenging as culture may take several weeks. Importantly, brucellosis should be considered in differential diagnosis in geographical regions where malaria and tuberculosis are highly prevalent and diagnostic resources are scarce, such as in sub-Saharan Africa.\nThis patient presents with an acute febrile illness that produces liver failure characterized by fever, jaundice, bleeding, encephalopathy, and seizures.

It typically presents with nonspecific symptoms such as fever, headache, dry cough, and abdominal pain. The fever starts insidiously and may be afebrile in the morning, with constipation being common and foul-smelling diarrhea occurring in the course of an untreated infection. The diagnosis is confirmed by proof of S. Typhi in blood cultures or bone marrow, while stool or urine isolation indicates a carrier state. Empirical antibiotic therapy should be started promptly, with fluoroquinolones being the drugs of choice in areas without antimicrobial resistance. The case fatality rate on antibiotic treatment is less than 1%, and targeted vaccination of high-risk populations seems to be a promising strategy to control the disease. Important differential diagnoses include malaria and invasive nontyphoidal salmonellae (iNTS) infections in HIV-positive patients. The diagnosis and treatment of enteric fever are crucial in areas where the disease is endemic due to high morbidity and mortality rates.\nScrub typhus is a common cause of pyrexia in large parts of Asia and northern Australia, transmitted by the bite of an infected larva (chigger) of a trombiculid mite. It presents with fever, severe headache, myalgia, regional or generalized lymphadenopathy, and a macular or maculopapular rash. CNS involvement is common, with presentations of diffuse encephalopathy or reversible sensorineural deafness. Diagnostic challenges require clinical suspicion and empirical antibiotic treatment. Serological tests, rapid diagnostic tests, ELISA, PCR, and culture are available for diagnosis. Standard treatment is with doxycycline 100 mg bid for 1 week.\nInvasive non-typhoidal Salmonellae (iNTS) infection primarily presents with non-specific febrile illness, abdominal pain or history of diarrhea, mild splenomegaly, and severe anaemia. Clinically, it is characterized by aseptic fever, weight loss, and progressive weakness, with some patients reporting abdominal pain or history of diarrhea. Important differential diagnoses include typhoid and paratyphoid, malaria, and tuberculosis. The diagnosis is confirmed by detection of Salmonella enterica var Typhimurium in blood cultures, supported by relevant clinical presentation and epidemiological context. Severe anaemia is common and should prompt the clinician to look carefully for signs of TB co-infection.\n\nInvasive non-typhoidal Salmonellae (iNTS) infection primarily presents with non-specific febrile illness, abdominal pain or history of diarrhea, mild splenomegaly, and severe anaemia.

Spondylitis, like in this case, is an osteoarticular complication occurring in up to 40% of cases and requires a prolonged treatment course of at least 12 weeks to avoid relapse. Diagnosis is challenging due to seroconversion in areas of high endemicity but tissue culture remains the gold standard for localized infection. Key findings for diagnosis include Brucella culture from blood or tissue samples, MRI showing spondylodiscitis with involvement of the psoas muscle, and raised CRP and ESR levels.\n\nThis patient presents with an acute febrile illness that produces liver failure characterized by fever, jaundice, bleeding, encephalopathy, and seizures. Key findings include elevated liver transaminases, jaundice, spontaneous bleeding, and low hematocrit. The differential diagnosis includes viral hepatitis, malaria, dengue fever, leptospirosis, and severe yellow fever. Important laboratory tests for diagnosis include serial thick blood smears, dengue NS1 and IgM, blood cultures, PCR for leptospirosis, and IgM antibodies for viral hepatitis. The patient eventually died of yellow fever, as confirmed by highly positive IgM capture ELISA.\nHantavirus Cardiopulmonary Syndrome (HCPS) primarily occurs in the border region between Chile and Argentina, caused by Andesvirus (ANDV) transmission typically through inhalation of excreta from the long-tailed pygmy rice rat or in rare cases by human-to-human contact. The clinical presentation includes a non-specific prodromal phase followed by rapidly progressing respiratory failure, cardiogenic shock, pulmonary oedema, and potential haemorrhagic manifestations. Diagnosis is confirmed by RT-PCR from whole blood or by serology with the presence of specific IgM antibodies or at least a 4-fold increase in IgG titres in paired samples. Treatment is mainly supportive, and patients should be transferred to a tertiary intensive care unit for ECMO support if necessary. The case fatality rate in HCPS attributable to ANDV is 20% to 40%.\nAmoebic liver abscess occurs worldwide, primarily in tropical regions with poor sanitation. Clinical presentation includes fever, chills, right hypochondrial pain, anorexia, weight loss, and dry cough. Laboratory findings include leukocytosis, raised inflammatory parameters, and elevated alkaline phosphatase. Diagnosis is made by a combination of imaging studies, such as abdominal ultrasound, and serology. Treatment involves nitroimidazole antibiotics, followed by luminal amoebicides. Differential diagnosis includes pyogenic liver abscess, hepatoma, and other liver infections. Key findings for diagnosis include a solitary hypoechoic lesion with an irregular wall in the liver, and a thick, odourless, brownish fluid with bacterial and amoebic trophozoites.\n\n"

While there, the man tracked chimpanzees and gorillas, and visited the Marangambo Forest python cave. Fruit bats were flying in and out of the cave, but he was not touched, bitten, or scratched by the bats. Later, he ate goat stew containing intestine at a local hotel and swam in a local lake. No one fell ill during the trip. The man developed fever 12 days after visiting the python cave, 11 days after eating goat stew, and 10 days after lake swimming. Prior to travel, he was vaccinated against hepatitis A, polio, typhoid, and yellow fever. He took doxycycline as malaria prophylaxis, but admits to missing a couple of doses. At presentation, physical examination is normal except for a temperature of 40.1\u00b0C (104.2\u00b0F) and relative bradycardia (79 beats per minute). Based on his exposure history and the pulse-temperature dissociation, typhoid fever is diagnosed and ceftriaxone begun.

The worm was successfully removed during a surgical procedure under local anesthesia.",
        "contexts": "A creeping eruption characterized by a linear or serpiginous, slightly elevated, erythematous track that moves forward in an irregular pattern, primarily caused by cutaneous larva migrans (CLM) due to larvae of animal hookworms, especially Ancylostoma caninum, A. braziliense, and Uncinaria stenocephala. Key symptoms include intense itchy skin eruptions, usually on the feet or areas exposed to infested sand/soil. Diagnosis is made clinically and supported by travel history, and confirmed by the presence of pruritic papules and progressing erythematous tracks with variable speed, depending on the hookworm species. The diagnosis does not rely on skin biopsy, because the larva is always in advance of its track, and no reliable serological tests are available. Treatment of choice is ivermectin (200 \u03bcg/kg for 1-2 days), or albendazole 400mg twice daily for 3 days in case of ivermectin contraindication or unavailability. Differential diagnoses include infection with larvae of Strongyloides stercoralis (larva currens), Gnathostoma species, and Fasciola species, as well as migratory myiasis.\nStrongyloidiasis, a soil-transmitted nematode infection, typically occurring in tropical and subtropical regions, can lead to severe chronic diarrhoea, malabsorption, and wasting in immunocompromised patients. Clinically, it is characterized by non-specific gastrointestinal complaints and/or eosinophilia in immunocompetent individuals, but can present with hyperinfection syndrome in immunocompromised patients, characterized by massive larval multiplication, severe symptoms, and potentially fatal complications. Important differential diagnoses include other gastrointestinal parasitic infections such as intestinal protozoa. The diagnosis is confirmed by detection of larvae of S. stercoralis using the Baermann technique or other parasitological examinations from stool, respiratory secretions, or other body fluids, supported by relevant epidemiological exposure.\nGnathostomiasis is a zoonotic nematode infection caused by Gnathostoma spinigerum, acquired by eating raw or undercooked freshwater fish and crustaceans. It presents with migratory subcutaneous swellings, eosinophilia, and a serpiginous tract. Important differential diagnoses include Loa loa infection, sparganosis, strongyloidiasis, and fascioliasis. Diagnosis is confirmed by demonstration of the parasite microscopically or radiologically. Lumbar puncture and cranial imaging may be necessary for CNS disease. Treatment consists of albendazole and/or ivermectin, with adjunctive corticosteroids for CNS infection.\n\nMeasles is a highly contagious viral infection that occurs worldwide, caused by a paramyxovirus. It presents with fever, conjunctivitis, rhinitis, and cough, followed by a maculopapular rash, often with severe desquamation. Immunocompromised individuals may have atypical presentations, including 'white measles' or late complications like subacute sclerosing panencephalitis (SSPE). Key findings for diagnosis include the typical rash, maculopapular or morbilliform type, conjunctivitis, and cough. Differential diagnoses include other viral infections, such as rubella and enterovirus, and bacterial infections like scarlet fever and meningococcal disease. Confirmation is based on clinical presentation, vaccination history, and exclusion of other conditions. Supportive treatment, vitamin A supplementation, and isolation are essential in management.\nTrachoma is an infectious disease primarily affecting the eyes, caused by Chlamydia trachomatis, and leading to blindness if left untreated. It is most prevalent in poor rural communities, where there is scarcity of water, poor sanitation, and low socioeconomic status. The disease manifests with follicular inflammation of the conjunctiva, followed by scarring, trichiasis (in-turned eyelashes), and corneal opacity, leading to visual impairment or blindness. Clinical presentation includes painful, red, and watery eyes, accompanied by symptoms such as discharge, blurred vision, and lid scarring. The diagnosis is primarily based on clinical examination and signs, such as follicles on the tarsal conjunctiva, conjunctival scarring, limbal follicles or Herbert's pits, fibrovascular pannus, and trichiasis. The WHO recommends the SAFE strategy for control: Surgery for advanced cases, Antibiotic treatment with azithromycin, Facial cleanliness, and Environmental improvement. The disease requires a comprehensive approach, including public health measures, to prevent and treat it effectively.\nA 51-year-old female traveller returning from Central America presents with a generalized slightly pruritic maculopapular rash, conjunctivitis, peripheral painful oedema, and generalized lymphadenopathy. The clinical presentation is highly suggestive of an arboviral infection. The diagnosis is confirmed by detection of Zika virus RNA using RT-PCR and seroconversion of IgM and IgG antibodies in acute and convalescent serum samples. Differential diagnoses include dengue and chikungunya infections.\n\nMeasles is a highly contagious viral infection that occurs worldwide, caused by a paramyxovirus.

The disease is characterized by a triad of ocular changes, skin changes, and subcutaneous nodules. Typical clinical features include non-tender subcutaneous nodules, dermatitis, depigmentation of the skin, and ocular changes such as keratitis, iritis, and uveitis. The diagnosis is typically made based on clinical findings and supported by serological tests. The most important differential diagnoses to consider are other causes of skin changes and ocular changes such as scabies, yaws, leprosy, mycotic infections, and eczema. The key finding to diagnose onchocerciasis is the presence of subcutaneous nodules with microfilariae of Onchocerca volvulus, which can be detected by skin snips, slit-lamp examination, or nodulectomy. The diagnosis is confirmed by detection of antibodies to O. volvulus antigens through serological tests. Treatment typically involves multiple courses of ivermectin, with or without doxycycline, and is usually provided annually in mass treatment programs.\nMycobacterium ulcerans disease, commonly known as Buruli ulcer, primarily occurs in West Africa, mainly in children and adolescents, and presents with skin lesions ranging from papules, nodules, and plaques to ulcers. The lesions are typically painless but may be painful, and they can involve most of a limb surface or trunk, sometimes occurring at different body sites. Key findings for diagnosis include a history of living in an endemic area, particularly near water bodies such as rivers and lakes, and the presence of skin lesions showing skin alterations like induration, hypo- and hyperpigmentation, lichenification, desquamation, and possibly local edema. Important differential diagnoses include traumatic, infectious, and neoplastic causes of ulcers. The diagnosis is confirmed by PCR from a wound swab, and treatment involves combination therapy with rifampicin, streptomycin, or clarithromycin for eight weeks, along with local heat application, wound care, pain relief, surgical excision, and skin grafting, as well as physiotherapy for restricted movements.\n\nTrachoma is an infectious disease primarily affecting the eyes, caused by Chlamydia trachomatis, and leading to blindness if left untreated.

The disease requires a comprehensive approach, including public health measures, to prevent and treat it effectively.\nA 6-year-old boy from Malawi presented with a progressive painless proptosis of his left eye for 3 weeks, and his vision has not been impaired. The most likely diagnosis is Burkitt's lymphoma, especially given his age and the fact that he lives in a malaria-endemic area. The diagnosis was confirmed through a fine-needle aspirate (FNA) or biopsy, and other investigations included abdominal ultrasound scan, lumbar puncture, HIV antibody test, stool and urine microscopy, and cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) examination. The boy received four courses of chemotherapy and was pronounced cured after a year. It is essential to balance treatment intensity with supportive care and the child's nutritional status in resource-constrained settings.\nOnchocerciasis, also known as \"river blindness,\" primarily occurs in rural areas near rapidly flowing rivers, particularly in West and Central Africa. The disease is characterized by a triad of ocular changes, skin changes, and subcutaneous nodules.

The diagnosis is confirmed by detection of antibodies to O. volvulus antigens through serological tests. Treatment typically involves multiple courses of ivermectin, with or without doxycycline, and is usually provided annually in mass treatment programs.\n\nHyperreactive malarial splenomegaly (HMS) is a condition caused by an abnormal immune response to repeated infections with Plasmodium falciparum, P. malariae, or P. vivax, leading to massive splenomegaly and hypersplenism. The condition is more common in women than in men, mainly affects those between 20 and 40 years, and has a genetic background with ethnic and familial clustering. Symptoms include abdominal heaviness or discomfort, low-grade fever, anaemia, and bi- or pancytopenia. Diagnosis is primarily based on clinical findings and exclusion of other causes, and treatment involves lifelong antimalarial therapy in endemic settings, or a single treatment course for migrants living in non-endemic areas.\nHantavirus Cardiopulmonary Syndrome (HCPS) primarily occurs in the border region between Chile and Argentina, caused by Andesvirus (ANDV) transmission typically through inhalation of excreta from the long-tailed pygmy rice rat or in rare cases by human-to-human contact. The clinical presentation includes a non-specific prodromal phase followed by rapidly progressing respiratory failure, cardiogenic shock, pulmonary oedema, and potential haemorrhagic manifestations. Diagnosis is confirmed by RT-PCR from whole blood or by serology with the presence of specific IgM antibodies or at least a 4-fold increase in IgG titres in paired samples. Treatment is mainly supportive, and patients should be transferred to a tertiary intensive care unit for ECMO support if necessary. The case fatality rate in HCPS attributable to ANDV is 20% to 40%.\nThe patient presents with a severe febrile illness, characterized by fever, sore throat, general body ache, retrosternal chest pain, abdominal symptoms, and conjunctivitis. Hypotension and shock are also present. Bilateral conjunctivitis and no rash or lymphadenopathy are notable findings. The patient's husband died of a similar illness recently, raising the suspicion of viral haemorrhagic fever, particularly Marburg virus disease or Ebola virus disease. Differential diagnoses include malaria, typhoid fever, bacterial sepsis, measles, Zika virus, and other viral infections. The diagnosis is confirmed by detection of Marburg virus RNA or Ebola virus RNA using PCR from blood or other body fluids, with a low parasitaemia of Plasmodium falciparum. Important findings include conjunctivitis, retrosternal chest pain, and abdominal symptoms, which are indicative of the viral haemorrhagic fever.\n\n"

She felt numbness at the tip of her fingers and toes for 4 days, but denied contact with any chemicals. Thirty years ago, she spent a week at her father-in-law's house after he was diagnosed with leprosy. No other family members or relatives showed symptom. Skin examination revealed asymmetrical, multiple, discrete, poorly defined borders and hyperpigmented plaques with decreased sensation on her back, nose, and both cheeks, loss of the outer two-thirds of both eyebrows, and infiltrated plaques on both earlobes. Neurological examination revealed a decrease in sensation of pain and temperature at the tips of her fingers and toes. Other physical examinations and peripheral nerve findings were unremarkable. At this stage, the provisional diagnosis of the patient's illness was leprosy. We then obtained slit skin smears of both earlobes and plaques of the skin on her back.

The patient presented with hyperpigmented lesions on her back, numbness at the tips of her fingers and toes, and decreased sensation in her skin. The slit skin smears revealed the presence of acid-fast stained bacilli, confirming the diagnosis of leprosy.",
        "contexts": "Paucibacillary leprosy primarily occurs in leprosy-endemic countries and typically presents with one or a few hypopigmented anaesthetic skin patches and thickened peripheral nerves. It is essential to consider the combination of a skin problem and signs of a neuropathy as a suspect for leprosy. Important differential diagnoses include various inflammatory or traumatic processes. Leprosy is diagnosed clinically, and the diagnosis is confirmed by skin biopsy and slit-skin smear. The diagnosis is also supported by the WHO categorization of leprosy according to the number of skin lesions, with paucibacillary leprosy being treated with rifampicin and dapsone once per month.\nLeptospirosis is a zoonotic disease caused by pathogenic Leptospira species. The disease presents with a biphasic illness, initially non-specific symptoms such as fever, headache, and myalgias, followed by a second phase dominated by immune-mediated pathology. Classical presentation includes severe myalgias, subconjunctival hemorrhage, and jaundice. In severe cases, complications such as acute kidney injury, pulmonary involvement, and myocarditis may occur. Diagnosis is confirmed by PCR detection, MAT serology, or culture, and treatment involves antibiotics such as doxycycline, amoxicillin, or benzylpenicillin.\nNeurolathyrism is a preventable toxic myelopathy caused by excessive ingestion of the Lathyrus sativus grass pea, primarily occurring in drought- or monsoon-prone areas. The clinical presentation is an irreversible acute to subacute spastic paraparesis or quadriparesis without prominent sensory involvement, with bladder and bowel function maintained. The diagnosis is based on a history of prolonged heavy ingestion of grass peas, particularly among young, malnourished, physically exerted males, and exclusion of other myelopathies. Key findings for diagnosis include exposure to L. sativus, dose-dependent toxicity, and characteristic gait disturbance. The differential diagnosis may include HTLV-associated myelopathy (HAM), neurocassavism (konzo), and compressive, hereditary, infectious, and metabolic myelopathies. Management involves symptomatic treatment with anti-spastic drugs and physiotherapy, while prevention includes education on avoidance of L. sativus consumption and measures to reduce toxin burden.\n\nSpinal tuberculosis is a common cause of tuberculous paraplegia and represents two-thirds of cases. It is characterized by focal areas of erosions and osseous destruction in the anterior corners of the vertebral bodies, involvement of the adjacent disc or vertebral body, 'wedging,' gibbus deformity or paraspinal abscess formation. Compressive spinal cord involvement is a common complication caused by accumulation of epidural caseous debris or by vertebral collapse or dislocation. Diagnosis is confirmed by CT-guided percutaneous vertebral or paravertebral biopsy and aspiration. The diagnosis involves the same antituberculous therapy as for pulmonary TB. The progression of bone destruction continues for up to 1 year after the effective antituberculous treatment has been initiated and should not be taken as a sign of treatment failure. Important differential diagnoses include spinal metastases, degenerative spinal disease, slipped disc, schistosomiasis, autoimmune transverse myelitis, and HIV-associated vacuolar myelopathy. The diagnosis of spinal tuberculosis is confirmed by detection of Mycobacterium tuberculosis using PCR-based technology such as GeneXpert from biopsied tissue, supported by relevant spinal radiography and clinical presentation.\nTuberculous meningitis primarily occurs in settings with high tuberculosis prevalence and is characterized by florid gelatinous exudate in the subarachnoid space, causing symptoms such as fever, headache, cranial nerve palsies, and altered consciousness. Clinically, it presents as a subacute illness with systemic symptoms such as weight loss, night sweats, and cough. Key CSF findings include clear appearance, lymphocytic predominance, high protein concentration, and low CSF to plasma-glucose ratio. Important differential diagnoses include bacterial, cryptococcal, and other forms of meningitis. Diagnosis is confirmed by detection of acid-fast bacilli in CSF, culture, or molecular methods such as PCR. Treatment involves isoniazid, rifampicin, ethambutol, and pyrazinamide, with corticosteroids to improve clinical outcomes.\nA 32-year-old man from Malawi presents with a 6-week history of productive cough, chest pain, weight loss, fevers, night sweats, and a painfully swollen neck. He has been treated for acid-fast bacilli (AFB) sputum-negative pulmonary tuberculosis 12 years ago. The patient has a CD4 count of 95 cells/\u00b5L and is on antiretroviral therapy (ART) and co-trimoxazole prophylaxis. The patient initially presents with tuberculous lymphadenitis but later develops signs of superimposed bacterial lymphadenitis, possibly iatrogenic, with probable Staphylococcus aureus infection. Key differential diagnoses include atypical mycobacteria, non-adherence to TB treatment, malabsorption, and drug resistance. The diagnosis is confirmed by microbiological examination of the lymph node aspirate, FNA of a neck gland yields purulent material.\n\nSyphilis in pregnancy primarily affects pregnant women in sub-Saharan Africa, characterized by a generalized, non-itchy macular rash involving the palms of the hands, often with no other symptoms. Clinically, it can progress to congenital syphilis in the offspring, with manifestations including a generalized bullous rash, jaundice, hepatosplenomegaly, and other signs. Syphilis in pregnancy has a significant impact on pregnancy outcome, with serious consequences for both mother and baby. The diagnosis is confirmed by serological tests, including treponemal and non-treponemal tests. The treatment of choice for syphilis is intramuscular benzathine penicillin, and a single dose given before 28 weeks' gestation can prevent adverse outcomes. Important differential diagnoses include other sexually transmitted infections. The diagnosis is confirmed by detection of specific antibodies and confirmed with further lab tests, including a rapid plasma reagin (RPR) titre.\nYaws is a chronic infectious disease caused by Treponema pallidum subspecies pertenue, characterized by a primary lesion starting as a localized papule on the lower legs or face, which may develop into a large nodule that ulcerates. Secondary lesions include a variety of skin lesions, arthralgias, malaise, and osteoperiostitis. Diagnosis is based on serology, using both treponemal tests and non-treponemal tests like RPR. The treatment of choice is benzathine benzylpenicillin or azithromycin, with a four-fold fall in RPR titre over 6 months indicating cure. Important differential diagnoses include Haemophilus ducreyi infection and other bacteria, which may be identified using PCR.\nFascioliasis, a serious public health problem, primarily affects people in the Andean countries, including Peru, caused by ingestion of metacercariae-contaminated watercress or drinking water. The disease includes four clinical phases and typically presents with intermittent fever, abdominal pain, malaise, weight loss, urticaria, and eosinophilia in the acute phase, while ova appear in the stool in the latent phase. Important differential diagnoses include pyogenic liver abscesses, amoebic liver abscess, brucellosis, visceral toxocariasis, and secondary infections. Diagnosis is confirmed by serological methods, such as the Fas2 ELISA, and treatment with triclabendazole is effective in almost 90% of cases.\n\nKaposi's sarcoma primarily occurs in regions with high rates of HIV infection, particularly in sub-Saharan Africa.  It presents with skin lesions, often accompanied by facial swelling, cough, shortness of breath, and productive sputum. Important differential diagnoses include tuberculosis, which should always be considered and aggressively ruled out. Diagnosis of cutaneous disease is often made by clinical appearance, although biopsy is recommended. Endoscopic examination of the lung may be necessary to confirm pulmonary involvement. Confirmation of diagnosis is primarily based on detection of human herpesvirus-8 (HHV-8), with the help of relevant clinical presentation and imaging.\nA 34-year-old HIV-positive woman from Malawi presented with slowly progressive half-sided weakness of the left arm and leg, localized to her brain. Focal brain lesions in HIV-infected individuals in tropical countries are broad, including HIV-related brain diseases such as cerebral toxoplasmosis, progressive multifocal leukoencephalopathy, CNS lymphoma, cryptococcoma, and CMV encephalitis. Cerebral TB, brain tumor, brain metastases, cerebral abscess, neurocysticercosis, neuroschistosomiasis, and Chagas' disease are also considered. The patient's clinical status worsened after ART initiation, consistent with immune reconstitution inflammatory syndrome (IRIS). A cerebral MRI showed multifocal T2 hyperintense lesions in the white matter, and a presumed diagnosis of PML was made. PML always occurs due to reactivation of the human JC polyomavirus, typically in immunosuppressed individuals, presenting with muscle weakness, sensory deficits, hemianopia, cognitive dysfunction, aphasia, and coordination and gait difficulties. Key findings to diagnose include a typical imaging pattern (hypodense on CT, hyperintense on T2-weighted MRI) without mass effect or contrast enhancement, and a history of immunosuppression\nOcular surface squamous neoplasia (OSSN) is commonly seen in HIV-positive individuals in tropical regions, particularly in sub-Saharan Africa. The disease presents as a greyish, elevated, gelatinous mass surrounded by engorged conjunctival vessels, often starting on the nasal side of the eye and spreading to involve the whole conjunctiva, lids, local tissue, and lymph nodes. Differential diagnoses include pterygium, amelanotic naevus, lipoma, amelanotic melanomas, lymphomas, and adenocarcinomas. OSSN can be diagnosed using clinical examination with slit lamp, toluidine blue vital staining, and histopathological examination after surgical biopsy. Early stages can be treated with topical chemotherapy or subconjunctival interferon-\u03b12b, whereas primary treatment is surgical excision. HIV-infected patients with OSSN should receive effective antiretroviral therapy (ART) to achieve virological control.\n\nAfrican tick-bite fever primarily occurs in sub-Saharan Africa and is typically characterized by fever, flu-like symptoms, headache, and myalgias. A characteristic inoculation eschar at the site of the tick bite with local lymphadenopathy is often observed. Other possible diagnoses include malaria, and the diagnosis typically made clinically. PCR from the eschar scab or even a skin swab is useful for confirming the diagnosis. Differential diagnoses include malaria, scrub typhus, epidemic typhus, and murine typhus. The diagnosis is confirmed by PCR or serodiagnosis, and treatment is usually not necessary in mild cases, but doxycycline may be given to speed up recovery;\nAnthrax is a zoonotic disease caused by *B. anthracis*, primarily affecting herbivores. Humans are exposed through infected animals or contaminated animal products. The disease presents as cutaneous (95% of cases), with a painless central ulcer, vesicles, and extensive surrounding edema. Systemic symptoms include malaise and headache, while fever and leukocytosis may not be present. Important differential diagnoses include bacterial ecthyma, rickettsial diseases, rat-bite fevers, necrotic arachnidism, ulceroglandular tularaemia, and bubonic plague. The diagnosis is confirmed by detection of *B. anthracis* in blood, skin lesion aspirate, or pleural fluid through Gram stain and culture or PCR and IHC staining. Empirical antibacterial treatment with a quinolone or doxycycline is initiated while awaiting microbiological results.\nSickle cell disease is a hereditary disorder that primarily occurs in Africa and Asia and typically presents with chronic leg ulcers, particularly in areas with thin skin and little subcutaneous fat such as the ankles. Ulcers are slow to heal, painful, and characterized by unexplained relapses. Important differential diagnoses include tropical ulcer, diabetic ulcer, chronic osteomyelitis, and pyoderma gangrenosum. The diagnosis is confirmed by detection of HbS in red blood cells using a sickle slide, solubility test, or haemoglobin electrophoresis. Key findings include abnormal sickled red blood cells, polychromasia, target cells, nucleated red cells, and a high white cell count.\n\n"

Treatment typically involves multiple courses of ivermectin, with or without doxycycline, and is usually provided annually in mass treatment programs.\nMycobacterium ulcerans disease, commonly known as Buruli ulcer, primarily occurs in West Africa, mainly in children and adolescents, and presents with skin lesions ranging from papules, nodules, and plaques to ulcers. The lesions are typically painless but may be painful, and they can involve most of a limb surface or trunk, sometimes occurring at different body sites. Key findings for diagnosis include a history of living in an endemic area, particularly near water bodies such as rivers and lakes, and the presence of skin lesions showing skin alterations like induration, hypo- and hyperpigmentation, lichenification, desquamation, and possibly local edema. Important differential diagnoses include traumatic, infectious, and neoplastic causes of ulcers. The diagnosis is confirmed by PCR from a wound swab, and treatment involves combination therapy with rifampicin, streptomycin, or clarithromycin for eight weeks, along with local heat application, wound care, pain relief, surgical excision, and skin grafting, as well as physiotherapy for restricted movements.\n\nMycobacterium ulcerans disease, commonly known as Buruli ulcer, primarily occurs in West Africa, mainly in children and adolescents, and presents with skin lesions ranging from papules, nodules, and plaques to ulcers.

The disease is characterized by a triad of ocular changes, skin changes, and subcutaneous nodules. Typical clinical features include non-tender subcutaneous nodules, dermatitis, depigmentation of the skin, and ocular changes such as keratitis, iritis, and uveitis. The diagnosis is typically made based on clinical findings and supported by serological tests. The most important differential diagnoses to consider are other causes of skin changes and ocular changes such as scabies, yaws, leprosy, mycotic infections, and eczema. The key finding to diagnose onchocerciasis is the presence of subcutaneous nodules with microfilariae of Onchocerca volvulus, which can be detected by skin snips, slit-lamp examination, or nodulectomy. The diagnosis is confirmed by detection of antibodies to O. volvulus antigens through serological tests. Treatment typically involves multiple courses of ivermectin, with or without doxycycline, and is usually provided annually in mass treatment programs.\nA creeping eruption characterized by a linear or serpiginous, slightly elevated, erythematous track that moves forward in an irregular pattern, primarily caused by cutaneous larva migrans (CLM) due to larvae of animal hookworms, especially Ancylostoma caninum, A. braziliense, and Uncinaria stenocephala. Key symptoms include intense itchy skin eruptions, usually on the feet or areas exposed to infested sand/soil. Diagnosis is made clinically and supported by travel history, and confirmed by the presence of pruritic papules and progressing erythematous tracks with variable speed, depending on the hookworm species. The diagnosis does not rely on skin biopsy, because the larva is always in advance of its track, and no reliable serological tests are available. Treatment of choice is ivermectin (200 \u03bcg/kg for 1-2 days), or albendazole 400mg twice daily for 3 days in case of ivermectin contraindication or unavailability. Differential diagnoses include infection with larvae of Strongyloides stercoralis (larva currens), Gnathostoma species, and Fasciola species, as well as migratory myiasis.\n\nTrachoma is an infectious disease primarily affecting the eyes, caused by Chlamydia trachomatis, and leading to blindness if left untreated. It is most prevalent in poor rural communities, where there is scarcity of water, poor sanitation, and low socioeconomic status. The disease manifests with follicular inflammation of the conjunctiva, followed by scarring, trichiasis (in-turned eyelashes), and corneal opacity, leading to visual impairment or blindness. Clinical presentation includes painful, red, and watery eyes, accompanied by symptoms such as discharge, blurred vision, and lid scarring. The diagnosis is primarily based on clinical examination and signs, such as follicles on the tarsal conjunctiva, conjunctival scarring, limbal follicles or Herbert's pits, fibrovascular pannus, and trichiasis. The WHO recommends the SAFE strategy for control: Surgery for advanced cases, Antibiotic treatment with azithromycin, Facial cleanliness, and Environmental improvement. The disease requires a comprehensive approach, including public health measures, to prevent and treat it effectively.\nMeasles is a highly contagious viral infection that occurs worldwide, caused by a paramyxovirus. It presents with fever, conjunctivitis, rhinitis, and cough, followed by a maculopapular rash, often with severe desquamation. Immunocompromised individuals may have atypical presentations, including 'white measles' or late complications like subacute sclerosing panencephalitis (SSPE). Key findings for diagnosis include the typical rash, maculopapular or morbilliform type, conjunctivitis, and cough. Differential diagnoses include other viral infections, such as rubella and enterovirus, and bacterial infections like scarlet fever and meningococcal disease. Confirmation is based on clinical presentation, vaccination history, and exclusion of other conditions. Supportive treatment, vitamin A supplementation, and isolation are essential in management.\nA 51-year-old female traveller returning from Central America presents with a generalized slightly pruritic maculopapular rash, conjunctivitis, peripheral painful oedema, and generalized lymphadenopathy. The clinical presentation is highly suggestive of an arboviral infection. The diagnosis is confirmed by detection of Zika virus RNA using RT-PCR and seroconversion of IgM and IgG antibodies in acute and convalescent serum samples. Differential diagnoses include dengue and chikungunya infections.\n\n"

            "Text": "We present the case of a 59-year-old female with a 30-year history of untreated type 2 diabetes. The patient arrived at the emergency room complaining of rib pain and a one-month evolution of generalized dermatosis, whereby she was hospitalized. An important precedent was the self-medicated use of topical corticosteroids for seven weeks to treat pruritus. On physical examination, the patient had a body mass index (BMI) of 16.4 kg/m2. Furthermore, multiple fissured hyperkeratotic lesions were observed, with a psoriasiform appearance, a yellowish-brown color, and a general distribution, although they mainly affected the hands and feet. In addition, scaly lesions were observed distributed on both elbows, the anterior neck, and the posterior region of the thorax. The keratotic plaques were firm and tender on palpation and were accompanied by pruritus. Direct scraping of the injured skin on the hand was performed with a number 10 scalpel blade, then the sample was placed on a slide and a drop of mineral oil was added (Muller's test). Microscopic analysis reveals the presence of an ovoid body similar to a turtle (idiosome), endowed with four pairs of short legs, revealing infestation by Sarcoptes scabiei, which confirmed the diagnostic suspicion of CS.",

        "ground_truth": "The patient\u2019s diffuse hyperkeratotic, fissured, psoriasiform plaques with intense pruritus, particularly involving the hands and feet, are characteristic of crusted scabies. Long-standing diabetes, low BMI, and prolonged topical corticosteroid use are predisposing factors for this severe form of scabies. Definitive diagnosis was confirmed by direct skin scraping demonstrating Sarcoptes scabie on microscopic examination.",
        "answer": "The final diagnosis for this patient is crusted scabies. The patient presented with a widespread, exfoliating rash involving the hands, feet, neck, face, scalp, axillae, trunk, buttocks, and limbs, accompanied by secondary bacterial infections. The diagnosis was confirmed by microscopy of skin scrapings under low-power magnification, revealing the presence of hyperkeratotic skin crusts, mites in skin lesions, and shedding of skin flakes onto bed linen and floors. The treatment typically involves topical scabicides, oral ivermectin, and keratolytic cream.",
        "contexts": "Crusted scabies primarily occurs in individuals with weakened immune systems, such as those with HIV, HTLV-1, immunosuppressive therapy, or certain medical conditions. It typically presents with a widespread, exfoliating rash, often involving the hands, feet, neck, face, scalp, axillae, trunk, buttocks, and limbs, often accompanied by secondary bacterial infections. Clinically, it is characterized by the presence of hyperkeratotic skin crusts, mites in skin lesions, and shedding of skin flakes onto bed linen and floors. Important differential diagnoses include psoriasis, tinea corporis, skin malignancies, nutritional deficiencies, onchocerciasis, lepromatous leprosy, and secondary syphilis. Diagnosis is confirmed by microscopy of skin scrapings under low-power magnification. The treatment typically involves topical scabicides, oral ivermectin, and keratolytic cream. Initial management includes oxygen therapy, fluid resuscitation, and antibiotic treatment for sepsis.\nTungiasis primarily occurs in Latin America, the Caribbean, and sub-Saharan Africa, typically presenting with a slowly growing node on the skin, often near the nail bed, surrounding inflammatory reaction, and sometimes itching or pain. Clinically, it is characterized by a pale nodule with a dark centre that can turn brown with a dark scab. Important differential diagnoses include scabies and other ectoparasitic infestations. The diagnosis is usually based on clinical presentation, but can be confirmed by demonstrating the parasite and its eggs in tissue samples and histopathological sections. Treatment consists of removing the flea with a sterile needle or curette, disinfection, and prevention or treatment of concomitant bacterial infections. Removal can be done with or without local anaesthesia and usually heals within a week without complications.\nKonzo is a tropical spastic paraparesis that predominantly occurs in cassava-growing areas in Africa, characterized by an abrupt onset of a permanent but non-progressive form of spastic paraparesis. It is related to cassava consumption, particularly high dietary exposure of cyanogenic glycosides from insufficiently processed cassava tubers. The clinical presentation includes symmetrical spastic paraparesis, absent sensory or genitourinary involvement, and typically an abrupt onset within 1 week. The diagnosis is based on these clinical criteria and exclusion of other causes. The main differential diagnoses include spinal tuberculosis, transverse myelitis, spinal cord infections, and tropical nutritional myeloneuropathies such as lathyrism. The diagnosis is primarily clinician-based, supported by nutritional history and epidemiological evidence.\n\nFascioliasis, a serious public health problem, primarily affects people in the Andean countries, including Peru, caused by ingestion of metacercariae-contaminated watercress or drinking water. The disease includes four clinical phases and typically presents with intermittent fever, abdominal pain, malaise, weight loss, urticaria, and eosinophilia in the acute phase, while ova appear in the stool in the latent phase. Important differential diagnoses include pyogenic liver abscesses, amoebic liver abscess, brucellosis, visceral toxocariasis, and secondary infections. Diagnosis is confirmed by serological methods, such as the Fas2 ELISA, and treatment with triclabendazole is effective in almost 90% of cases.\nTalaromycosis (penicilliosis) is a fungal infection that typically affects severely immunocompromised individuals, often those with HIV/AIDS. It presents with non-specific symptoms such as prolonged fever, fatigue, weight loss, and diarrhea, accompanied by clinical signs of lymphadenopathy, hepatosplenomegaly, and anemia. Generalized umbilicated papular skin lesions, often located on the face, chest, and extremities, are characteristic. Important differential diagnoses include cryptococcosis, histoplasmosis, talaromycosis, disseminated tuberculosis, and infections with atypical mycobacteria. Diagnosis is confirmed by identification of the fungus in clinical specimens, including blood, bronchoalveolar lavage fluid, or biopsies of skin, lymph nodes, or bone marrow, showing extracellular and intracellular yeasts with a transverse septum. Key diagnostic findings include a CD4 count below 100 cells/\u00b5L, and treatment is with intravenous amphotericin B followed by oral itraconazole, with secondary prophylaxis in HIV-infected patients.\nLoiasis, the symptomatic infection with the filarial nematode L. loa, primarily occurs in West and Central Africa. It presents with urticaria and transient painless subcutaneous swellings ('Calabar swellings'), a localized angioedema which may last from several hours to a few days. Adult worms may be spotted when migrating through the bulbar conjunctiva, causing intense itching, pain, and photophobia. Renal complications, such as glomerulonephritis and nephrotic syndrome, and a wide range of neurological symptoms have also been observed. The female worms release sheathed microfilariae detectable in the peripheral blood during daytime. Laboratory diagnosis relies on detecting microfilariae in a thick blood film or filtered blood, or using PCR (polymerase chain reaction) in amicrofilaraemic patients. Serology is not reliable due to cross-reactions with antibodies against other nematodes. Treatment with diethylcarbamazine (DEC), ivermectin, and albendazole may have severe side effects in patients with high levels of microfilariae, so sequential treatment is suggested based on the degree of microfilaraemia.\n\nCrusted scabies primarily occurs in individuals with weakened immune systems, such as those with HIV, HTLV-1, immunosuppressive therapy, or certain medical conditions. It typically presents with a widespread, exfoliating rash, often involving the hands, feet, neck, face, scalp, axillae, trunk, buttocks, and limbs, often accompanied by secondary bacterial infections.

Initial management includes oxygen therapy, fluid resuscitation, and antibiotic treatment for sepsis.\nThe patient is a 55-year-old woman from Vietnam who presents with fever, headache, vomiting, confusion, and impaired consciousness. She has a petechial rash and purpuric non-blanching lesions on her trunk and leg. The patient has a history of type 2 diabetes and hypertension. The diagnosis is confirmed by lumbar puncture showing turbid cerebrospinal fluid with high neutrophil count, high protein, and low CSF glucose ratio. Blood cultures grow Streptococcus suis, sensitive to penicillin and ceftriaxone. The patient receives 12 days of antibiotic therapy and steroids, and responds to treatment but has residual bilateral hearing impairment. Key findings to diagnose this exact disease include CSF analysis, blood cultures, and Gram stain. Differential diagnoses include malaria, enteric fever, dengue fever, and melioidosis.\nPellagra primarily occurs in central and southern Africa, where maize is the main staple food, due to its deficiency of vitamin B3 or its precursor, tryptophan. The patient presents with the three 'Ds' of dermatitis, diarrhoea, and dementia. Dermatitis often presents as 'Casal's necklace' around the neck, is dry, tender to touch, and exposure to sunlight may be painful. 'Dementia' stands for a large spectrum of possible neuropsychiatric symptoms. The diagnosis is made clinically. Important differential diagnoses include HIV infection, tuberculosis meningitis, cryptococcal meningitis, progressive multifocal leukoencephalopathy (PML), and systemic lupus erythematosus. The diagnosis is confirmed clinically. Treatment is with niacin or nicotinamide, usually in dosages ranging from 50 to 400mg daily. In severe cases, intravenous administration may be required.\n\n"

In 2013, adalimumab (one injection/15 days) plus methotrexate (10mg/week) was used due to poor progress. Since then, she has not required steroids and has remained asymptomatic with this therapeutic approach. She recently presented a mucocutaneous, erythematous and ulcerous lesion in the nasal vestibule and the upper lip that has deformed her nose (Fig. 1). For this reason, she was referred to the ENT department, where a biopsy was performed and the subsequent anatomopathological study was diagnostic of leishmaniasis, both by direct vision with the Giemsa technique and by nested polymerase chain reaction.

The patient had no history of travel to endemic areas or exposure to animals, and there was no record of a bite.",
        "contexts": "Cutaneous leishmaniasis typically occurs in areas where sand flies are present, such as the Andes in Peru. It presents as a localized painless ulcer with raised edges, often on exposed parts of the skin. The diagnosis is confirmed by demonstration of the parasite using microscopic examination, culture or molecular techniques. Differential diagnoses include sporotrichosis, cutaneous tuberculosis, and infection by Balamuthia mandrillaris. The treatment involves systemic therapy with first-line drugs such as pentavalent antimonials, and second-line drugs like Amphotericin B or liposomal Amphotericin B may be considered, especially for L. (V.) braziliensis infection.\nVisceral Leishmaniasis primarily occurs in East Africa and the Indian subcontinent, particularly in five countries (India, Sudan, South Sudan, Ethiopia, and Brazil). The clinical presentation includes chronic fever, fatigue, anorexia, weight loss, enlarged lymph nodes, splenomegaly, and hepatomegaly. It typically presents in 2-8 months after the sandfly bite. Laboratory results show pancytopenia, with depletion of all three cell lines in the FBC. A direct proof of the parasite is the classic confirmatory test for VL, but in low-resource settings, serological tests are often used instead, such as the rK39 immuno-chromatographic test (ICT), the Direct Agglutination Test (DAT), and semiquantitative DAT. The diagnosis is challenging due to variable sensitivity and specificity of these tests. The most important differential diagnoses include malaria, brucellosis, tuberculosis, HIV infection, typhoid fever, splenic abscess, chronic schistosomiasis, and malignancies. The key findings to diagnose this exact disease include a positive Direct Agglutination Test or semiquantitative DAT with a high titre, and demonstration of Leishmania amastigotes in samples from the bone marrow, spleen, and lymph node.\nLoiasis, the symptomatic infection with the filarial nematode L. loa, primarily occurs in West and Central Africa.

It primarily occurs in the rainforests of South America and the Caribbean. The clinical presentation of Mayaro infection is a dengue-like, febrile illness lasting 3-7 days, characterized by chills, headache, myalgia, arthralgia, nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, and a maculopapular rash. The disease may also cause debilitating and long-lasting polyarthralgias, which are suspected to arise from the inflammatory immune response stimulated by the prolonged virus persistence in joint tissues. The differential diagnosis includes reactive arthritis and viral arthritis, while the key finding to diagnose Mayaro virus infection is the detection of specific IgM and IgG antibodies against the virus using indirect immunofluorescence assay (IFA) and plaque reduction neutralization test (PRNT).\nRabies is a viral infection caused by the Lyssavirus genus, transmitted through the bite of infected mammals, with an incubation period of 20-90 days. The paralytic form of rabies initially presents with fever, paraesthesia in the bitten limb, followed by rapid progression to quadriparesis, particularly proximal muscle involvement. Clinically, it may mimic Guillain Barre syndrome, post-vaccination encephalomyelitis, and other conditions. Laboratory confirmation involves testing for rabies-specific antibodies in saliva, CSF, or serum, and detection of viral RNA by RT-PCR from saliva or nuchal skin biopsy. Important differential diagnoses include Guillain Barre syndrome, post-vaccination encephalomyelitis, and other conditions listed in Table 91.1. The diagnosis is confirmed by detection of rabies-specific antibodies in CSF and serum, or by antigen detection using direct fluorescent antibody (dFA) test or RT-PCR on brain tissue obtained post-mortem.\nAnthrax is a zoonotic disease caused by *B. anthracis*, primarily affecting herbivores. Humans are exposed through infected animals or contaminated animal products. The disease presents as cutaneous (95% of cases), with a painless central ulcer, vesicles, and extensive surrounding edema. Systemic symptoms include malaise and headache, while fever and leukocytosis may not be present. Important differential diagnoses include bacterial ecthyma, rickettsial diseases, rat-bite fevers, necrotic arachnidism, ulceroglandular tularaemia, and bubonic plague. The diagnosis is confirmed by detection of *B. anthracis* in blood, skin lesion aspirate, or pleural fluid through Gram stain and culture or PCR and IHC staining. Empirical antibacterial treatment with a quinolone or doxycycline is initiated while awaiting microbiological results.\n\nThe patient presented with anaphylactic shock and a circumscribed, painless swelling on the inside of his left ankle, which was initially attributed to a tick bite. However, the presence of fever, headache, puffy face, and an erythematous rash suggested trypanosomiasis. The diagnosis was confirmed by the presence of trypanosomes in a thick blood film, and the patient was treated with suramin. The rapid progression to neurological involvement was indicated by the presence of trypanosomes in the cerebrospinal fluid (CSF), and treatment was switched to melarsoprol. Key findings that led to the diagnosis of trypanosomiasis include the presence of trypanosomes in the blood and CSF, and the patient's exposure to tsetse flies in a national game park. Important differential diagnoses include hypersensitivity reactions, invasive helminthiasis, and rickettsial disease.\nNeurolathyrism is a preventable toxic myelopathy caused by excessive ingestion of the Lathyrus sativus grass pea, primarily occurring in drought- or monsoon-prone areas. The clinical presentation is an irreversible acute to subacute spastic paraparesis or quadriparesis without prominent sensory involvement, with bladder and bowel function maintained. The diagnosis is based on a history of prolonged heavy ingestion of grass peas, particularly among young, malnourished, physically exerted males, and exclusion of other myelopathies. Key findings for diagnosis include exposure to L. sativus, dose-dependent toxicity, and characteristic gait disturbance. The differential diagnosis may include HTLV-associated myelopathy (HAM), neurocassavism (konzo), and compressive, hereditary, infectious, and metabolic myelopathies. Management involves symptomatic treatment with anti-spastic drugs and physiotherapy, while prevention includes education on avoidance of L. sativus consumption and measures to reduce toxin burden.\nMeasles is a highly contagious viral infection that occurs worldwide, caused by a paramyxovirus. It presents with fever, conjunctivitis, rhinitis, and cough, followed by a maculopapular rash, often with severe desquamation. Immunocompromised individuals may have atypical presentations, including 'white measles' or late complications like subacute sclerosing panencephalitis (SSPE). Key findings for diagnosis include the typical rash, maculopapular or morbilliform type, conjunctivitis, and cough. Differential diagnoses include other viral infections, such as rubella and enterovirus, and bacterial infections like scarlet fever and meningococcal disease. Confirmation is based on clinical presentation, vaccination history, and exclusion of other conditions. Supportive treatment, vitamin A supplementation, and isolation are essential in management.\n\nA 30-year-old male Chinese trader presents with persistent fever after receiving a 5-day course of antimalarial treatment with artemether for falciparum malaria. The patient is at risk of bacterial coinfection, especially with Salmonella species, and other common infectious diseases contracted in Laos such as scrub typhus, murine typhus, leptospirosis, tuberculosis or dengue fever. Important differential diagnoses include bacterial coinfection, poor-quality or substandard antimalarial drugs, and other infectious diseases. Key findings include elevated serum liver enzymes, jaundice, and a negative blood smear for malaria parasites. The patient was treated with oral quinine sulphate and doxycycline for 7 days and made a full recovery. \nA 32-year-old man from Malawi presents with a 6-week history of productive cough, chest pain, weight loss, fevers, night sweats, and a painfully swollen neck. He has been treated for acid-fast bacilli (AFB) sputum-negative pulmonary tuberculosis 12 years ago. The patient has a CD4 count of 95 cells/\u00b5L and is on antiretroviral therapy (ART) and co-trimoxazole prophylaxis. The patient initially presents with tuberculous lymphadenitis but later develops signs of superimposed bacterial lymphadenitis, possibly iatrogenic, with probable Staphylococcus aureus infection. Key differential diagnoses include atypical mycobacteria, non-adherence to TB treatment, malabsorption, and drug resistance. The diagnosis is confirmed by microbiological examination of the lymph node aspirate, FNA of a neck gland yields purulent material.\nLassa fever is common in sub-Saharan West Africa and is thought to infect approximately 300,000 people annually. The symptoms include fever, body aches, weakness, sore throat, retrosternal chest pain, abdominal pain, diarrhea, vomiting, cough, and breathlessness, with conjunctivitis often occurring late in the disease. The disease is more severe in pregnant women, and its severity is marked by raised liver transaminases. Clinically, it is characterized by a high case fatality rate in hospitalized patients, with a particularly high case fatality rate in the third trimester of pregnancy. The diagnosis is confirmed by antigen testing, PCR, or serological tests, with the treatment being with IV ribavirin, most effective when given early in the disease. Important differential diagnoses include adenovirus infections, measles, Mycoplasma pneumoniae, Leptospirosis, and typhoid fever.\n\nMycobacterium ulcerans disease, commonly known as Buruli ulcer, primarily occurs in West Africa, mainly in children and adolescents, and presents with skin lesions ranging from papules, nodules, and plaques to ulcers. The lesions are typically painless but may be painful, and they can involve most of a limb surface or trunk, sometimes occurring at different body sites. Key findings for diagnosis include a history of living in an endemic area, particularly near water bodies such as rivers and lakes, and the presence of skin lesions showing skin alterations like induration, hypo- and hyperpigmentation, lichenification, desquamation, and possibly local edema. Important differential diagnoses include traumatic, infectious, and neoplastic causes of ulcers. The diagnosis is confirmed by PCR from a wound swab, and treatment involves combination therapy with rifampicin, streptomycin, or clarithromycin for eight weeks, along with local heat application, wound care, pain relief, surgical excision, and skin grafting, as well as physiotherapy for restricted movements.\nCutaneous leishmaniasis typically occurs in areas where sand flies are present, such as the Andes in Peru. It presents as a localized painless ulcer with raised edges, often on exposed parts of the skin. The diagnosis is confirmed by demonstration of the parasite using microscopic examination, culture or molecular techniques. Differential diagnoses include sporotrichosis, cutaneous tuberculosis, and infection by Balamuthia mandrillaris. The treatment involves systemic therapy with first-line drugs such as pentavalent antimonials, and second-line drugs like Amphotericin B or liposomal Amphotericin B may be considered, especially for L. (V.) braziliensis infection.\nA creeping eruption characterized by a linear or serpiginous, slightly elevated, erythematous track that moves forward in an irregular pattern, primarily caused by cutaneous larva migrans (CLM) due to larvae of animal hookworms, especially Ancylostoma caninum, A. braziliense, and Uncinaria stenocephala. Key symptoms include intense itchy skin eruptions, usually on the feet or areas exposed to infested sand/soil. Diagnosis is made clinically and supported by travel history, and confirmed by the presence of pruritic papules and progressing erythematous tracks with variable speed, depending on the hookworm species. The diagnosis does not rely on skin biopsy, because the larva is always in advance of its track, and no reliable serological tests are available. Treatment of choice is ivermectin (200 \u03bcg/kg for 1-2 days), or albendazole 400mg twice daily for 3 days in case of ivermectin contraindication or unavailability. Differential diagnoses include infection with larvae of Strongyloides stercoralis (larva currens), Gnathostoma species, and Fasciola species, as well as migratory myiasis.\n\n"

            "Text": "A 29-year-old presented to the emergency department (ED) of hospital A with a 4-week history of headache and fevers, followed by an acute deterioration in consciousness. He had no known medical comorbidities or allergies. He was originally from Bolivia but had lived in Europe for the last 15 years (Ireland for the past year). The patient worked as a mechanic, had no pets, no recent travel history and no unusual contacts or hobbies. In the preceding 4 weeks and prior to his deterioration, he had presented on two separate occasions to a hospital emergency department \u2013 once to hospital A and once to hospital B, a different hospital in the city. At the first visit, which was to hospital A, the patient reported a mild headache, which responded to analgesia with no red flag symptoms. Blood tests were taken, including a routine opt-out bloodborne viral (BBV) screen. The patient was discharged from the ED. The BBV screen was subsequently reported as reactive for HIV antigen and antibody. Multiple unsuccessful attempts were made by staff to contact the patient by telephone and post. Two weeks later, the patient was brought back to the emergency department of hospital A. He presented with reduced consciousness. The patient\u2019s housemates, who accompanied him to the hospital, reported worsening drowsiness over the preceding days. On initial examination, Glasgow Coma Scale (GCS) was 12/15, with unequal pupils. His temperature was 40.0\u00b0C and his heart rate was 120 beats per minute. Initial oxygen saturation was 99% in room air. One hour after presentation, GCS deteriorated from 12 to 6. Due to worsening level of consciousness and onset of respiratory failure, he was intubated and transferred to the intensive care unit (ICU). Initial blood tests showed lymphopaenia of 0.6 x 109/L (1.5-3.5 109/L), Hb 10.5g/dL (13.5 \u2013 18g/dL), and CRP 59 mg/L (0.00 \u2013 5.00mg/L). A chest radiograph showed diffuse, patchy opacification bilaterally. A brain CT showed multiple supratentorial ring-enhancing lesions bilaterally, with significant associated cerebral oedema and rightward midline shift. The patient was commenced on empiric therapy for meningitis (ceftriaxone, amoxicillin, and vancomycin) and cerebral toxoplasmosis (sulfadiazine and pyrimethamine, with folinic acid). Thoracic CT was also performed, which showed findings suggestive of Pneumocystis jirovecii pneumonia (PJP); cotrimoxazole was commenced.",

CD4 count was 6 cells/mm3, (5%) (502\u20131,749 cells/mm3, 35%\u201360%). Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) of the brain on day 1 showed multiple ring-enhancing supratentorial and infratentorial. The differential diagnosis included neuro-toxoplasmosis and other infectious and non-infectious causes of multiple brain lesions in an immunosuppressed host with the potential chance of Chagas disease",
        "answer": "The final diagnosis for this patient is HIV infection with cerebral toxoplasmosis and Pneumocystis jirovecii pneumonia (PJP). The patient presented with symptoms of headache, fever, and altered mental status, which led to a diagnosis of HIV infection. The presence of cerebral toxoplasmosis and PJP was confirmed through imaging studies and laboratory tests. The patient was treated with antibiotics and antifungal medications.",
        "contexts": "A 34-year-old HIV-positive woman from Malawi presented with slowly progressive half-sided weakness of the left arm and leg, localized to her brain. Focal brain lesions in HIV-infected individuals in tropical countries are broad, including HIV-related brain diseases such as cerebral toxoplasmosis, progressive multifocal leukoencephalopathy, CNS lymphoma, cryptococcoma, and CMV encephalitis. Cerebral TB, brain tumor, brain metastases, cerebral abscess, neurocysticercosis, neuroschistosomiasis, and Chagas' disease are also considered. The patient's clinical status worsened after ART initiation, consistent with immune reconstitution inflammatory syndrome (IRIS). A cerebral MRI showed multifocal T2 hyperintense lesions in the white matter, and a presumed diagnosis of PML was made. PML always occurs due to reactivation of the human JC polyomavirus, typically in immunosuppressed individuals, presenting with muscle weakness, sensory deficits, hemianopia, cognitive dysfunction, aphasia, and coordination and gait difficulties. Key findings to diagnose include a typical imaging pattern (hypodense on CT, hyperintense on T2-weighted MRI) without mass effect or contrast enhancement, and a history of immunosuppression\nKaposi's sarcoma primarily occurs in regions with high rates of HIV infection, particularly in sub-Saharan Africa.  It presents with skin lesions, often accompanied by facial swelling, cough, shortness of breath, and productive sputum. Important differential diagnoses include tuberculosis, which should always be considered and aggressively ruled out. Diagnosis of cutaneous disease is often made by clinical appearance, although biopsy is recommended. Endoscopic examination of the lung may be necessary to confirm pulmonary involvement. Confirmation of diagnosis is primarily based on detection of human herpesvirus-8 (HHV-8), with the help of relevant clinical presentation and imaging.\nThe patient presents with a severe febrile illness, characterized by fever, sore throat, general body ache, retrosternal chest pain, abdominal symptoms, and conjunctivitis. Hypotension and shock are also present. Bilateral conjunctivitis and no rash or lymphadenopathy are notable findings. The patient's husband died of a similar illness recently, raising the suspicion of viral haemorrhagic fever, particularly Marburg virus disease or Ebola virus disease. Differential diagnoses include malaria, typhoid fever, bacterial sepsis, measles, Zika virus, and other viral infections. The diagnosis is confirmed by detection of Marburg virus RNA or Ebola virus RNA using PCR from blood or other body fluids, with a low parasitaemia of Plasmodium falciparum. Important findings include conjunctivitis, retrosternal chest pain, and abdominal symptoms, which are indicative of the viral haemorrhagic fever.\n\nChromoblastomycosis is a chronic fungal infection of the skin and subcutaneous tissue, most commonly of hands, feet, and lower legs. It is typically caused by traumatic percutaneous inoculation of the genera Fonsecaea, Phialophora, and Cladophialophora.  The infection presents as painless lesions that develop slowly over years from the site of inoculation as verrucous nodules or plaques, gradually spreading centripetally by lymphatic or cutaneous dissemination. The disease is commonly found in rural tropical and subtropical areas and affects male agricultural workers. Important differential diagnoses include mycetoma, cutaneous tuberculosis, lepromatous leprosy, infections with atypical mycobacteria, cutaneous leishmaniasis, Kaposi's Sarcoma, and non-infectious causes such as squamous cell carcinoma, sarcoidosis, chronic eczema, and psoriasis. The diagnosis is made by direct microscopic detection of pathognomonic sclerotic cells in skin scrapings, which are brownish, round, thick-walled structures of 4 to 12 \u00b5m length. Treatment is challenging and effectiveness depends on the causative agent, the clinical form, and the severity of the lesions.\nA 46-year-old Thai woman from Thailand presents with a 2-month history of recurrent and treatment-refractory cutaneous and subcutaneous abscesses, progressive lymphadenopathy, and weight loss. The symptoms started 6-8 weeks after her return from a family visit to northern Thailand. On examination, multiple cutaneous and subcutaneous abscesses and a generalized lymphadenopathy are noted. Laboratory findings show elevated systemic markers of inflammation. The clinical picture and laboratory findings are highly suspicious of a systemic infection, and differential diagnoses include histoplasmosis, mycobacterial infections (such as melioidosis), and autoimmune syndromes. Key findings to diagnose Histoplasmosis include fungal cells identified on histopathology of a lymph node biopsy, and the presence of Histoplasma capsulatum confirmed by PCR and culture.\nGnathostomiasis is a zoonotic nematode infection caused by Gnathostoma spinigerum, acquired by eating raw or undercooked freshwater fish and crustaceans. It presents with migratory subcutaneous swellings, eosinophilia, and a serpiginous tract. Important differential diagnoses include Loa loa infection, sparganosis, strongyloidiasis, and fascioliasis. Diagnosis is confirmed by demonstration of the parasite microscopically or radiologically. Lumbar puncture and cranial imaging may be necessary for CNS disease. Treatment consists of albendazole and/or ivermectin, with adjunctive corticosteroids for CNS infection.\n\nA 31-year-old HIV-positive man presents with shortness of breath on exertion, dry cough, and drenching night sweats with significant weight loss. He has a low CD4 count and a history of extensive travel. The patient is febrile with type 1 respiratory failure and bilateral perihilar infiltrates on chest radiography. Pneumocystis pneumonia (PCP) is a high differential diagnosis. Serum 1,3 \u03b2-D-glucan is frequently elevated in patients with PCP, but it lacks specificity. Bronchoscopy and immunofluorescence or Grocott methenamine silver staining of bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL) specimens are the diagnostic tests of choice. Diagnosis of PCP is confirmed by visualizing P. jirovecii on BAL fluid (>90% sensitivity), with induced sputum having lower sensitivity. First-line treatment is with co-trimoxazole, in severe cases intravenous, with the addition of high-dose corticosteroids in moderate to severe PCP improving outcomes. Adverse effects with co-trimoxazole are common and usually occur at 6 to 14 days of treatment.\nStevens\u2013Johnson syndrome (SJS) is characterized by a life-threatening mucocutaneous hypersensitivity reaction, most commonly caused by drugs. Clinical presentation includes a generalized, non-itchy maculopapular rash, conjunctivitis, painful skin and mucosal lesions, and potentially involvement of the oral mucosa, lips, and urogenital mucosa. The diagnosis is clinical, supported by ruling out major differential diagnoses such as staphylococcal scalded skin syndrome, toxic shock syndrome, and autoimmune bullous diseases. All potentially causative drugs should be withdrawn immediately. The main treatment is supportive, with management of fluids and electrolytes, careful nutrition, and pain control.\nLeptospirosis is a zoonotic disease caused by pathogenic Leptospira species. The disease presents with a biphasic illness, initially non-specific symptoms such as fever, headache, and myalgias, followed by a second phase dominated by immune-mediated pathology. Classical presentation includes severe myalgias, subconjunctival hemorrhage, and jaundice. In severe cases, complications such as acute kidney injury, pulmonary involvement, and myocarditis may occur. Diagnosis is confirmed by PCR detection, MAT serology, or culture, and treatment involves antibiotics such as doxycycline, amoxicillin, or benzylpenicillin.\n\nAcute bacterial meningitis primarily occurs in individuals with immunocompromised status, such as HIV-positive patients, and presents with symptoms like high fever, rapid decline in consciousness, seizures, stiff neck, and altered mental status. Clinically, it is characterized by cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) analysis showing pleocytosis, increased protein, and decreased glucose. A lumbar puncture is necessary to obtain a diagnosis, and antibiotics should be administered as soon as possible. Important differential diagnoses include tuberculous meningitis, cryptococcal meningitis, and other bacterial causes like Streptococcus pneumoniae and Neisseria meningitidis.\nTuberculous meningitis primarily occurs in settings with high tuberculosis prevalence and is characterized by florid gelatinous exudate in the subarachnoid space, causing symptoms such as fever, headache, cranial nerve palsies, and altered consciousness. Clinically, it presents as a subacute illness with systemic symptoms such as weight loss, night sweats, and cough. Key CSF findings include clear appearance, lymphocytic predominance, high protein concentration, and low CSF to plasma-glucose ratio. Important differential diagnoses include bacterial, cryptococcal, and other forms of meningitis. Diagnosis is confirmed by detection of acid-fast bacilli in CSF, culture, or molecular methods such as PCR. Treatment involves isoniazid, rifampicin, ethambutol, and pyrazinamide, with corticosteroids to improve clinical outcomes.\nCryptococcal meningitis primarily occurs in sub-Saharan Africa and parts of Asia where HIV prevalence is high. It typically presents with sub-acute headache, cranial nerve palsies, confusion, and impaired consciousness. Clinically, it is characterized by raised intracranial pressure and non-specific cerebrospinal fluid findings. Important differential diagnoses include tuberculous meningitis and partially treated bacterial meningitis. The diagnosis is confirmed by demonstrating the fungus in the cerebrospinal fluid using methods such as India Ink staining, cryptococcal antigen detection, or fungal culture. Treatment consists of three phases: induction, consolidation, and maintenance, using drugs such as amphotericin B, flucytosine, and fluconazole. In resource-limited settings, alternative treatment regimens may be used due to poor drug availability.\n\nCerebral malaria is a severe neurological complication of Plasmodium falciparum infection, primarily occurring in sub-Saharan Africa. It presents with coma, no neurological localizing signs, hepatosplenomegaly, and a positive malaria rapid diagnostic test. Key findings for diagnosis include retinal whitening, hemorrhages, or orange-white vessels with or without papilloedema on ophthalmoscopy. Important differential diagnoses include bacterial meningitis, viral encephalitis, intoxication, metabolic abnormalities, and non-convulsive status epilepticus. The diagnosis is confirmed by the presence of Plasmodium falciparum parasitemia and the absence of other causes of coma, with supportive findings of malarial retinopathy on ophthalmoscopy. The mainstay of therapy is antimalarials, intensive supportive care, and diagnosis and treatment of non-malarial contributors to illness.\nOnchocerciasis, also known as \"river blindness,\" primarily occurs in rural areas near rapidly flowing rivers, particularly in West and Central Africa. The disease is characterized by a triad of ocular changes, skin changes, and subcutaneous nodules. Typical clinical features include non-tender subcutaneous nodules, dermatitis, depigmentation of the skin, and ocular changes such as keratitis, iritis, and uveitis. The diagnosis is typically made based on clinical findings and supported by serological tests. The most important differential diagnoses to consider are other causes of skin changes and ocular changes such as scabies, yaws, leprosy, mycotic infections, and eczema. The key finding to diagnose onchocerciasis is the presence of subcutaneous nodules with microfilariae of Onchocerca volvulus, which can be detected by skin snips, slit-lamp examination, or nodulectomy. The diagnosis is confirmed by detection of antibodies to O. volvulus antigens through serological tests. Treatment typically involves multiple courses of ivermectin, with or without doxycycline, and is usually provided annually in mass treatment programs.\nCerebral sparganosis, a food-borne zoonosis, primarily occurs in Asian countries, particularly China, South Korea, Thailand, and Japan, and presents with symptoms suggestive of a space-occupying lesion, such as headache, confusion, seizures, paralysis, or palsies. Important differential diagnoses include brain tumours or metastases, neurocysticercosis, cerebral schistosomiasis, and paragonimiasis. Diagnosis is confirmed by dependant history taking and serological investigations, supplemented by neuroimaging, especially MRI, which often reveals the 'tunnel sign' with hypointensity in T1-weighted and hyperintensity in T2-weighted images. The most effective treatment is the removal of the sparganum from the brain. Praziquantel treatment may also be effective.\n\n"

            "Text": "A 56-year-old otherwise healthy Guatemalan male landscaper presented to the emergency room with complaints of worsening swelling and pain in his right lower extremity over the past two months, accompanied by multiple raised and indurated lesions at various stages of healing along the right posteriomedial calf. In 2018, the patient experienced a similar episode involving the right lower extremity, during which surgical debridement and primary closure by podiatry were performed. This was followed by a two-week course of trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole (TMP-SMX) and cefazolin, resulting in complete resolution of symptoms related to coexisting Nocardia spp., methicillin-susceptible Staphylococcus aureus (MSSA), and Streptococcus agalactiae group B infections as confirmed by blood and tissue cultures at that time. The physical exam during his current presentation revealed marked edema of the distal right lower extremity, multiple granulomatous foci, and two well-healed scars along the medial and lateral aspects of the calf, attributable to his previous surgical debridement from 2018 (Figure 1). He had full strength and sensation in the affected extremity without any discernible deficits. There were no signs indicative of a systemic infection, and the patient\u2019s vital signs remained stable. A computed tomography (CT) scan was completed, showing superficial compartment edema of the posterior distal lower extremity, along with an irregular heterogenous collection in the posteriomedial calf (Figure 2). Given the uncertainty regarding deep compartment involvement and the high suspicion of a developing abscess due to a recurrent Nocardia spp. infection, the patient was subsequently taken to the operating room. The final surgical pathology from the biopsied lesions and muscle indicated small clusters of thin filiform bacteria, which stained positively for Gram and Ziehl-Neelsen, most consistent with an actinomycetoma.",

Key symptoms include intense itchy skin eruptions, usually on the feet or areas exposed to infested sand/soil. Diagnosis is made clinically and supported by travel history, and confirmed by the presence of pruritic papules and progressing erythematous tracks with variable speed, depending on the hookworm species. The diagnosis does not rely on skin biopsy, because the larva is always in advance of its track, and no reliable serological tests are available. Treatment of choice is ivermectin (200 \u03bcg/kg for 1-2 days), or albendazole 400mg twice daily for 3 days in case of ivermectin contraindication or unavailability. Differential diagnoses include infection with larvae of Strongyloides stercoralis (larva currens), Gnathostoma species, and Fasciola species, as well as migratory myiasis.\nTalaromycosis (penicilliosis) is a fungal infection that typically affects severely immunocompromised individuals, often those with HIV/AIDS. It presents with non-specific symptoms such as prolonged fever, fatigue, weight loss, and diarrhea, accompanied by clinical signs of lymphadenopathy, hepatosplenomegaly, and anemia. Generalized umbilicated papular skin lesions, often located on the face, chest, and extremities, are characteristic. Important differential diagnoses include cryptococcosis, histoplasmosis, talaromycosis, disseminated tuberculosis, and infections with atypical mycobacteria. Diagnosis is confirmed by identification of the fungus in clinical specimens, including blood, bronchoalveolar lavage fluid, or biopsies of skin, lymph nodes, or bone marrow, showing extracellular and intracellular yeasts with a transverse septum. Key diagnostic findings include a CD4 count below 100 cells/\u00b5L, and treatment is with intravenous amphotericin B followed by oral itraconazole, with secondary prophylaxis in HIV-infected patients.\n\nNoma is primarily encountered in the poorest children in developing countries, often with compromised immunity from malnutrition and vitamin deficiencies. Its symptoms begin with a sore on the face and bad breath, quickly advancing to a gangrenous lesion that can destroy tissue, with cases reported having a high case fatality rate of 70-90%. The diagnosis is primarily clinical, with other diseases such as malaria, measles, and oral cancer being unlikely causes. A confirmed diagnosis is not feasible with any diagnostic lab tests, hence it is crucial for a health worker to recognize noma based on symptoms and take action as it is treatable with antibiotics, nutritional support, and surgery. Other complications from the disease should also be looked for and treated in conjunction with the ongoing care.\nInvasive non-typhoidal Salmonellae (iNTS) infection primarily presents with non-specific febrile illness, abdominal pain or history of diarrhea, mild splenomegaly, and severe anaemia. Clinically, it is characterized by aseptic fever, weight loss, and progressive weakness, with some patients reporting abdominal pain or history of diarrhea. Important differential diagnoses include typhoid and paratyphoid, malaria, and tuberculosis. The diagnosis is confirmed by detection of Salmonella enterica var Typhimurium in blood cultures, supported by relevant clinical presentation and epidemiological context. Severe anaemia is common and should prompt the clinician to look carefully for signs of TB co-infection.\nMelioidosis is caused by the bacterium Burkholderia pseudomallei, which endemic to South and South-east Asia, and northern Australia. The patient presents with fever, headache, generalized myalgia and arthralgia, a painful swelling over the left scapula, and bilateral pleural effusions. Clinically, it is characterized by sepsis, pneumonia, skin and soft tissue abscesses, and disseminated abscess formation. Important differential diagnoses include bacterial abscess with sepsis, tuberculosis, and disseminated fungal infection. The diagnosis is confirmed by isolation and identification of B. pseudomallei in clinical samples, which may be achieved by various laboratory methods such as microscopy, culture, PCR on clinical specimens, immunofluorescence, and lateral flow immunoassay, antigen latex agglutination on isolates. Blood culture, abscess swab, throat swab, and imaging studies such as chest X-ray and ultrasound are also essential for diagnosis. Treatment involves parenteral antibiotics (e.g. ceftazidime, meropenem) for 2 weeks, followed by oral co-trimoxazole to complete 3 to 6 months eradication therapy.\n\nMeasles is a highly contagious viral infection that occurs worldwide, caused by a paramyxovirus. It presents with fever, conjunctivitis, rhinitis, and cough, followed by a maculopapular rash, often with severe desquamation. Immunocompromised individuals may have atypical presentations, including 'white measles' or late complications like subacute sclerosing panencephalitis (SSPE). Key findings for diagnosis include the typical rash, maculopapular or morbilliform type, conjunctivitis, and cough. Differential diagnoses include other viral infections, such as rubella and enterovirus, and bacterial infections like scarlet fever and meningococcal disease. Confirmation is based on clinical presentation, vaccination history, and exclusion of other conditions. Supportive treatment, vitamin A supplementation, and isolation are essential in management.\nHyperreactive malarial splenomegaly (HMS) is a condition caused by an abnormal immune response to repeated infections with Plasmodium falciparum, P. malariae, or P. vivax, leading to massive splenomegaly and hypersplenism. The condition is more common in women than in men, mainly affects those between 20 and 40 years, and has a genetic background with ethnic and familial clustering. Symptoms include abdominal heaviness or discomfort, low-grade fever, anaemia, and bi- or pancytopenia. Diagnosis is primarily based on clinical findings and exclusion of other causes, and treatment involves lifelong antimalarial therapy in endemic settings, or a single treatment course for migrants living in non-endemic areas.\nA 46-year-old Thai woman from Thailand presents with a 2-month history of recurrent and treatment-refractory cutaneous and subcutaneous abscesses, progressive lymphadenopathy, and weight loss. The symptoms started 6-8 weeks after her return from a family visit to northern Thailand. On examination, multiple cutaneous and subcutaneous abscesses and a generalized lymphadenopathy are noted. Laboratory findings show elevated systemic markers of inflammation. The clinical picture and laboratory findings are highly suspicious of a systemic infection, and differential diagnoses include histoplasmosis, mycobacterial infections (such as melioidosis), and autoimmune syndromes. Key findings to diagnose Histoplasmosis include fungal cells identified on histopathology of a lymph node biopsy, and the presence of Histoplasma capsulatum confirmed by PCR and culture.\n\nBartonellosis, caused by B. bacilliformis, is a vector-borne disease mainly found in the Andean valleys of Peru, transmitted by female sandflies. The disease is characterized by a severe haemolytic anaemia with jaundice, high fever, malaise, myalgias, and CNS involvement. It progresses to a chronic angioproliferative cutaneous stage ('verruga peruana') in approximately 5% of treated patients and an unknown percentage of untreated individuals. Diagnosis is made by proof of cocco-bacilli inside red blood cells, while treatment of the acute phase includes ciprofloxacin alone or combined with ceftriaxone in severe cases. The differential diagnoses include malaria and bartonellosis, as well as several non-infectious causes of haemolysis.\nA 32-year-old man from Malawi presents with a 6-week history of productive cough, chest pain, weight loss, fevers, night sweats, and a painfully swollen neck. He has been treated for acid-fast bacilli (AFB) sputum-negative pulmonary tuberculosis 12 years ago. The patient has a CD4 count of 95 cells/\u00b5L and is on antiretroviral therapy (ART) and co-trimoxazole prophylaxis. The patient initially presents with tuberculous lymphadenitis but later develops signs of superimposed bacterial lymphadenitis, possibly iatrogenic, with probable Staphylococcus aureus infection. Key differential diagnoses include atypical mycobacteria, non-adherence to TB treatment, malabsorption, and drug resistance. The diagnosis is confirmed by microbiological examination of the lymph node aspirate, FNA of a neck gland yields purulent material.\nThe patient is a 55-year-old woman from Vietnam who presents with fever, headache, vomiting, confusion, and impaired consciousness. She has a petechial rash and purpuric non-blanching lesions on her trunk and leg. The patient has a history of type 2 diabetes and hypertension. The diagnosis is confirmed by lumbar puncture showing turbid cerebrospinal fluid with high neutrophil count, high protein, and low CSF glucose ratio. Blood cultures grow Streptococcus suis, sensitive to penicillin and ceftriaxone. The patient receives 12 days of antibiotic therapy and steroids, and responds to treatment but has residual bilateral hearing impairment. Key findings to diagnose this exact disease include CSF analysis, blood cultures, and Gram stain. Differential diagnoses include malaria, enteric fever, dengue fever, and melioidosis.\n\nA 46-year-old Thai woman from Thailand presents with a 2-month history of recurrent and treatment-refractory cutaneous and subcutaneous abscesses, progressive lymphadenopathy, and weight loss. The symptoms started 6-8 weeks after her return from a family visit to northern Thailand. On examination, multiple cutaneous and subcutaneous abscesses and a generalized lymphadenopathy are noted. Laboratory findings show elevated systemic markers of inflammation. The clinical picture and laboratory findings are highly suspicious of a systemic infection, and differential diagnoses include histoplasmosis, mycobacterial infections (such as melioidosis), and autoimmune syndromes. Key findings to diagnose Histoplasmosis include fungal cells identified on histopathology of a lymph node biopsy, and the presence of Histoplasma capsulatum confirmed by PCR and culture.\nStevens\u2013Johnson syndrome (SJS) is characterized by a life-threatening mucocutaneous hypersensitivity reaction, most commonly caused by drugs. Clinical presentation includes a generalized, non-itchy maculopapular rash, conjunctivitis, painful skin and mucosal lesions, and potentially involvement of the oral mucosa, lips, and urogenital mucosa. The diagnosis is clinical, supported by ruling out major differential diagnoses such as staphylococcal scalded skin syndrome, toxic shock syndrome, and autoimmune bullous diseases. All potentially causative drugs should be withdrawn immediately. The main treatment is supportive, with management of fluids and electrolytes, careful nutrition, and pain control.\nCerebral sparganosis, a food-borne zoonosis, primarily occurs in Asian countries, particularly China, South Korea, Thailand, and Japan, and presents with symptoms suggestive of a space-occupying lesion, such as headache, confusion, seizures, paralysis, or palsies. Important differential diagnoses include brain tumours or metastases, neurocysticercosis, cerebral schistosomiasis, and paragonimiasis. Diagnosis is confirmed by dependant history taking and serological investigations, supplemented by neuroimaging, especially MRI, which often reveals the 'tunnel sign' with hypointensity in T1-weighted and hyperintensity in T2-weighted images. The most effective treatment is the removal of the sparganum from the brain. Praziquantel treatment may also be effective.\n\n"

It typically presents with transitory ischemic attacks, manifesting as parenchymal calcified lesions, complex cystic structures in the subarachnoid space, and an old lacunar infarct. Subarachnoid neurocysticercosis, the most severe form, is probably caused by the host's inflammatory response, manifesting as meningitis, communicating hydrocephalus, focal neurological symptoms, and cerebrovascular disease. Important differential diagnoses include other forms of neurocysticercosis, such as parenchymal neurocysticercosis, and other diseases causing similar imaging findings. The diagnosis is confirmed by MRI and serology, specifically the immunoblot with a sensitivity of 98% and specificity of near 100%, showing a high burden of disease. Treatment involves dual therapy with albendazole and praziquantel, corticosteroids, and a careful taper to avoid complications. The duration of treatment is still controversial, but current guidelines recommend treating until resolution on neuroimaging.\nCerebral sparganosis, a food-borne zoonosis, primarily occurs in Asian countries, particularly China, South Korea, Thailand, and Japan, and presents with symptoms suggestive of a space-occupying lesion, such as headache, confusion, seizures, paralysis, or palsies. Important differential diagnoses include brain tumours or metastases, neurocysticercosis, cerebral schistosomiasis, and paragonimiasis. Diagnosis is confirmed by dependant history taking and serological investigations, supplemented by neuroimaging, especially MRI, which often reveals the 'tunnel sign' with hypointensity in T1-weighted and hyperintensity in T2-weighted images. The most effective treatment is the removal of the sparganum from the brain. Praziquantel treatment may also be effective.\nCystic echinococcosis (CE) is characterized by the development of cystic lesions in the liver or lungs due to the larval form of the Echinococcus granulosus tapeworm. The primary symptom is abdominal pain, but it may progress to biliary obstruction, bacterial infection, cyst rupture, or compression syndromes. The diagnosis is based on imaging, mainly ultrasound, and classification of disease activity. Treatment options include anthelmintic therapy, percutaneous intervention, surgery, or a 'watch and wait' approach, depending on the individual case, local resources, and disease activity. The key to effective management is early detection of complications and long-term follow-up to prevent recurrence.\n\nTuberculous meningitis primarily occurs in settings with high tuberculosis prevalence and is characterized by florid gelatinous exudate in the subarachnoid space, causing symptoms such as fever, headache, cranial nerve palsies, and altered consciousness. Clinically, it presents as a subacute illness with systemic symptoms such as weight loss, night sweats, and cough.

Key findings for diagnosis include a solitary liver mass on imaging, elevated CA19-9 level, and detection of liver flukes or histological examination of the tumour showing infiltrative compact glandular structures. Important additional information to obtain from the patient includes a history of eating raw or undercooked freshwater fish containing metacercariae of the parasites, which is a risk factor for infection.\nEosinophilic meningitis primarily occurs in South-east Asia and is caused by angiostrongylus cantonensis, a rat lungworm, which is transmitted through the consumption of infected crustaceans, snails, prawns, crabs, frogs, or contaminated vegetables. Symptoms include severe headache, paraesthesia of the trunk, limbs, or face, and a creeping eruption. Diagnosis is confirmed by a lumbar puncture revealing eosinophilic meningitis, with a high eosinophil count in the cerebrospinal fluid. Differential diagnoses include fungal meningitis, lymphoma, eosinophilic leukemia, sarcoid, and idiopathic hypereosinophilic syndrome. Key findings for diagnosis include a high Eosinophil count in the CSF, elevated IgE levels, and a positive western blot test for antibodies against the 31KD antigen of angiostrongylus cantonensis. Treatment is primarily supportive, with mild cases managed symptomatically and more severe cases treated with corticosteroids and antiparasitic drugs.\n\nAcute schistosomiasis (Katayama syndrome) typically occurs 2 to 12 weeks after Schistosoma infection, and presents with fever, urticaria, cough, and eosinophilia. Patchy pulmonary infiltrates or micronodular changes in the lower lung zones may be present on chest radiograph. The diagnosis is challenging due to the lack of Schistosoma ova in urine or stool at the early stage and delayed serological tests. PCR-based methods may be useful for the diagnosis. Praziquantel treatment should be delayed until the flukes are adult, and supportive steroid therapy may be necessary for severe symptoms or neurological complications.\nInfantile beriberi, the 'wet' form of thiamine (vitamin B1) deficiency in infants, typically presents in exclusively breastfed babies of approximately 2 to 3 months of age, with mothers having thiamine deficiency resulting from inadequate thiamine intake.

He has advanced immunosuppression with a CD4 count of 54 cells/\u03bcL. The suspected diagnosis is smear-negative pulmonary tuberculosis (TB), which is a common presentation in HIV-infected patients. Key findings include productive cough, whitish sputum, night sweats, weight loss, and a prominent hilar region on chest radiography. The diagnosis is confirmed by induced sputum examination for acid-fast bacilli (AFB) and real-time PCR-based tests like Xpert MTB/RIF. The differential diagnoses include Pneumocystis jirovecii pneumonia (PCP), Kaposi's sarcoma, and pulmonary malignancy. Key findings to diagnose TB include normal or abnormal chest radiography, negative sputum AFB microscopy, and positive PCR for TB.\n\nMelioidosis is caused by the bacterium Burkholderia pseudomallei, which endemic to South and South-east Asia, and northern Australia. The patient presents with fever, headache, generalized myalgia and arthralgia, a painful swelling over the left scapula, and bilateral pleural effusions. Clinically, it is characterized by sepsis, pneumonia, skin and soft tissue abscesses, and disseminated abscess formation. Important differential diagnoses include bacterial abscess with sepsis, tuberculosis, and disseminated fungal infection. The diagnosis is confirmed by isolation and identification of B. pseudomallei in clinical samples, which may be achieved by various laboratory methods such as microscopy, culture, PCR on clinical specimens, immunofluorescence, and lateral flow immunoassay, antigen latex agglutination on isolates. Blood culture, abscess swab, throat swab, and imaging studies such as chest X-ray and ultrasound are also essential for diagnosis. Treatment involves parenteral antibiotics (e.g. ceftazidime, meropenem) for 2 weeks, followed by oral co-trimoxazole to complete 3 to 6 months eradication therapy.\nMycobacterium ulcerans disease, commonly known as Buruli ulcer, primarily occurs in West Africa, mainly in children and adolescents, and presents with skin lesions ranging from papules, nodules, and plaques to ulcers. The lesions are typically painless but may be painful, and they can involve most of a limb surface or trunk, sometimes occurring at different body sites. Key findings for diagnosis include a history of living in an endemic area, particularly near water bodies such as rivers and lakes, and the presence of skin lesions showing skin alterations like induration, hypo- and hyperpigmentation, lichenification, desquamation, and possibly local edema. Important differential diagnoses include traumatic, infectious, and neoplastic causes of ulcers. The diagnosis is confirmed by PCR from a wound swab, and treatment involves combination therapy with rifampicin, streptomycin, or clarithromycin for eight weeks, along with local heat application, wound care, pain relief, surgical excision, and skin grafting, as well as physiotherapy for restricted movements.\nSickle cell disease is a hereditary disorder that primarily occurs in Africa and Asia and typically presents with chronic leg ulcers, particularly in areas with thin skin and little subcutaneous fat such as the ankles. Ulcers are slow to heal, painful, and characterized by unexplained relapses. Important differential diagnoses include tropical ulcer, diabetic ulcer, chronic osteomyelitis, and pyoderma gangrenosum. The diagnosis is confirmed by detection of HbS in red blood cells using a sickle slide, solubility test, or haemoglobin electrophoresis. Key findings include abnormal sickled red blood cells, polychromasia, target cells, nucleated red cells, and a high white cell count.\n\n"
