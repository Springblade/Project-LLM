In April 2014, he and his team established an EVD care unit in Monrovia, and patients with confirmed EVD began arriving at this facility on June 11, 2014. On July 23, 2014, he awoke feeling febrile and fatigued; his oral temperature was 37.8\u00b0C. He reported his symptoms to colleagues and remained at home. Results on two rapid diagnostic tests for malaria (Standard Diagnostics) were negative. He started empirical malaria treatment with artemether and lumefantrine. Later that day, his oral temperature was 38.6\u00b0C, and nausea developed. He was tested for malaria by means of a rapid diagnostic test and for yellow fever, Lassa fever, and EBOV by means of semiquantitative real-time reverse-transcriptase\u2013polymerase-chain-reaction (RT-PCR) assays, all of which were performed at the Liberian National Reference Laboratory. The results for all the tests were negative.",

In 2018, the patient experienced a similar episode involving the right lower extremity, during which surgical debridement and primary closure by podiatry were performed. This was followed by a two-week course of trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole (TMP-SMX) and cefazolin, resulting in complete resolution of symptoms related to coexisting Nocardia spp., methicillin-susceptible Staphylococcus aureus (MSSA), and Streptococcus agalactiae group B infections as confirmed by blood and tissue cultures at that time. The physical exam during his current presentation revealed marked edema of the distal right lower extremity, multiple granulomatous foci, and two well-healed scars along the medial and lateral aspects of the calf, attributable to his previous surgical debridement from 2018 (Figure 1). He had full strength and sensation in the affected extremity without any discernible deficits. There were no signs indicative of a systemic infection, and the patient\u2019s vital signs remained stable.

Initial brain computerized tomography (CT) scan showed no significant abnormality. Following the brain CT, a lumbar puncture was performed. The appearance of the CSF was a thick yellow liquid resembling pus (Figure 2). The CSF WBC count was 158,000 cells/\u03bcL (0\u20135 cells/\u03bcL), the CSF protein 18.67\u2009mg/mL (0.15 to 0.6\u2009mg/mL), the CSF lactic acid 42.37\u2009mmol/L (0\u20133\u2009mmol/L), the CSF glucose 0.1\u2009mg/100\u2009mL (50\u201380\u2009mg/100\u2009mL), the CSF RBCs were less than 1 RBC/mm3 (<1 RBC/mm3), and the CSF culture indicated S. pneumoniae (see endnote 1). He was started on a regimen with intravenous meropenem 2000 mg every 8 h and intravenous vancomycin 1200\u2009mg every 8\u2009h, and dexamethasone 12\u2009mg every 6\u2009h. He was also given one dose of intravenous metronidazole 1200\u2009mg once. Intravenous ceftriaxone 2000\u2009mg every 12\u2009h was also added to the regimen. Due to respiratory failure, he was intubated with an endotracheal tube and transferred to an intensive care unit. On the second day of admission, his level of consciousness deteriorated, and his Glasgow Coma Scale (GCS) was 3 out of 15. A repeated brain CT scan showed multiple hypodensities and brain venogram revealed multiple filling defects in the superior sagittal sinus and left transverse sinus (Figure 3). The brain magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) showed extensive gyriform diffusion restriction abnormality involving the frontal, anterior temporal lobes, insular cortices, and bilateral deep gray nuclei and brainstem suggestive of meningoencephalitis with gyriform hemorrhagic foci in the insula and frontal lobes Multiple small collections were also noted along the leptomeningeal surface of the brain stem and cerebellar convexities representing exudates.",

        "ground_truth": "The patient presented with an acute febrile illness, severe headache, altered mental status, and classic meningeal signs (neck stiffness, positive Kernig and Brudzinski signs). Cerebrospinal fluid analysis showed purulent appearance, extremely elevated leukocyte count, markedly increased protein, very low glucose, and high lactate, all characteristic of acute bacterial meningitis. Definitive diagnosis was confirmed by CSF culture growing Streptococcus pneumoniae, consistent with his risk factors of chronic otitis media and prior neurosurgical complications.",
        "answer": "The final diagnosis for this patient is bacterial meningitis with complications such as hydrocephalus and brain abscesses. The patient had a history of bacterial meningitis and hydrocephalus, and the clinical presentation included fever, headache, altered sensorium, and papilledema. The laboratory findings, including a high WBC count, low potassium, and low CSF glucose, as well as the positive CSF culture for S. pneumoniae, supported the diagnosis of bacterial meningitis. The imaging studies, including brain CT and MRI, showed multiple hypodensities and brain venogram filling defects, consistent with brain abscesses and meningoencephalitis. The patient was treated with antibiotics and dexamethasone, and the final diagnosis was confirmed by the clinical response to treatment and the resolution of the imaging findings.",
        "contexts" : "Acute bacterial meningitis: Immunocompromised (e.g., HIV-positive) patient with high fever, rapid decline in consciousness, seizures, neck stiffness, and altered mental status; CSF shows pleocytosis, high protein, and low glucose; diagnosis via lumbar puncture and urgent antibiotics required, with TB and cryptococcal meningitis as key differentials. Tuberculous meningitis: Patient from a high TB-prevalence setting presenting with subacute fever, headache, cranial nerve palsies, altered consciousness, weight loss, and night sweats; CSF is clear with lymphocytic predominance, high protein, and low CSF–plasma glucose ratio; diagnosis confirmed by AFB, culture, or PCR. Cryptococcal meningitis: HIV-infected patient from sub-Saharan Africa or Asia presenting with subacute headache, confusion, cranial nerve palsies, raised intracranial pressure, and impaired consciousness; diagnosis confirmed by India ink, cryptococcal antigen, or fungal culture from CSF. Subarachnoid neurocysticercosis: Patient from poor-sanitation rural settings (e.g., Guatemala) presenting with meningitis, communicating hydrocephalus, focal neurological deficits, or cerebrovascular disease; MRI shows subarachnoid cystic lesions and diagnosis confirmed by immunoblot serology. Eosinophilic meningitis (Angiostrongylus cantonensis): Patient from Southeast Asia with severe headache, paraesthesia, and possible creeping eruption after consuming infected snails or crustaceans; lumbar puncture reveals eosinophilic meningitis with high CSF eosinophil count. Melioidosis: Patient from South or Southeast Asia presenting with fever, headache, myalgia, painful soft-tissue swelling, pleural effusions, and sepsis; diagnosis confirmed by isolation of Burkholderia pseudomallei from blood or abscess cultures, with pneumonia and disseminated abscesses common."
