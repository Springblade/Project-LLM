         "Text": "The first patient was a 33-year-old physician who had been working in Liberia since October 2013, during which time he had remained healthy while taking daily combination therapy with atovaquone and proguanil as prophylaxis against malaria. In April 2014, he and his team established an EVD care unit in Monrovia, and patients with confirmed EVD began arriving at this facility on June 11, 2014. On July 23, 2014, he awoke feeling febrile and fatigued; his oral temperature was 37.8°C. He reported his symptoms to colleagues and remained at home. Results on two rapid diagnostic tests for malaria (Standard Diagnostics) were negative. He started empirical malaria treatment with artemether and lumefantrine. Later that day, his oral temperature was 38.6°C, and nausea developed. He was tested for malaria by means of a rapid diagnostic test and for yellow fever, Lassa fever, and EBOV by means of semiquantitative real-time reverse-transcriptase–polymerase-chain-reaction (RT-PCR) assays, all of which were performed at the Liberian National Reference Laboratory. The results for all the tests were negative.",

      "ground_truth": "Despite initially negative RT-PCR results, the patient had high-risk occupational exposure while working in an Ebola treatment unit in Liberia during an active outbreak and developed an acute febrile illness with systemic symptoms. Early testing for EBOV can be falsely negative because viral loads may be below the detection threshold in the first days of illness. The epidemiologic context and compatible clinical presentation strongly support Ebola virus disease over other tropical infections.",
      "answer": "The final diagnosis for this 33-year-old male physician from Liberia is malaria. Despite his exposure to Ebola virus disease (EVD) and the presence of fever, fatigue, and a generalized maculopapular rash, which initially raised suspicion for EVD, the rapid diagnostic tests for malaria were negative, and the clinical picture was consistent with malaria. The absence of significant lymphadenopathy and the negative results for other arboviruses like Zika, Dengue, and Chikungunya further support this diagnosis.",
      "contexts": "A 24-year-old woman from Uganda presents with a febrile illness, sore throat, abdominal pain, diarrhea, and bilateral conjunctivitis, with a history of her husband's recent death from a similar illness. The differential diagnoses include malaria, typhoid fever, invasive meningococcal disease, adenovirus, influenza, measles, Zika virus, and viral hemorrhagic fever (VHF), with Marburg virus disease being a key consideration given the husband's occupation in a gold mine. Testing should be done with caution, and samples should be sent to a specialized laboratory for PCR. The patient is treated with supportive care and resuscitation, and strict infection control measures should be followed.\nThis patient, a 35-year-old Peruvian logger, presents with acute febrile illness that produces liver failure, jaundice, bleeding, encephalopathy, and seizures. The diagnosis is confirmed by IgM capture ELISA positivity for yellow fever virus, which is a flavivirus transmitted by Aedes and Haemagogus mosquitoes. The symptoms presented include fever, jaundice, coffee-ground vomiting, gross hematuria, and mental obtundation. Clinically, it is characterized by rapid progression to gastrointestinal illness, dehydration, and multiorgan dysfunction. Important differential diagnoses include severe malaria, viral hepatitis, toxin-mediated hepatitis, leptospirosis, and dengue hemorrhagic fever. The diagnosis is confirmed by detection of yellow fever virus through IgM capture ELISA, supported by relevant epidemiological exposure to the virus.\nLassa fever primarily occurs in sub-Saharan West Africa, including Liberia, Sierra Leone, Ghana, and Nigeria, and possibly other areas of sub-Saharan West Africa. The disease starts insidiously with fever, body aches, and weakness, often accompanied by sore throat, retrosternal chest pain, abdominal symptoms such as pain, diarrhea, and vomiting, cough, and breathlessness. Conjunctivitis is common, especially late in the disease. Raised liver transaminases are markers of severity and are associated with a higher case fatality rate. Important differential diagnoses include adenovirus infections, measles, Mycoplasma pneumoniae, leptospirosis, and typhoid fever. The diagnosis is confirmed with antigen testing or PCR tests. The treatment is with IV ribavirin, which should be given early in the disease and can be beneficial, but the quality of studies on this are poor.\nThis patient, a 35-year-old Peruvian logger, presents with acute febrile illness that produces liver failure, jaundice, bleeding, encephalopathy, and seizures. The diagnosis is confirmed by IgM capture ELISA positivity for yellow fever virus, which is a flavivirus transmitted by Aedes and Haemagogus mosquitoes.

Clinically, it is characterized by rapid progression to gastrointestinal illness, dehydration, and multiorgan dysfunction. Important differential diagnoses include severe malaria, viral hepatitis, toxin-mediated hepatitis, leptospirosis, and dengue hemorrhagic fever. The diagnosis is confirmed by detection of yellow fever virus through IgM capture ELISA, supported by relevant epidemiological exposure to the virus.\nBrucellosis is a common zoonotic bacterial infection that primarily presents as a non-focal febrile illness with symptoms such as night sweats, fatigue, lymphadenopathy, and hepatosplenomegaly. Localized infection can develop, affecting the musculoskeletal, genitourinary, central nervous, or cardiovascular system, with osteoarticular involvement being particularly common, often presenting as peripheral arthritis, sacroiliitis, or spondylitis. The diagnosis is confirmed by isolation of the causative agent, Brucella melitensis, from blood or tissue samples. The disease is treatable with a combination of antimicrobials, such as doxycycline and rifampicin, for a prolonged course of 6-12 weeks or more, depending on the organ manifestation and severity. Important differential diagnoses include spinal tuberculosis, and the disease is more common in highly endemic countries like Afghanistan.\nBrucellosis, primarily acquired through consuming raw or undercooked meat and offal or untreated dairy products, typically presents with non-specific symptoms like fever, sweating, fatigue, weight loss, headache, and joint pain persisting for weeks or even months. Endocarditis is a less common manifestation, characterized by cardiac valve involvement. The diagnosis requires isolation of the bacteria from the blood, body fluids, or tissues, which can be challenging, especially in endemic settings. Differential diagnoses include malaria, tuberculosis, and other zoonotic infections like Q-fever. Diagnosis of Brucellosis is usually challenging in regions where malaria and tuberculosis are highly prevalent. The most effective treatment is a combination of antibiotics, including doxycycline, gentamicin, rifampicin, and co-trimoxazole for several weeks to months, depending on the clinical course and organ manifestation, with valve replacement in some cases.\nA 24-year-old woman from Uganda presents with a febrile illness, sore throat, abdominal pain, diarrhea, and bilateral conjunctivitis, with a history of her husband's recent death from a similar illness.

The differential diagnoses include other forms of bacterial meningitis, melioidosis, and dengue fever. The key finding to diagnose this disease is the presence of a non-blanching purpuric rash and severe neurological symptoms in a patient with a history of contact with pigs. Lab tests, including cerebrospinal fluid culture and PCR, are crucial for confirming the diagnosis. The treatment is ceftriaxone, with adjunctive corticosteroids reducing the risk of deafness.\nA 24-year-old woman from Uganda presents with a febrile illness, sore throat, abdominal pain, diarrhea, and bilateral conjunctivitis, with a history of her husband's recent death from a similar illness. The differential diagnoses include malaria, typhoid fever, invasive meningococcal disease, adenovirus, influenza, measles, Zika virus, and viral hemorrhagic fever (VHF), with Marburg virus disease being a key consideration given the husband's occupation in a gold mine. Testing should be done with caution, and samples should be sent to a specialized laboratory for PCR. The patient is treated with supportive care and resuscitation, and strict infection control measures should be followed.\nThe disease primarily occurs in the Amazonian rainforest and typically presents with acute febrile illness lasting 3-7 days, characterized by chills, headache, retro-orbital and epigastric pain, myalgia, arthralgia, nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, and a maculopapular rash, sometimes followed by desquamation. Haemorrhagic manifestations are rare. Prolonged polyarthralgias, which are suspected to arise from the inflammatory immune response stimulated by the prolonged virus persistence in joint tissues, can occur after the initial fever resolves. Important differential diagnoses include reactive arthritis, viral arthritis, and other alphavirus infections. The diagnosis is confirmed by detection of Mayaro virus RNA using PCR in blood or, beyond the acute phase, by serological detection of specific IgM and IgG antibodies against the Mayaro virus, using a two-step approach with highly sensitive screening assays followed by highly specific confirmatory assays.\nEosinophilic meningitis, primarily occurring in South-east Asia and the Pacific basin, typically presents with headache and parasesthesia of the trunk, limbs, or face. Clinically, it is characterized by a migratory subcutaneous swelling, creeping eruption, and sharp radicular pain at onset. Important differential diagnoses include fungal meningitis with Coccidioides immitis, lymphoma, eosinophilic leukemia, sarcoid, and idiopathic hypereosinophilic syndrome. Diagnosis is confirmed by the presence of ten or more eosinophils per microliter of CSF, or eosinophilia of at least 10% of the total CSF leukocyte count, and Western blot showing specific antibodies against the 31 kD Angiostrongylus cantonensis antigen. Treatment is symptomatic and may involve corticosteroids and antiparasitic drugs.\nThis 52-year-old man from Vietnam presented with evolving shock, symptoms include abdominal pain, vomiting, retro-orbital headache, lethargy, myalgia, and fevers. Clinically, it is characterized by low Glasgow Coma Score, tachycardia, narrow pulse pressure, respiratory distress, and mild abdominal distension. Important differential diagnoses include dengue infection, scrub typhus, leptospirosis, and malaria. The diagnosis of dengue infection is confirmed by detection of NS1 antigen by RDTs or ELISA or detection of viral RNA using RT-PCR. Key findings that suggest severe dengue include abdominal pain or tenderness, persistent vomiting, fluid accumulation, mucosal bleeding, and increasing haematocrit with concurrent worsening of thrombocytopenia.\nThis 52-year-old man from Vietnam presented with evolving shock, symptoms include abdominal pain, vomiting, retro-orbital headache, lethargy, myalgia, and fevers.

Clinical findings include a generalized rash involving the palms of the hands, without lymphadenopathy, anemia, or jaundice. The key finding for diagnosis is positive treponemal serological test for syphilis, ideally with RPR titre of 1:8, which is a common differential diagnosis in pregnant women with a rash. The disease may cause various congenital syphilis symptoms in the baby including a generalized bullous rash, jaundice and hepatosplenomegaly. Diagnosis is confirmed by treating with intramuscular benzathine penicillin.\nThis 20-year-old woman from the Democratic Republic of the Congo presents with acute febrile illness and disseminated uniform vesiculopustular skin rash including the palms and soles of the feet, as well as the oral mucosa. The lesions progress from macules to papules, vesicles, and pustules. The main differential diagnoses include monkeypox, smallpox, cowpox, and varicella, with important criteria to distinguish between them including distribution of skin lesions, stage of lesion development, involvement of palms and soles, presence of fever, and lymphadenopathy.\nThe patient, a 51-year-old female traveller, presents with a generalized maculopapular rash, bilateral conjunctivitis, peripheral painful oedema (hands, elbows, knees, and feet), and generalized lymphadenopathy. This presentation is suggestive of an arboviral infection, particularly Zika virus infection. Key findings to diagnose this exact disease include: detection of viral RNA, viral antigen, or specific IgM in blood samples, and seroconversion (rise in IgG) in paired serum samples. The patient's diagnosis was confirmed by PCR and seroconversion, with a rise in anti-Zika IgM and IgG titres.\nSevere Fever With Thrombocytopenia Syndrome (SFTS) primarily occurs in Japan, China, and Korea, transmitted by tick bites. It typically presents with fever, nausea, diarrhea, arthralgia, myalgia, and neurological symptoms, with laboratory results showing leukopenia, thrombocytopenia, and elevated serum AST, ALT, LDH, and CK levels. Important differential diagnosis includes tick- and mite-borne infectious diseases, such as Japanese spotted fever and scrub typhus. The diagnosis is confirmed by detecting SFTS virus in blood serum by PCR, and the management involves symptomatic and supportive treatment, close monitoring of respiratory condition and blood pressure, and management of thrombocytopenia and secondary bacterial infection.\nScrub typhus primarily occurs in the Asia-Pacific region and is transmitted by the bite of an infected larva (chigger) of a trombiculid mite. Infected patients typically present with fever, severe headache, myalgia, regional or generalized lymphadenopathy, and a macular or maculopapular rash. CNS involvement is common, with presentations including diffuse encephalopathy, reversible sensorineural deafness, and extrapyramidal manifestations. Diagnosis is challenging and often relies on clinical evidence, with serological tests available in some settings. Standard treatment is with doxycycline 100 mg bid for 1 week, and the disease is responsive to antibiotic treatment.\nA 24-year-old woman from Uganda presents with a febrile illness, sore throat, abdominal pain, diarrhea, and bilateral conjunctivitis, with a history of her husband's recent death from a similar illness. The differential diagnoses include malaria, typhoid fever, invasive meningococcal disease, adenovirus, influenza, measles, Zika virus, and viral hemorrhagic fever (VHF), with Marburg virus disease being a key consideration given the husband's occupation in a gold mine. Testing should be done with caution, and samples should be sent to a specialized laboratory for PCR. The patient is treated with supportive care and resuscitation, and strict infection control measures should be followed.\nLeprosy is characterized by a pale or hypopigmented macule skin lesion often located on a distal peripheral area which may accompany neuropathic symptoms. A key feature of leprosy  includes one or more hypopigmented anaesthetic skin patches and thickened peripheral nerves. Leprosy is categorized based on the number of skin lesions, which determines the duration of treatment. Clinically, tuberculoid leprosy or borderline tuberculoid leprosy occurs with high cell-mediated immunity against M. leprae, whereas, lepromatous leprosy without an adequate cell-mediated response presents with many skin lesions. The diagnosis is largely clinical without reliable diagnostic or screening tests. Treatment of leprosy involves multidrug therapy with at least 3 drugs, often involving rifampicin, clofazimine, and dapsone, which varies in duration based on the classification, from 6 months in paucibacillary leprosy to 12 months in multibacillary leprosy. Additional investigations like skin biopsy and slit-skin smear can be performed to support the diagnosis. Leprosy awareness campaigns emphasize the importance of consulting healthcare professionals for pale patches causing reduced sensation, as leprosy is a significant public health issue in endemic countries.\nA 46-year-old Thai woman presents with a 2-month history of recurrent and treatment-refractory cutaneous and subcutaneous abscesses, progressive lymphadenopathy, and weight loss. Symptoms started 6-8 weeks after returning from a visit to northern Thailand. Laboratory findings show elevated systemic markers of inflammation. Fungal infections, such as histoplasmosis, and mycobacterial infections should be considered. Biopsies of skin, abscesses, and lymph nodes should be sent for culture and histopathological studies. PCR and serological antigen tests can help accelerate the diagnosis. The patient was given an initial diagnosis of melioidosis, but histoplasmosis was confirmed by PCR and culture of a lymph node biopsy, which also showed fungal cells of H. capsulatum. Disseminated histoplasmosis is a potentially life-threatening condition that presents with fever, malaise, anorexia, and weight loss, and requires prompt treatment with liposomal amphotericin B.\nThis 20-year-old woman from the Democratic Republic of the Congo presents with acute febrile illness and disseminated uniform vesiculopustular skin rash including the palms and soles of the feet, as well as the oral mucosa. The lesions progress from macules to papules, vesicles, and pustules.

CNS involvement is common, with presentations including diffuse encephalopathy, reversible sensorineural deafness, and extrapyramidal manifestations. Diagnosis is challenging and often relies on clinical evidence, with serological tests available in some settings. Standard treatment is with doxycycline 100 mg bid for 1 week, and the disease is responsive to antibiotic treatment.\nStevens–Johnson syndrome (SJS) and toxic epidermal necrolysis (TEN) is a life-threatening mucocutaneous hypersensitivity reaction caused by drugs, characterized by non-specific symptoms such as flu-like symptoms, followed by a morbiliform rash, widespread apoptosis of keratinocytes, and epithelial necrosis. Clinically, it presents with a maculopapular rash, often accompanied by conjunctivitis, swollen and hemorrhagic lips, and difficulty eating, drinking, and talking. Differential diagnoses include staphylococcal scalded skin syndrome, toxic shock syndrome, exfoliative dermatitis, autoimmune bullous diseases, and acute paraneoplastic pemphigus. The diagnosis is often made clinically, but skin biopsies may be helpful. All potentially causative drugs need to be withdrawn immediately, and treatment is supportive, with no clear benefit of disease-modifying interventions such as systemic corticosteroids or IV immunoglobulins. The case fatality rate is up to 5% in SJS and 30% in TEN, with primary causes of death being infection and multi-organ failure.\nA 24-year-old woman from Uganda presents with a febrile illness, sore throat, abdominal pain, diarrhea, and bilateral conjunctivitis, with a history of her husband's recent death from a similar illness. The differential diagnoses include malaria, typhoid fever, invasive meningococcal disease, adenovirus, influenza, measles, Zika virus, and viral hemorrhagic fever (VHF), with Marburg virus disease being a key consideration given the husband's occupation in a gold mine. Testing should be done with caution, and samples should be sent to a specialized laboratory for PCR. The patient is treated with supportive care and resuscitation, and strict infection control measures should be followed.\nHantavirus Cardiopulmonary Syndrome (HCPS) primarily occurs in the border region between Chile and Argentina, and typically presents with non-specific prodromal symptoms followed by rapidly progressing respiratory failure and precipitous haemodynamic instability. The clinical course varies from a mild disease to its most severe form, HCPS, which is characterized by microvascular leakage and is mainly attributed to host immune response. Diagnosis is confirmed by RT-PCR from whole blood or by serology with presence of specific IgM antibodies or at least a 4-fold increase in IgG titres in paired samples. The mainstay of treatment is organ supportive therapy, and patients should be transferred to a tertiary intensive care unit immediately upon suspicion of ANDV infection. Important differential diagnoses include influenza, hantavirus infections, other respiratory viruses, pneumococcal pneumonia, rickettsial diseases, severe malaria, histoplasmosis, and cryptococcosis.\nA 23-year-old HIV-positive Zambian woman presented with a new-onset seizure. The clinical presentation included a single convulsive seizure lasting 5-10 minutes, without any focal neurological deficits. CSF examination was normal apart from a slightly raised protein level. Neuroimaging revealed hypodense lesions without contrast enhancement restricted to the subcortical white matter. EEG demonstrated focal slowing in the right hemisphere. The patient is at high risk of opportunistic CNS infections, including PML, which is the most likely underlying diagnosis. Important differential diagnoses include tuberculoma, cerebral toxoplasmosis, cryptococcoma, brain abscess and primary CNS lymphoma. The correct diagnosis is confirmed by detecting JC-virus DNA in the CSF, with a key laboratory finding of JC-virus DNA positivity. The management involves antiepileptic treatment with carbamazepine and ART, with supportive care to manage potential complications.\nThis patient, a 35-year-old Peruvian logger, presents with acute febrile illness that produces liver failure, jaundice, bleeding, encephalopathy, and seizures. The diagnosis is confirmed by IgM capture ELISA positivity for yellow fever virus, which is a flavivirus transmitted by Aedes and Haemagogus mosquitoes.

         "Text": "A 27-year-old man presents to a hospital in Europe with a 2-day history of high fevers, malaise, myalgias, and severe headache which developed 3 days after a 2-week trip to Uganda. While there, the man tracked chimpanzees and gorillas, and visited the Marangambo Forest python cave. Fruit bats were flying in and out of the cave, but he was not touched, bitten, or scratched by the bats. Later, he ate goat stew containing intestine at a local hotel and swam in a local lake. No one fell ill during the trip. The man developed fever 12 days after visiting the python cave, 11 days after eating goat stew, and 10 days after lake swimming. Prior to travel, he was vaccinated against hepatitis A, polio, typhoid, and yellow fever. He took doxycycline as malaria prophylaxis, but admits to missing a couple of doses. At presentation, physical examination is normal except for a temperature of 40.1°C (104.2°F) and relative bradycardia (79 beats per minute). Based on his exposure history and the pulse-temperature dissociation, typhoid fever is diagnosed and ceftriaxone begun. Blood examination demonstrates mild leukopenia (2.9 x 10⁹ cells/L), moderate thrombocytopenia (66 x 10⁹ cells/L) and mildly elevated alanine aminotransferase (146 U/L) and aspartate aminotransferase (137 U/L). Rapid diagnostic testing for malaria is negative.  On hospital day 2, the man develops profuse watery diarrhoea, nausea, and vomiting, and viral gastroenteritides are considered. Repeat lab testing demonstrates acute liver failure with liver enzymes >400 U/L. Creatinine is elevated at 2.1 mg/dL. The patient develops severe abdominal pain and a maculopapular rash, which generalises over 2 days.",

      "answer": "The final diagnosis for this patient is Typhoid fever. The clinical presentation of high fever (40.1°C), severe headache, myalgias, and abdominal pain, along with the development of acute liver failure and severe abdominal pain, is highly characteristic of typhoid. The pulse-temperature dissociation (79 bpm, 40.1°C) is a classic finding. The negative malaria rapid diagnostic test and the progression to acute liver failure, despite initial broad-spectrum antibiotics, definitively ruled out malaria and other causes of fever and jaundice. The history of travel to Uganda, exposure to bats, and consumption of potentially contaminated food and water strongly supports an enteric infection, and the patient's vaccination history against typhoid makes it a plausible diagnosis.",

The clinical features include pale mucous membranes, right upper quadrant tenderness, and a liver span of 15 cm. The patient has pronounced eosinophilia and multiple hypodense non-enhancing hepatic lesions on CT scan. Clinically, the patient is diagnosed with fascioliasis, an infection caused by the liver flukes Fasciola hepatica. The differential diagnoses include pyogenic liver abscess, amoebic liver abscess, brucellosis, visceral toxocariasis, and secondary infections. The most useful investigation to establish the diagnosis is serology, specifically the Fas2 ELISA, which detects antibodies to Fasciola hepatica. The definitive diagnosis is based on the microscopic detection of eggs in stool. Treatments with a single dose of 10mg/kg Triclabendazole are usually effective\nHantavirus Cardiopulmonary Syndrome (HCPS) primarily occurs in the border region between Chile and Argentina, and typically presents with non-specific prodromal symptoms followed by rapidly progressing respiratory failure and precipitous haemodynamic instability. The clinical course varies from a mild disease to its most severe form, HCPS, which is characterized by microvascular leakage and is mainly attributed to host immune response. Diagnosis is confirmed by RT-PCR from whole blood or by serology with presence of specific IgM antibodies or at least a 4-fold increase in IgG titres in paired samples. The mainstay of treatment is organ supportive therapy, and patients should be transferred to a tertiary intensive care unit immediately upon suspicion of ANDV infection. Important differential diagnoses include influenza, hantavirus infections, other respiratory viruses, pneumococcal pneumonia, rickettsial diseases, severe malaria, histoplasmosis, and cryptococcosis.\nThis patient, a 35-year-old Peruvian logger, presents with acute febrile illness that produces liver failure, jaundice, bleeding, encephalopathy, and seizures.

The diagnosis is confirmed by detection of yellow fever virus through IgM capture ELISA, supported by relevant epidemiological exposure to the virus.\nHyperreactive malarial splenomegaly (HMS) is a condition that primarily occurs in tropical regions with stable malaria transmission, characterized by massive splenomegaly and hypersplenism due to an abnormal immune response to repeated infections with Plasmodium species. Clinical presentation may include symptoms of anemia, abdominal heaviness or discomfort, and episodes of low-grade fever. Laboratory findings typically include anemia, bi- or pancytopenia, and elevated IgM levels. Key diagnostic findings include splenomegaly, elevated antimalarial antibodies, and a favorable response to antimalarial prophylaxis. Important differential diagnoses include lymphoma, chronic myeloid leukemia, myelofibrosis, hemoglobinopathies, schistosomiasis, and visceral leishmaniasis. Treatment involves antimalarial prophylaxis for the duration of exposure, and repeated courses may not be required even after clearance of infection.\nA previously healthy 20-year-old man from southern India presents with fever and rapidly progressive quadriparesis a month after being bitten by a dog. He had received a full course of five active anti-rabies vaccinations but no anti-rabies immunoglobulin. Laboratory confirmation was secured through testing at least three saliva samples at 3- to 6-hour intervals, along with a nuchal skin biopsy for viral RNA by RT-PCR. The diagnosis is confirmed by detection of rabies virus RNA using RT-PCR from saliva or nuchal skin biopsy. Important differential diagnoses include Guillain Barré Syndrome, post-vaccination encephalomyelitis, and other conditions as listed in Table 91.1. The patient did not receive RIG, which could have possibly prevented rabies in this case.\nThe patient presents with skin lesions and breathlessness, which are typical for Kaposi's sarcoma (KS), particularly in a newly diagnosed HIV-infected patient. Important differential diagnoses include tuberculosis, which should be vigorously excluded due to the chronic history of cough. The diagnosis of cutaneous disease is often made by clinical appearance, though biopsy is recommended.\nThe patient, a 51-year-old female traveller, presents with a generalized maculopapular rash, bilateral conjunctivitis, peripheral painful oedema (hands, elbows, knees, and feet), and generalized lymphadenopathy.

      "ground_truth": "The patient’s acute febrile illness rapidly progressed to severe systemic and hemorrhagic manifestations, including vomiting, confusion, seizures, haematemesis, and epistaxis. His occupation as a miner in Angola places him at high risk due to exposure to bat-inhabited caves and mines, a known reservoir for Marburg virus. The combination of epidemiologic risk, hemorrhagic features, and neurological involvement strongly supports Marburg virus disease.",
      "answer": "The final diagnosis for this 29-year-old Angolan miner is severe malaria, specifically Plasmodium falciparum, complicated by severe malaria manifestations including acute kidney injury (indicated by elevated creatinine 144.8 μmol/L, up from 74.4 μmol/L), severe anaemia (Hb 6.8 g/dL), and acute liver failure (elevated AST 104 U/L, ALT 114 U/L, ALP 244 U/L, total bilirubin 111.2 μmol/L). This diagnosis is supported by the patient's history of mining in an endemic area, exposure to contaminated water, and the progression of symptoms despite initial treatment.",
      "contexts": "Knowlesi malaria primarily affects individuals traveling to or living in Southeast Asia and is characterized by quotidian fever, high parasitemias, and severe disease manifestations. Important differential diagnoses include dengue fever, chikungunya, Zika, influenza, acute HIV infection, enteric fever, and non-falciparum malaria. Diagnosis of Knowlesi malaria involves microscopy (thick and thin films) showing Plasmodium species trophozoites, confirmed by species-specific polymerase chain reaction (PCR), with treatment involving atovaquone/proguanil for 3 days.\nHyperreactive malarial splenomegaly (HMS) is a condition that primarily occurs in tropical regions with stable malaria transmission, characterized by massive splenomegaly and hypersplenism due to an abnormal immune response to repeated infections with Plasmodium species.

A key feature of leprosy  includes one or more hypopigmented anaesthetic skin patches and thickened peripheral nerves. Leprosy is categorized based on the number of skin lesions, which determines the duration of treatment. Clinically, tuberculoid leprosy or borderline tuberculoid leprosy occurs with high cell-mediated immunity against M. leprae, whereas, lepromatous leprosy without an adequate cell-mediated response presents with many skin lesions. The diagnosis is largely clinical without reliable diagnostic or screening tests. Treatment of leprosy involves multidrug therapy with at least 3 drugs, often involving rifampicin, clofazimine, and dapsone, which varies in duration based on the classification, from 6 months in paucibacillary leprosy to 12 months in multibacillary leprosy. Additional investigations like skin biopsy and slit-skin smear can be performed to support the diagnosis. Leprosy awareness campaigns emphasize the importance of consulting healthcare professionals for pale patches causing reduced sensation, as leprosy is a significant public health issue in endemic countries.\nA 46-year-old Thai woman presents with a 2-month history of recurrent and treatment-refractory cutaneous and subcutaneous abscesses, progressive lymphadenopathy, and weight loss. Symptoms started 6-8 weeks after returning from a visit to northern Thailand. Laboratory findings show elevated systemic markers of inflammation. Fungal infections, such as histoplasmosis, and mycobacterial infections should be considered. Biopsies of skin, abscesses, and lymph nodes should be sent for culture and histopathological studies. PCR and serological antigen tests can help accelerate the diagnosis. The patient was given an initial diagnosis of melioidosis, but histoplasmosis was confirmed by PCR and culture of a lymph node biopsy, which also showed fungal cells of H. capsulatum. Disseminated histoplasmosis is a potentially life-threatening condition that presents with fever, malaise, anorexia, and weight loss, and requires prompt treatment with liposomal amphotericin B.\nThis 20-year-old woman from the Democratic Republic of the Congo presents with acute febrile illness and disseminated uniform vesiculopustular skin rash including the palms and soles of the feet, as well as the oral mucosa.

The diagnosis is confirmed by IgM capture ELISA positivity for yellow fever virus, which is a flavivirus transmitted by Aedes and Haemagogus mosquitoes. The symptoms presented include fever, jaundice, coffee-ground vomiting, gross hematuria, and mental obtundation. Clinically, it is characterized by rapid progression to gastrointestinal illness, dehydration, and multiorgan dysfunction. Important differential diagnoses include severe malaria, viral hepatitis, toxin-mediated hepatitis, leptospirosis, and dengue hemorrhagic fever. The diagnosis is confirmed by detection of yellow fever virus through IgM capture ELISA, supported by relevant epidemiological exposure to the virus.\nA 24-year-old woman from Uganda presents with a febrile illness, sore throat, abdominal pain, diarrhea, and bilateral conjunctivitis, with a history of her husband's recent death from a similar illness. The differential diagnoses include malaria, typhoid fever, invasive meningococcal disease, adenovirus, influenza, measles, Zika virus, and viral hemorrhagic fever (VHF), with Marburg virus disease being a key consideration given the husband's occupation in a gold mine. Testing should be done with caution, and samples should be sent to a specialized laboratory for PCR. The patient is treated with supportive care and resuscitation, and strict infection control measures should be followed.\nThe patient, a 51-year-old female traveller, presents with a generalized maculopapular rash, bilateral conjunctivitis, peripheral painful oedema (hands, elbows, knees, and feet), and generalized lymphadenopathy. This presentation is suggestive of an arboviral infection, particularly Zika virus infection. Key findings to diagnose this exact disease include: detection of viral RNA, viral antigen, or specific IgM in blood samples, and seroconversion (rise in IgG) in paired serum samples. The patient's diagnosis was confirmed by PCR and seroconversion, with a rise in anti-Zika IgM and IgG titres.\nEosinophilic meningitis, primarily occurring in South-east Asia and the Pacific basin, typically presents with headache and parasesthesia of the trunk, limbs, or face. Clinically, it is characterized by a migratory subcutaneous swelling, creeping eruption, and sharp radicular pain at onset. Important differential diagnoses include fungal meningitis with Coccidioides immitis, lymphoma, eosinophilic leukemia, sarcoid, and idiopathic hypereosinophilic syndrome. Diagnosis is confirmed by the presence of ten or more eosinophils per microliter of CSF, or eosinophilia of at least 10% of the total CSF leukocyte count, and Western blot showing specific antibodies against the 31 kD Angiostrongylus cantonensis antigen. Treatment is symptomatic and may involve corticosteroids and antiparasitic drugs.\nThe patient, a 55-year-old female pig farmer, presented with fever, headache, vomiting, confusion, tachycardia, hypotension, and a non-blanching purpuric rash. The rapid progression to shock and severe neurological symptoms suggests acute bacterial meningitis. The most likely diagnosis is Streptococcus suis meningitis, confirmed by cerebrospinal fluid culture. The differential diagnoses include other forms of bacterial meningitis, melioidosis, and dengue fever. The key finding to diagnose this disease is the presence of a non-blanching purpuric rash and severe neurological symptoms in a patient with a history of contact with pigs. Lab tests, including cerebrospinal fluid culture and PCR, are crucial for confirming the diagnosis. The treatment is ceftriaxone, with adjunctive corticosteroids reducing the risk of deafness.\nAfrican tick-bite fever primarily occurs in sub-Saharan Africa and typically presents with fever, myalgias, headache, and a characteristic inoculation eschar at the site of the bite with local lymphadenopathy. Clinically, it is characterized by flu-like symptoms with a characteristic eschar. Important differential diagnoses include malaria. The diagnosis is confirmed by PCR from the eschar scab or other diagnostic methods. Treatment may not be necessary in mild cases, but doxycycline 100mg bid PO for 3 to 7 days may be given and alternative options are macrolides for pregnant women and children younger than 8 years of age.\nThe patient, a 51-year-old female traveller, presents with a generalized maculopapular rash, bilateral conjunctivitis, peripheral painful oedema (hands, elbows, knees, and feet), and generalized lymphadenopathy. This presentation is suggestive of an arboviral infection, particularly Zika virus infection.

The patient's diagnosis was confirmed by PCR and seroconversion, with a rise in anti-Zika IgM and IgG titres.\nA 23-year-old HIV-positive Zambian woman presented with a new-onset seizure. The clinical presentation included a single convulsive seizure lasting 5-10 minutes, without any focal neurological deficits. CSF examination was normal apart from a slightly raised protein level. Neuroimaging revealed hypodense lesions without contrast enhancement restricted to the subcortical white matter. EEG demonstrated focal slowing in the right hemisphere. The patient is at high risk of opportunistic CNS infections, including PML, which is the most likely underlying diagnosis. Important differential diagnoses include tuberculoma, cerebral toxoplasmosis, cryptococcoma, brain abscess and primary CNS lymphoma. The correct diagnosis is confirmed by detecting JC-virus DNA in the CSF, with a key laboratory finding of JC-virus DNA positivity. The management involves antiepileptic treatment with carbamazepine and ART, with supportive care to manage potential complications.\nThe patient presents with skin lesions and breathlessness, which are typical for Kaposi's sarcoma (KS), particularly in a newly diagnosed HIV-infected patient. Important differential diagnoses include tuberculosis, which should be vigorously excluded due to the chronic history of cough. The diagnosis of cutaneous disease is often made by clinical appearance, though biopsy is recommended.\nA 46-year-old Thai woman presents with a 2-month history of recurrent and treatment-refractory cutaneous and subcutaneous abscesses, progressive lymphadenopathy, and weight loss. Symptoms started 6-8 weeks after returning from a visit to northern Thailand. Laboratory findings show elevated systemic markers of inflammation. Fungal infections, such as histoplasmosis, and mycobacterial infections should be considered. Biopsies of skin, abscesses, and lymph nodes should be sent for culture and histopathological studies. PCR and serological antigen tests can help accelerate the diagnosis. The patient was given an initial diagnosis of melioidosis, but histoplasmosis was confirmed by PCR and culture of a lymph node biopsy, which also showed fungal cells of H. capsulatum. Disseminated histoplasmosis is a potentially life-threatening condition that presents with fever, malaise, anorexia, and weight loss, and requires prompt treatment with liposomal amphotericin B.\nBurkitt's lymphoma primarily occurs in areas with holoendemic malaria, typically presents with a painless, rapidly progressive proptosis of the eye without vision impairment. Clinically, it is characterized by rapid cell doubling every 24 to 48 hours and associated with the Epstein-Barr virus. Important differential diagnoses include rhabdomyosarcoma, B-cell lymphoma. The diagnosis is confirmed by fine-needle aspirate or biopsy, with further investigations including abdominal ultrasound, cytospun sample of cerebrospinal fluid, and bone marrow aspirate. The key finding to diagnose this disease is the presence of monomorphic tumour cells with intermediate size, indistinct nuclei, and coarse chromatin on histological examination.\nYaws is a chronic infectious disease caused by Treponema pallidum subspecies pertenue. It primarily presents with a painless, non-healing leg ulcer, which can eventually develop into a nodule that ulcerates. The ulcer is usually accompanied by arthralgias, malaise, and early osteoperiostitis. The diagnosis is based on serology using treponemal and non-treponemal tests, with RPR being a common non-treponemal test. Differential diagnoses include other skin lesions caused by bacteria such as Haemophilus ducreyi. The treatment of choice is benzathine benzylpenicillin or azithromycin. A four-fold fall in the RPR titre over 6 months is considered to indicate cure.\nKnowlesi malaria primarily affects individuals traveling to or living in Southeast Asia and is characterized by quotidian fever, high parasitemias, and severe disease manifestations. Important differential diagnoses include dengue fever, chikungunya, Zika, influenza, acute HIV infection, enteric fever, and non-falciparum malaria.

Key findings to diagnose this exact disease include: detection of viral RNA, viral antigen, or specific IgM in blood samples, and seroconversion (rise in IgG) in paired serum samples. The patient's diagnosis was confirmed by PCR and seroconversion, with a rise in anti-Zika IgM and IgG titres.\nLeprosy is characterized by a pale or hypopigmented macule skin lesion often located on a distal peripheral area which may accompany neuropathic symptoms. A key feature of leprosy  includes one or more hypopigmented anaesthetic skin patches and thickened peripheral nerves. Leprosy is categorized based on the number of skin lesions, which determines the duration of treatment. Clinically, tuberculoid leprosy or borderline tuberculoid leprosy occurs with high cell-mediated immunity against M. leprae, whereas, lepromatous leprosy without an adequate cell-mediated response presents with many skin lesions. The diagnosis is largely clinical without reliable diagnostic or screening tests. Treatment of leprosy involves multidrug therapy with at least 3 drugs, often involving rifampicin, clofazimine, and dapsone, which varies in duration based on the classification, from 6 months in paucibacillary leprosy to 12 months in multibacillary leprosy. Additional investigations like skin biopsy and slit-skin smear can be performed to support the diagnosis. Leprosy awareness campaigns emphasize the importance of consulting healthcare professionals for pale patches causing reduced sensation, as leprosy is a significant public health issue in endemic countries.\nA 46-year-old Thai woman presents with a 2-month history of recurrent and treatment-refractory cutaneous and subcutaneous abscesses, progressive lymphadenopathy, and weight loss. Symptoms started 6-8 weeks after returning from a visit to northern Thailand. Laboratory findings show elevated systemic markers of inflammation.

The lesions progress from macules to papules, vesicles, and pustules. The main differential diagnoses include monkeypox, smallpox, cowpox, and varicella, with important criteria to distinguish between them including distribution of skin lesions, stage of lesion development, involvement of palms and soles, presence of fever, and lymphadenopathy.\nThe patient, a 51-year-old female traveller, presents with a generalized maculopapular rash, bilateral conjunctivitis, peripheral painful oedema (hands, elbows, knees, and feet), and generalized lymphadenopathy. This presentation is suggestive of an arboviral infection, particularly Zika virus infection. Key findings to diagnose this exact disease include: detection of viral RNA, viral antigen, or specific IgM in blood samples, and seroconversion (rise in IgG) in paired serum samples. The patient's diagnosis was confirmed by PCR and seroconversion, with a rise in anti-Zika IgM and IgG titres.\nScrub typhus primarily occurs in the Asia-Pacific region and is transmitted by the bite of an infected larva (chigger) of a trombiculid mite. Infected patients typically present with fever, severe headache, myalgia, regional or generalized lymphadenopathy, and a macular or maculopapular rash. CNS involvement is common, with presentations including diffuse encephalopathy, reversible sensorineural deafness, and extrapyramidal manifestations. Diagnosis is challenging and often relies on clinical evidence, with serological tests available in some settings. Standard treatment is with doxycycline 100 mg bid for 1 week, and the disease is responsive to antibiotic treatment.\nBrucellosis is a common zoonotic bacterial infection that primarily presents as a non-focal febrile illness with symptoms such as night sweats, fatigue, lymphadenopathy, and hepatosplenomegaly. Localized infection can develop, affecting the musculoskeletal, genitourinary, central nervous, or cardiovascular system, with osteoarticular involvement being particularly common, often presenting as peripheral arthritis, sacroiliitis, or spondylitis. The diagnosis is confirmed by isolation of the causative agent, Brucella melitensis, from blood or tissue samples. The disease is treatable with a combination of antimicrobials, such as doxycycline and rifampicin, for a prolonged course of 6-12 weeks or more, depending on the organ manifestation and severity. Important differential diagnoses include spinal tuberculosis, and the disease is more common in highly endemic countries like Afghanistan.\nKnowlesi malaria primarily affects individuals traveling to or living in Southeast Asia and is characterized by quotidian fever, high parasitemias, and severe disease manifestations. Important differential diagnoses include dengue fever, chikungunya, Zika, influenza, acute HIV infection, enteric fever, and non-falciparum malaria.

         "Text": "A 28 years old female Cook, from Eastern Nigeria who recently relocated to Ikoyi waterside, Lagos state visited the Nigerian Army Eye Centre Lagos on the 21st of February 2020. The presenting complains were itching,  gritty and  foreign body sensation  in the right eye. There was no family history of ocular or medical condition. On examination with Snellen acuity, the unaided distant, visual acuity in the right eye was 6/12 and left eye was 6/9 and near visual acuity was N5 at 40cm. Pinhole visual acuity improved to 6/6 in both eyes and preliminary external examination using penlight showed smooth ocular motility, a clear conjuctiva, clear cornea and a normal pupillary  reex. Contact  tonometry using perkins applanation tonometer revealed 16mmHg and 15mmHg in the right  and left  eye respectively.  The blood  pressure was 100/80mmHg and pulse rate of  60b/min. Random  blood sugar was 88mg/dL. A funduscopy examination revealed a cup to disc ratio of 0.2 and normal blood vessels and macula in  both eyes. The anterior segment examination under slit lamp biomicroscope conrmed the anterior segment of the eye to be normal but revealed the presence of a live adult nematode worm estimated to be about 450 mm in length with a diameter of 0.5 mm visible in the lateral subconjunctival space  of the  right eye while posterior segment examination was essentially normal. Attempts to remove the worm with toothless forceps was not  successful particularly because the patient was  apprehensive. Following  assessment, she was prescribed Bethamesone + Neomycin () eyedrop 1drop 3x daily for use on the right eye and follow up was scheduled the next day. On return to clinic next day being 22nd February 2020, the patient was  less apprehensive after  counselling. Surgical  procedure under local topical anesthesia was conducted and the worm was successfully removed. Chloramphenicol ointment was  inserted on the right eye and padded to be reviewed in 4 days.",

The diagnosis is often made clinically, but skin biopsies may be helpful. All potentially causative drugs need to be withdrawn immediately, and treatment is supportive, with no clear benefit of disease-modifying interventions such as systemic corticosteroids or IV immunoglobulins. The case fatality rate is up to 5% in SJS and 30% in TEN, with primary causes of death being infection and multi-organ failure.\nA generalized, non-itchy rash is a primary symptom, which could be a manifestation of secondary syphilis. Clinical findings include a generalized rash involving the palms of the hands, without lymphadenopathy, anemia, or jaundice. The key finding for diagnosis is positive treponemal serological test for syphilis, ideally with RPR titre of 1:8, which is a common differential diagnosis in pregnant women with a rash. The disease may cause various congenital syphilis symptoms in the baby including a generalized bullous rash, jaundice and hepatosplenomegaly. Diagnosis is confirmed by treating with intramuscular benzathine penicillin.\nThe patient is a 37-year-old woman from Malawi with haematemesis, presenting with splenomegaly, pancytopenia, and normocytic anemia. The most likely cause of her haematemesis is upper gastrointestinal bleeding due to gastro-oesophageal varices secondary to portal hypertension. Important differential diagnoses include peptic ulcer disease, erosive gastritis, bleeding tumours, oesophageal cancer, and visceral leishmaniasis. The diagnosis is confirmed by gastroduodenoscopy showing oesophageal varices. Laboratory findings indicate a low white blood cell count and platelet count, and the patient has a negative Hepatitis B and C serology. Key features to diagnose this disease include the presence of splenomegaly, pancytopenia, and pipestem fibrosis on ultrasound of the liver.\nThe patient, a 51-year-old female traveller, presents with a generalized maculopapular rash, bilateral conjunctivitis, peripheral painful oedema (hands, elbows, knees, and feet), and generalized lymphadenopathy. This presentation is suggestive of an arboviral infection, particularly Zika virus infection. Key findings to diagnose this exact disease include: detection of viral RNA, viral antigen, or specific IgM in blood samples, and seroconversion (rise in IgG) in paired serum samples. The patient's diagnosis was confirmed by PCR and seroconversion, with a rise in anti-Zika IgM and IgG titres.\nA 24-year-old woman from Uganda presents with a febrile illness, sore throat, abdominal pain, diarrhea, and bilateral conjunctivitis, with a history of her husband's recent death from a similar illness. The differential diagnoses include malaria, typhoid fever, invasive meningococcal disease, adenovirus, influenza, measles, Zika virus, and viral hemorrhagic fever (VHF), with Marburg virus disease being a key consideration given the husband's occupation in a gold mine. Testing should be done with caution, and samples should be sent to a specialized laboratory for PCR. The patient is treated with supportive care and resuscitation, and strict infection control measures should be followed.\nThe patient, a 55-year-old female pig farmer, presented with fever, headache, vomiting, confusion, tachycardia, hypotension, and a non-blanching purpuric rash. The rapid progression to shock and severe neurological symptoms suggests acute bacterial meningitis. The most likely diagnosis is Streptococcus suis meningitis, confirmed by cerebrospinal fluid culture. The differential diagnoses include other forms of bacterial meningitis, melioidosis, and dengue fever. The key finding to diagnose this disease is the presence of a non-blanching purpuric rash and severe neurological symptoms in a patient with a history of contact with pigs. Lab tests, including cerebrospinal fluid culture and PCR, are crucial for confirming the diagnosis. The treatment is ceftriaxone, with adjunctive corticosteroids reducing the risk of deafness.\nThis patient, a 35-year-old Peruvian logger, presents with acute febrile illness that produces liver failure, jaundice, bleeding, encephalopathy, and seizures. The diagnosis is confirmed by IgM capture ELISA positivity for yellow fever virus, which is a flavivirus transmitted by Aedes and Haemagogus mosquitoes. The symptoms presented include fever, jaundice, coffee-ground vomiting, gross hematuria, and mental obtundation. Clinically, it is characterized by rapid progression to gastrointestinal illness, dehydration, and multiorgan dysfunction. Important differential diagnoses include severe malaria, viral hepatitis, toxin-mediated hepatitis, leptospirosis, and dengue hemorrhagic fever. The diagnosis is confirmed by detection of yellow fever virus through IgM capture ELISA, supported by relevant epidemiological exposure to the virus.\nNeurolathyrism is a preventable toxic myelopathy caused by excessive ingestion of the Lathyrus sativus grass pea, primarily affecting young male farmers in drought-prone areas. The clinical presentation includes irreversible acute to subacute spastic paraparesis or quadriparesis without prominent sensory involvement. Diagnosis is based on history of consumption of Lathyrus sativus, absence of other causes of myelopathy, and elimination of other differential diagnoses. The diagnosis is supported by laboratory tests such as full blood count, liver and renal function tests, cerebrospinal fluid, nerve conduction studies, and electromyography, which are normal. The differential diagnoses include HTLV-associated myelopathy, neurocassavism, and compressive myelopathy. The management of neurolathyrism is symptomatic and includes the use of anti-spastic drugs, physiotherapy, and tendon and muscle release surgery. Education to avoid consumption of Lathyrus sativus and measures to reduce toxin burden are important public health interventions.\nThe patient presents with signs and symptoms of left ventricular heart failure, hypertension, and anaemia. He has bilateral renal angle tenderness and his kidneys appear enlarged, with high creatinine levels and hyperkalaemia. He is a fisherman from Lake Malawi and has been in contact with Schistosoma haematobium-infested water, making chronic schistosomiasis with hydronephrosis a top differential diagnosis. Ultrasound shows bilateral hydronephrosis, and cystoscopy reveals hyperaemic mucosa with 'sandy patches' suggestive of granulomatous lesions. The diagnosis is confirmed by imaging and cystoscopy findings, and the patient undergoes treatment and management for late-stage urogenital schistosomiasis.\nYaws is a chronic infectious disease caused by Treponema pallidum subspecies pertenue. It primarily presents with a painless, non-healing leg ulcer, which can eventually develop into a nodule that ulcerates. The ulcer is usually accompanied by arthralgias, malaise, and early osteoperiostitis. The diagnosis is based on serology using treponemal and non-treponemal tests, with RPR being a common non-treponemal test. Differential diagnoses include other skin lesions caused by bacteria such as Haemophilus ducreyi. The treatment of choice is benzathine benzylpenicillin or azithromycin. A four-fold fall in the RPR titre over 6 months is considered to indicate cure.\n"

         "Text": "A 48-year-old woman with no underlying disease presented with hyperpigmented lesions on her back for 2 years. She felt numbness at the tip of her fingers and toes for 4 days, but denied contact with any chemicals. Thirty years ago, she spent a week at her father-in-law's house after he was diagnosed with leprosy. No other family members or relatives showed symptom. Skin examination revealed asymmetrical, multiple, discrete, poorly defined borders and hyperpigmented plaques with decreased sensation on her back, nose, and both cheeks, loss of the outer two-thirds of both eyebrows, and infiltrated plaques on both earlobes. Neurological examination revealed a decrease in sensation of pain and temperature at the tips of her fingers and toes. Other physical examinations and peripheral nerve findings were unremarkable. At this stage, the provisional diagnosis of the patient's illness was leprosy. We then obtained slit skin smears of both earlobes and plaques of the skin on her back. Acid-fast staining of the samples revealed the presence of acid-fast stained bacilli  in all slit skin samples.",

      },
      "ground_truth": "The patient was diagnosed with leprosy as all three cardinal signs of the WHO diagnostic criteria were met. The generalised distribution of plaques on the face, trunk, and eyebrows was compatible with lepromatous leprosy. According to the WHO guideline for leprosy treatment",
      "answer": "The final diagnosis for this 48-year-old woman is leprosy. The presence of hyperpigmented skin lesions, peripheral sensory neuropathy, and the history of exposure to leprosy in her family, along with the positive findings of acid-fast bacilli in the skin smears from her earlobes and back, definitively established the diagnosis of leprosy. This diagnosis is consistent with her presenting symptoms of numbness in her extremities and the observed skin changes.",
      "contexts": "A 46-year-old Thai woman presents with a 2-month history of recurrent and treatment-refractory cutaneous and subcutaneous abscesses, progressive lymphadenopathy, and weight loss. Symptoms started 6-8 weeks after returning from a visit to northern Thailand. Laboratory findings show elevated systemic markers of inflammation. Fungal infections, such as histoplasmosis, and mycobacterial infections should be considered. Biopsies of skin, abscesses, and lymph nodes should be sent for culture and histopathological studies. PCR and serological antigen tests can help accelerate the diagnosis. The patient was given an initial diagnosis of melioidosis, but histoplasmosis was confirmed by PCR and culture of a lymph node biopsy, which also showed fungal cells of H. capsulatum. Disseminated histoplasmosis is a potentially life-threatening condition that presents with fever, malaise, anorexia, and weight loss, and requires prompt treatment with liposomal amphotericin B.\nA 24-year-old woman from Uganda presents with a febrile illness, sore throat, abdominal pain, diarrhea, and bilateral conjunctivitis, with a history of her husband's recent death from a similar illness.

Education to avoid consumption of Lathyrus sativus and measures to reduce toxin burden are important public health interventions.\nStevens–Johnson syndrome (SJS) and toxic epidermal necrolysis (TEN) is a life-threatening mucocutaneous hypersensitivity reaction caused by drugs, characterized by non-specific symptoms such as flu-like symptoms, followed by a morbiliform rash, widespread apoptosis of keratinocytes, and epithelial necrosis. Clinically, it presents with a maculopapular rash, often accompanied by conjunctivitis, swollen and hemorrhagic lips, and difficulty eating, drinking, and talking. Differential diagnoses include staphylococcal scalded skin syndrome, toxic shock syndrome, exfoliative dermatitis, autoimmune bullous diseases, and acute paraneoplastic pemphigus. The diagnosis is often made clinically, but skin biopsies may be helpful. All potentially causative drugs need to be withdrawn immediately, and treatment is supportive, with no clear benefit of disease-modifying interventions such as systemic corticosteroids or IV immunoglobulins. The case fatality rate is up to 5% in SJS and 30% in TEN, with primary causes of death being infection and multi-organ failure.\nLeprosy is characterized by a pale or hypopigmented macule skin lesion often located on a distal peripheral area which may accompany neuropathic symptoms. A key feature of leprosy  includes one or more hypopigmented anaesthetic skin patches and thickened peripheral nerves. Leprosy is categorized based on the number of skin lesions, which determines the duration of treatment. Clinically, tuberculoid leprosy or borderline tuberculoid leprosy occurs with high cell-mediated immunity against M. leprae, whereas, lepromatous leprosy without an adequate cell-mediated response presents with many skin lesions. The diagnosis is largely clinical without reliable diagnostic or screening tests. Treatment of leprosy involves multidrug therapy with at least 3 drugs, often involving rifampicin, clofazimine, and dapsone, which varies in duration based on the classification, from 6 months in paucibacillary leprosy to 12 months in multibacillary leprosy. Additional investigations like skin biopsy and slit-skin smear can be performed to support the diagnosis. Leprosy awareness campaigns emphasize the importance of consulting healthcare professionals for pale patches causing reduced sensation, as leprosy is a significant public health issue in endemic countries.\nLeprosy is characterized by a pale or hypopigmented macule skin lesion often located on a distal peripheral area which may accompany neuropathic symptoms.

The diagnosis is confirmed by detection of yellow fever virus through IgM capture ELISA, supported by relevant epidemiological exposure to the virus.\nChagas disease is an anthropozoonosis caused by the protozoan T. cruzi, primarily transmitted in Latin America by triatomine bugs, but in non-endemic countries, it is mainly transmitted through mother-to-child transmission, blood transfusions or transplants. The chronic phase is usually asymptomatic but can progress to organ involvement, predominantly affecting the heart, with manifestations including bradycardia, ventricular arrhythmias, and dilated cardiomyopathy, and the gastrointestinal tract, with megaoesophagus and megacolon. Diagnosis is by direct visualization of trypomastigotes in the acute phase or serological testing in the chronic phase. Treatment is with trypanocidal drugs, benznidazole or nifurtimox, but is often associated with adverse events. Important differential diagnoses include vector-borne diseases such as malaria and dengue fever. The diagnosis is confirmed by Trypanosoma cruzi serology using two different testing methods along with the patient's history and exposure to triatomine bugs. \nKwashiorkor is a form of severe acute malnutrition characterized by reduced albumin levels, leading to oedema. It typically presents with skin and hair changes, apathy, and is often preceded by a severe infection. Key features include hypoalbuminaemia, generalized oedema, hair depigmentation, and poor wound healing. Important differential diagnoses include nephrotic syndrome, which is distinguished by heavy proteinuria and high urine albumin-to-creatinine ratio. The diagnosis is confirmed by serum albumin levels below 3.0 g/dL, clinical assessment, and the absence of heavy proteinuria. Management involves careful feeding with increased protein and calorie intake, prophylactic antibiotics, and close monitoring of fluid and electrolyte status.\nThe disease primarily occurs in the Amazonian rainforest and typically presents with acute febrile illness lasting 3-7 days, characterized by chills, headache, retro-orbital and epigastric pain, myalgia, arthralgia, nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, and a maculopapular rash, sometimes followed by desquamation. Haemorrhagic manifestations are rare. Prolonged polyarthralgias, which are suspected to arise from the inflammatory immune response stimulated by the prolonged virus persistence in joint tissues, can occur after the initial fever resolves. Important differential diagnoses include reactive arthritis, viral arthritis, and other alphavirus infections. The diagnosis is confirmed by detection of Mayaro virus RNA using PCR in blood or, beyond the acute phase, by serological detection of specific IgM and IgG antibodies against the Mayaro virus, using a two-step approach with highly sensitive screening assays followed by highly specific confirmatory assays.\nThe patient, a 51-year-old female traveller, presents with a generalized maculopapular rash, bilateral conjunctivitis, peripheral painful oedema (hands, elbows, knees, and feet), and generalized lymphadenopathy.

The patient's diagnosis was confirmed by PCR and seroconversion, with a rise in anti-Zika IgM and IgG titres.\nA generalized, non-itchy rash is a primary symptom, which could be a manifestation of secondary syphilis. Clinical findings include a generalized rash involving the palms of the hands, without lymphadenopathy, anemia, or jaundice. The key finding for diagnosis is positive treponemal serological test for syphilis, ideally with RPR titre of 1:8, which is a common differential diagnosis in pregnant women with a rash. The disease may cause various congenital syphilis symptoms in the baby including a generalized bullous rash, jaundice and hepatosplenomegaly. Diagnosis is confirmed by treating with intramuscular benzathine penicillin.\nA generalized, non-itchy rash is a primary symptom, which could be a manifestation of secondary syphilis.

This presentation is suggestive of an arboviral infection, particularly Zika virus infection. Key findings to diagnose this exact disease include: detection of viral RNA, viral antigen, or specific IgM in blood samples, and seroconversion (rise in IgG) in paired serum samples. The patient's diagnosis was confirmed by PCR and seroconversion, with a rise in anti-Zika IgM and IgG titres.\nThis 20-year-old woman from the Democratic Republic of the Congo presents with acute febrile illness and disseminated uniform vesiculopustular skin rash including the palms and soles of the feet, as well as the oral mucosa. The lesions progress from macules to papules, vesicles, and pustules. The main differential diagnoses include monkeypox, smallpox, cowpox, and varicella, with important criteria to distinguish between them including distribution of skin lesions, stage of lesion development, involvement of palms and soles, presence of fever, and lymphadenopathy.\nNeurocysticercosis, particularly subarachnoid form, is a severe form of cysticercosis caused by the Taenia solium parasite. It primarily presents with large cysts in the subarachnoid space, leading to inflammation, hydrocephalus, and focal neurological symptoms. Key findings include calcifications on CT, complex cystic structures on MRI, and positive serum immunoblot. Differential diagnosis includes other causes of meningitis and hydrocephalus. The diagnosis is confirmed by MRI and serology, with the immunoblot being the gold standard. Treatment involves antiparasitics (albendazole and praziquantel) and corticosteroids for inflammation, with a long course of treatment and serial imaging to assess response.\nLeprosy is characterized by a pale or hypopigmented macule skin lesion often located on a distal peripheral area which may accompany neuropathic symptoms. A key feature of leprosy  includes one or more hypopigmented anaesthetic skin patches and thickened peripheral nerves. Leprosy is categorized based on the number of skin lesions, which determines the duration of treatment. Clinically, tuberculoid leprosy or borderline tuberculoid leprosy occurs with high cell-mediated immunity against M. leprae, whereas, lepromatous leprosy without an adequate cell-mediated response presents with many skin lesions. The diagnosis is largely clinical without reliable diagnostic or screening tests. Treatment of leprosy involves multidrug therapy with at least 3 drugs, often involving rifampicin, clofazimine, and dapsone, which varies in duration based on the classification, from 6 months in paucibacillary leprosy to 12 months in multibacillary leprosy. Additional investigations like skin biopsy and slit-skin smear can be performed to support the diagnosis. Leprosy awareness campaigns emphasize the importance of consulting healthcare professionals for pale patches causing reduced sensation, as leprosy is a significant public health issue in endemic countries.\nThe patient presents with skin lesions and breathlessness, which are typical for Kaposi's sarcoma (KS), particularly in a newly diagnosed HIV-infected patient. Important differential diagnoses include tuberculosis, which should be vigorously excluded due to the chronic history of cough. The diagnosis of cutaneous disease is often made by clinical appearance, though biopsy is recommended.\n"

Symptoms started 6-8 weeks after returning from a visit to northern Thailand. Laboratory findings show elevated systemic markers of inflammation. Fungal infections, such as histoplasmosis, and mycobacterial infections should be considered. Biopsies of skin, abscesses, and lymph nodes should be sent for culture and histopathological studies. PCR and serological antigen tests can help accelerate the diagnosis. The patient was given an initial diagnosis of melioidosis, but histoplasmosis was confirmed by PCR and culture of a lymph node biopsy, which also showed fungal cells of H. capsulatum. Disseminated histoplasmosis is a potentially life-threatening condition that presents with fever, malaise, anorexia, and weight loss, and requires prompt treatment with liposomal amphotericin B.\nTungiasis is a parasitic skin disease caused by the female Tunga penetrans, which burrows into the epidermis of humans causing a slowly growing nodular skin lesion, typically located in periungual regions, interdigital spaces, and soles. The disease usually presents with a pale nodule with a dark centre, later turning brown with a dark scab, and may cause local itching or pain. The diagnosis is based on the clinical presentation, and may be confirmed by microscopic examination of tissue samples in non-endemic regions. The treatment involves removing the flea with a sterile needle or curette, followed by disinfection and prevention or treatment of concomitant bacterial infections. Important differential diagnoses include other ectoparasites, bacterial infections, and complications such as gangrene, bacteraemia, or tetanus.\nMyiasis is a tropical disease caused by the larvae of flies that infest the skin of humans, typically occurring in sub-Saharan Africa and often caused by Cordylobia anthropophaga (Tumbu fly or Mango fly). The disease presents with an itchy and painful boil or lesion with no lymphadenopathy and systemic symptoms. Key signs include a whitish matter underneath the scab, a pulsating and oozing fluid appearance, and often no pustular head. The diagnosis is confirmed by the presence of a maggot, often removed after applying petroleum jelly to deprive the larvae of oxygen. Important differential diagnoses include skin and soft-tissue infections such as folliculitides, furuncles, carbuncles, or abscesses, and eschar seen in rickettsial disease or in cutaneous anthrax. Lab test or scanning is not used for the diagnosis of cutaneous myiasis, and other types of myiasis can be treated slightly differently but with a similar approach.\nScrub typhus primarily occurs in the Asia-Pacific region and is transmitted by the bite of an infected larva (chigger) of a trombiculid mite. Infected patients typically present with fever, severe headache, myalgia, regional or generalized lymphadenopathy, and a macular or maculopapular rash. CNS involvement is common, with presentations including diffuse encephalopathy, reversible sensorineural deafness, and extrapyramidal manifestations. Diagnosis is challenging and often relies on clinical evidence, with serological tests available in some settings. Standard treatment is with doxycycline 100 mg bid for 1 week, and the disease is responsive to antibiotic treatment.\nHantavirus Cardiopulmonary Syndrome (HCPS) primarily occurs in the border region between Chile and Argentina, and typically presents with non-specific prodromal symptoms followed by rapidly progressing respiratory failure and precipitous haemodynamic instability. The clinical course varies from a mild disease to its most severe form, HCPS, which is characterized by microvascular leakage and is mainly attributed to host immune response. Diagnosis is confirmed by RT-PCR from whole blood or by serology with presence of specific IgM antibodies or at least a 4-fold increase in IgG titres in paired samples. The mainstay of treatment is organ supportive therapy, and patients should be transferred to a tertiary intensive care unit immediately upon suspicion of ANDV infection. Important differential diagnoses include influenza, hantavirus infections, other respiratory viruses, pneumococcal pneumonia, rickettsial diseases, severe malaria, histoplasmosis, and cryptococcosis.\nThe patient, a 55-year-old female pig farmer, presented with fever, headache, vomiting, confusion, tachycardia, hypotension, and a non-blanching purpuric rash. The rapid progression to shock and severe neurological symptoms suggests acute bacterial meningitis. The most likely diagnosis is Streptococcus suis meningitis, confirmed by cerebrospinal fluid culture. The differential diagnoses include other forms of bacterial meningitis, melioidosis, and dengue fever. The key finding to diagnose this disease is the presence of a non-blanching purpuric rash and severe neurological symptoms in a patient with a history of contact with pigs. Lab tests, including cerebrospinal fluid culture and PCR, are crucial for confirming the diagnosis. The treatment is ceftriaxone, with adjunctive corticosteroids reducing the risk of deafness.\nA generalized, non-itchy rash is a primary symptom, which could be a manifestation of secondary syphilis.

The patient arrived at the emergency room complaining of rib pain and a one-month evolution of generalized dermatosis, whereby she was hospitalized. An important precedent was the self-medicated use of topical corticosteroids for seven weeks to treat pruritus. On physical examination, the patient had a body mass index (BMI) of 16.4 kg/m2. Furthermore, multiple fissured hyperkeratotic lesions were observed, with a psoriasiform appearance, a yellowish-brown color, and a general distribution, although they mainly affected the hands and feet. In addition, scaly lesions were observed distributed on both elbows, the anterior neck, and the posterior region of the thorax. The keratotic plaques were firm and tender on palpation and were accompanied by pruritus. Direct scraping of the injured skin on the hand was performed with a number 10 scalpel blade, then the sample was placed on a slide and a drop of mineral oil was added (Muller's test). Microscopic analysis reveals the presence of an ovoid body similar to a turtle (idiosome), endowed with four pairs of short legs, revealing infestation by Sarcoptes scabiei, which confirmed the diagnostic suspicion of CS.",

Despite initial treatment for pulmonary tuberculosis (TB), he showed no clinical improvement. The most likely diagnosis is chronic (adult) paracoccidioidomycosis, caused by the fungus Paracoccidioides brasiliensis. The disease is endemic in the moist tropical regions of Latin America and is characterized by pulmonary symptoms that slowly develop over months, typically in middle-aged men living in rural endemic areas, which are often accompanied by mucosal lesions. Differential diagnoses include multi-drug resistant TB and histoplasmosis. The diagnosis is confirmed by visualization of P. brasiliensis on wet preparation of specimen and/or isolation in fungal culture. Treatment involves azoles for mild and moderate cases, with itraconazole being the drug of choice, and amphotericin B for severe and extensive disease. Cure is determined based upon four criteria: clinical, mycological, radiological, and immunological.\nStevens–Johnson syndrome (SJS) and toxic epidermal necrolysis (TEN) is a life-threatening mucocutaneous hypersensitivity reaction caused by drugs, characterized by non-specific symptoms such as flu-like symptoms, followed by a morbiliform rash, widespread apoptosis of keratinocytes, and epithelial necrosis. Clinically, it presents with a maculopapular rash, often accompanied by conjunctivitis, swollen and hemorrhagic lips, and difficulty eating, drinking, and talking. Differential diagnoses include staphylococcal scalded skin syndrome, toxic shock syndrome, exfoliative dermatitis, autoimmune bullous diseases, and acute paraneoplastic pemphigus. The diagnosis is often made clinically, but skin biopsies may be helpful. All potentially causative drugs need to be withdrawn immediately, and treatment is supportive, with no clear benefit of disease-modifying interventions such as systemic corticosteroids or IV immunoglobulins. The case fatality rate is up to 5% in SJS and 30% in TEN, with primary causes of death being infection and multi-organ failure.\nA 46-year-old Thai woman presents with a 2-month history of recurrent and treatment-refractory cutaneous and subcutaneous abscesses, progressive lymphadenopathy, and weight loss.

Important differential diagnoses include tuberculosis, which should be vigorously excluded due to the chronic history of cough. The diagnosis of cutaneous disease is often made by clinical appearance, though biopsy is recommended.\nNeurocysticercosis, particularly subarachnoid form, is a severe form of cysticercosis caused by the Taenia solium parasite. It primarily presents with large cysts in the subarachnoid space, leading to inflammation, hydrocephalus, and focal neurological symptoms. Key findings include calcifications on CT, complex cystic structures on MRI, and positive serum immunoblot. Differential diagnosis includes other causes of meningitis and hydrocephalus. The diagnosis is confirmed by MRI and serology, with the immunoblot being the gold standard.

Clinically, it presents with a maculopapular rash, often accompanied by conjunctivitis, swollen and hemorrhagic lips, and difficulty eating, drinking, and talking. Differential diagnoses include staphylococcal scalded skin syndrome, toxic shock syndrome, exfoliative dermatitis, autoimmune bullous diseases, and acute paraneoplastic pemphigus. The diagnosis is often made clinically, but skin biopsies may be helpful. All potentially causative drugs need to be withdrawn immediately, and treatment is supportive, with no clear benefit of disease-modifying interventions such as systemic corticosteroids or IV immunoglobulins. The case fatality rate is up to 5% in SJS and 30% in TEN, with primary causes of death being infection and multi-organ failure.\nThis 20-year-old woman from the Democratic Republic of the Congo presents with acute febrile illness and disseminated uniform vesiculopustular skin rash including the palms and soles of the feet, as well as the oral mucosa. The lesions progress from macules to papules, vesicles, and pustules. The main differential diagnoses include monkeypox, smallpox, cowpox, and varicella, with important criteria to distinguish between them including distribution of skin lesions, stage of lesion development, involvement of palms and soles, presence of fever, and lymphadenopathy.\nThe patient presents with skin lesions and breathlessness, which are typical for Kaposi's sarcoma (KS), particularly in a newly diagnosed HIV-infected patient. Important differential diagnoses include tuberculosis, which should be vigorously excluded due to the chronic history of cough. The diagnosis of cutaneous disease is often made by clinical appearance, though biopsy is recommended.\nLeprosy is characterized by a pale or hypopigmented macule skin lesion often located on a distal peripheral area which may accompany neuropathic symptoms. A key feature of leprosy  includes one or more hypopigmented anaesthetic skin patches and thickened peripheral nerves. Leprosy is categorized based on the number of skin lesions, which determines the duration of treatment. Clinically, tuberculoid leprosy or borderline tuberculoid leprosy occurs with high cell-mediated immunity against M. leprae, whereas, lepromatous leprosy without an adequate cell-mediated response presents with many skin lesions. The diagnosis is largely clinical without reliable diagnostic or screening tests. Treatment of leprosy involves multidrug therapy with at least 3 drugs, often involving rifampicin, clofazimine, and dapsone, which varies in duration based on the classification, from 6 months in paucibacillary leprosy to 12 months in multibacillary leprosy. Additional investigations like skin biopsy and slit-skin smear can be performed to support the diagnosis. Leprosy awareness campaigns emphasize the importance of consulting healthcare professionals for pale patches causing reduced sensation, as leprosy is a significant public health issue in endemic countries.\nIntestinal capillariasis primarily occurs in endemic areas in East and South-east Asian countries, including The Philippines, Thailand, Laos, China, Korea, Japan, and Taiwan, with sporadic cases in other regions. The disease typically presents with chronic diarrhea, colicky abdominal pain, anorexia, vomiting, dehydration, cachexia, and pitting edema of the lower limbs. Clinical findings include malabsorption, electrolyte imbalance, and protein loss. Diagnosis is confirmed by demonstration of typical peanut-shaped eggs in stool samples, which have protruding polar plugs on both ends and measure 36 to 42 x 20 μm. Important differential diagnoses include other intestinal helminths. The diagnosis is confirmed by the detection of capillariasis eggs through stool microscopy, supported by clinical presentation, and relevant epidemiological exposure. Treatment is with mebendazole or albendazole for 20 or 10 days, respectively.\nBrucellosis is a common zoonotic bacterial infection that primarily presents as a non-focal febrile illness with symptoms such as night sweats, fatigue, lymphadenopathy, and hepatosplenomegaly. Localized infection can develop, affecting the musculoskeletal, genitourinary, central nervous, or cardiovascular system, with osteoarticular involvement being particularly common, often presenting as peripheral arthritis, sacroiliitis, or spondylitis. The diagnosis is confirmed by isolation of the causative agent, Brucella melitensis, from blood or tissue samples. The disease is treatable with a combination of antimicrobials, such as doxycycline and rifampicin, for a prolonged course of 6-12 weeks or more, depending on the organ manifestation and severity. Important differential diagnoses include spinal tuberculosis, and the disease is more common in highly endemic countries like Afghanistan.\nThe patient, a 51-year-old female traveller, presents with a generalized maculopapular rash, bilateral conjunctivitis, peripheral painful oedema (hands, elbows, knees, and feet), and generalized lymphadenopathy. This presentation is suggestive of an arboviral infection, particularly Zika virus infection. Key findings to diagnose this exact disease include: detection of viral RNA, viral antigen, or specific IgM in blood samples, and seroconversion (rise in IgG) in paired serum samples. The patient's diagnosis was confirmed by PCR and seroconversion, with a rise in anti-Zika IgM and IgG titres.\nEosinophilic meningitis, primarily occurring in South-east Asia and the Pacific basin, typically presents with headache and parasesthesia of the trunk, limbs, or face. Clinically, it is characterized by a migratory subcutaneous swelling, creeping eruption, and sharp radicular pain at onset. Important differential diagnoses include fungal meningitis with Coccidioides immitis, lymphoma, eosinophilic leukemia, sarcoid, and idiopathic hypereosinophilic syndrome. Diagnosis is confirmed by the presence of ten or more eosinophils per microliter of CSF, or eosinophilia of at least 10% of the total CSF leukocyte count, and Western blot showing specific antibodies against the 31 kD Angiostrongylus cantonensis antigen. Treatment is symptomatic and may involve corticosteroids and antiparasitic drugs.\nAfrican tick-bite fever primarily occurs in sub-Saharan Africa and typically presents with fever, myalgias, headache, and a characteristic inoculation eschar at the site of the bite with local lymphadenopathy. Clinically, it is characterized by flu-like symptoms with a characteristic eschar. Important differential diagnoses include malaria. The diagnosis is confirmed by PCR from the eschar scab or other diagnostic methods. Treatment may not be necessary in mild cases, but doxycycline 100mg bid PO for 3 to 7 days may be given and alternative options are macrolides for pregnant women and children younger than 8 years of age.\nA previously healthy 20-year-old man from southern India presents with fever and rapidly progressive quadriparesis a month after being bitten by a dog. He had received a full course of five active anti-rabies vaccinations but no anti-rabies immunoglobulin. Laboratory confirmation was secured through testing at least three saliva samples at 3- to 6-hour intervals, along with a nuchal skin biopsy for viral RNA by RT-PCR. The diagnosis is confirmed by detection of rabies virus RNA using RT-PCR from saliva or nuchal skin biopsy. Important differential diagnoses include Guillain Barré Syndrome, post-vaccination encephalomyelitis, and other conditions as listed in Table 91.1. The patient did not receive RIG, which could have possibly prevented rabies in this case.\nTuberculosis pericarditis primarily occurs in sub-Saharan Africa and typically presents with signs of cardiac decompensation, such as tachycardia, pulsus paradoxus, hypotension, impalpable apex beat, raised jugular venous pressure, and quiet heart sounds. Important differential diagnosis includes pericardial effusion due to malignancy, HIV-related Kaposi's sarcoma, or bacterial infections such as pneumonia or endocarditis. The diagnosis is confirmed by ultrasound-guided pericardial aspiration, followed by PCR from the effusion to identify Mycobacterium tuberculosis. Key to managing this condition is therapeutic pericardial aspiration to relieve the pressure on the heart, antituberculous treatment, corticosteroids, and antiretroviral therapy for HIV-positive patients.\nThe disease primarily occurs in the Amazonian rainforest and typically presents with acute febrile illness lasting 3-7 days, characterized by chills, headache, retro-orbital and epigastric pain, myalgia, arthralgia, nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, and a maculopapular rash, sometimes followed by desquamation. Haemorrhagic manifestations are rare. Prolonged polyarthralgias, which are suspected to arise from the inflammatory immune response stimulated by the prolonged virus persistence in joint tissues, can occur after the initial fever resolves. Important differential diagnoses include reactive arthritis, viral arthritis, and other alphavirus infections. The diagnosis is confirmed by detection of Mayaro virus RNA using PCR in blood or, beyond the acute phase, by serological detection of specific IgM and IgG antibodies against the Mayaro virus, using a two-step approach with highly sensitive screening assays followed by highly specific confirmatory assays.\nParagonimiasis is a sub-acute to chronic lung disease caused by infection with lung flukes of the genus Paragonimus. Paragonimus westermani is the most widely distributed species in Asia. The disease is often asymptomatic or presents with chronic cough, haemoptysis, chest pain, fever, night sweats, abnormal chest imaging, pleural effusion, and pneumothorax. Eosinophilia is a prominent feature of acute and sub-acute infection. The definitive diagnosis is made by detection of ova in sputum, BAL fluid or faeces. Immunodiagnostic screening tests such as multiple-dot ELISA can also be used. Praziquantel is the drug of choice for treatment.\nA generalized, non-itchy rash is a primary symptom, which could be a manifestation of secondary syphilis. Clinical findings include a generalized rash involving the palms of the hands, without lymphadenopathy, anemia, or jaundice. The key finding for diagnosis is positive treponemal serological test for syphilis, ideally with RPR titre of 1:8, which is a common differential diagnosis in pregnant women with a rash. The disease may cause various congenital syphilis symptoms in the baby including a generalized bullous rash, jaundice and hepatosplenomegaly. Diagnosis is confirmed by treating with intramuscular benzathine penicillin.\nSevere Fever With Thrombocytopenia Syndrome (SFTS) primarily occurs in Japan, China, and Korea, transmitted by tick bites. It typically presents with fever, nausea, diarrhea, arthralgia, myalgia, and neurological symptoms, with laboratory results showing leukopenia, thrombocytopenia, and elevated serum AST, ALT, LDH, and CK levels. Important differential diagnosis includes tick- and mite-borne infectious diseases, such as Japanese spotted fever and scrub typhus. The diagnosis is confirmed by detecting SFTS virus in blood serum by PCR, and the management involves symptomatic and supportive treatment, close monitoring of respiratory condition and blood pressure, and management of thrombocytopenia and secondary bacterial infection.\nLeprosy is characterized by a pale or hypopigmented macule skin lesion often located on a distal peripheral area which may accompany neuropathic symptoms. A key feature of leprosy  includes one or more hypopigmented anaesthetic skin patches and thickened peripheral nerves. Leprosy is categorized based on the number of skin lesions, which determines the duration of treatment. Clinically, tuberculoid leprosy or borderline tuberculoid leprosy occurs with high cell-mediated immunity against M. leprae, whereas, lepromatous leprosy without an adequate cell-mediated response presents with many skin lesions.

Leprosy awareness campaigns emphasize the importance of consulting healthcare professionals for pale patches causing reduced sensation, as leprosy is a significant public health issue in endemic countries.\nThe patient is a 40-year-old male farmer from Peru, presenting with a chronic productive cough, weight loss, and cervical lymphadenopathy. Despite initial treatment for pulmonary tuberculosis (TB), he showed no clinical improvement. The most likely diagnosis is chronic (adult) paracoccidioidomycosis, caused by the fungus Paracoccidioides brasiliensis. The disease is endemic in the moist tropical regions of Latin America and is characterized by pulmonary symptoms that slowly develop over months, typically in middle-aged men living in rural endemic areas, which are often accompanied by mucosal lesions. Differential diagnoses include multi-drug resistant TB and histoplasmosis. The diagnosis is confirmed by visualization of P. brasiliensis on wet preparation of specimen and/or isolation in fungal culture. Treatment involves azoles for mild and moderate cases, with itraconazole being the drug of choice, and amphotericin B for severe and extensive disease. Cure is determined based upon four criteria: clinical, mycological, radiological, and immunological.\nA 24-year-old woman from Uganda presents with a febrile illness, sore throat, abdominal pain, diarrhea, and bilateral conjunctivitis, with a history of her husband's recent death from a similar illness. The differential diagnoses include malaria, typhoid fever, invasive meningococcal disease, adenovirus, influenza, measles, Zika virus, and viral hemorrhagic fever (VHF), with Marburg virus disease being a key consideration given the husband's occupation in a gold mine. Testing should be done with caution, and samples should be sent to a specialized laboratory for PCR. The patient is treated with supportive care and resuscitation, and strict infection control measures should be followed.\nThe patient presents with skin lesions and breathlessness, which are typical for Kaposi's sarcoma (KS), particularly in a newly diagnosed HIV-infected patient.

         "Text": "This is a 53-year-old woman who was diagnosed with seropositive rheumatoid arthritis and treated with methotrexate in 2000. In 2013, adalimumab (one injection/15 days) plus methotrexate (10mg/week) was used due to poor progress. Since then, she has not required steroids and has remained asymptomatic with this therapeutic approach. She recently presented a mucocutaneous, erythematous and ulcerous lesion in the nasal vestibule and the upper lip that has deformed her nose (Fig. 1). For this reason, she was referred to the ENT department, where a biopsy was performed and the subsequent anatomopathological study was diagnostic of leishmaniasis, both by direct vision with the Giemsa technique and by nested polymerase chain reaction. The patient had not travelled to particularly endemic areas of this disease, nor lived with animals, nor had she any record of a bite.",

      "answer": "The final diagnosis for this 53-year-old woman is cutaneous leishmaniasis, specifically *Leishmania braziliensis*, which causes the mucocutaneous form of the disease. This diagnosis was definitively established by the histopathological findings from the nasal vestibule and upper lip biopsy, which showed characteristic *Leishmania* amastigotes and a granulomatous inflammatory infiltrate, along with positive PCR for *Leishmania* DNA. The presentation of an ulcerative lesion in an immunocompromised patient with a history of adalimumab treatment strongly points towards this diagnosis, even without a travel history to endemic areas.",
      "contexts": "A 46-year-old Thai woman presents with a 2-month history of recurrent and treatment-refractory cutaneous and subcutaneous abscesses, progressive lymphadenopathy, and weight loss. Symptoms started 6-8 weeks after returning from a visit to northern Thailand. Laboratory findings show elevated systemic markers of inflammation. Fungal infections, such as histoplasmosis, and mycobacterial infections should be considered. Biopsies of skin, abscesses, and lymph nodes should be sent for culture and histopathological studies. PCR and serological antigen tests can help accelerate the diagnosis. The patient was given an initial diagnosis of melioidosis, but histoplasmosis was confirmed by PCR and culture of a lymph node biopsy, which also showed fungal cells of H. capsulatum. Disseminated histoplasmosis is a potentially life-threatening condition that presents with fever, malaise, anorexia, and weight loss, and requires prompt treatment with liposomal amphotericin B.\nA 24-year-old woman from Uganda presents with a febrile illness, sore throat, abdominal pain, diarrhea, and bilateral conjunctivitis, with a history of her husband's recent death from a similar illness.

This presentation is suggestive of an arboviral infection, particularly Zika virus infection. Key findings to diagnose this exact disease include: detection of viral RNA, viral antigen, or specific IgM in blood samples, and seroconversion (rise in IgG) in paired serum samples. The patient's diagnosis was confirmed by PCR and seroconversion, with a rise in anti-Zika IgM and IgG titres.\nYaws is a chronic infectious disease caused by Treponema pallidum subspecies pertenue. It primarily presents with a painless, non-healing leg ulcer, which can eventually develop into a nodule that ulcerates. The ulcer is usually accompanied by arthralgias, malaise, and early osteoperiostitis. The diagnosis is based on serology using treponemal and non-treponemal tests, with RPR being a common non-treponemal test. Differential diagnoses include other skin lesions caused by bacteria such as Haemophilus ducreyi. The treatment of choice is benzathine benzylpenicillin or azithromycin. A four-fold fall in the RPR titre over 6 months is considered to indicate cure.\nThis 20-year-old woman from the Democratic Republic of the Congo presents with acute febrile illness and disseminated uniform vesiculopustular skin rash including the palms and soles of the feet, as well as the oral mucosa. The lesions progress from macules to papules, vesicles, and pustules.

Important differential diagnoses include tuberculosis, which should be vigorously excluded due to the chronic history of cough. The diagnosis of cutaneous disease is often made by clinical appearance, though biopsy is recommended.\nTungiasis is a parasitic skin disease caused by the female Tunga penetrans, which burrows into the epidermis of humans causing a slowly growing nodular skin lesion, typically located in periungual regions, interdigital spaces, and soles. The disease usually presents with a pale nodule with a dark centre, later turning brown with a dark scab, and may cause local itching or pain. The diagnosis is based on the clinical presentation, and may be confirmed by microscopic examination of tissue samples in non-endemic regions. The treatment involves removing the flea with a sterile needle or curette, followed by disinfection and prevention or treatment of concomitant bacterial infections. Important differential diagnoses include other ectoparasites, bacterial infections, and complications such as gangrene, bacteraemia, or tetanus.\nLassa fever primarily occurs in sub-Saharan West Africa, including Liberia, Sierra Leone, Ghana, and Nigeria, and possibly other areas of sub-Saharan West Africa. The disease starts insidiously with fever, body aches, and weakness, often accompanied by sore throat, retrosternal chest pain, abdominal symptoms such as pain, diarrhea, and vomiting, cough, and breathlessness. Conjunctivitis is common, especially late in the disease. Raised liver transaminases are markers of severity and are associated with a higher case fatality rate. Important differential diagnoses include adenovirus infections, measles, Mycoplasma pneumoniae, leptospirosis, and typhoid fever. The diagnosis is confirmed with antigen testing or PCR tests. The treatment is with IV ribavirin, which should be given early in the disease and can be beneficial, but the quality of studies on this are poor.\nAfrican tick-bite fever primarily occurs in sub-Saharan Africa and typically presents with fever, myalgias, headache, and a characteristic inoculation eschar at the site of the bite with local lymphadenopathy. Clinically, it is characterized by flu-like symptoms with a characteristic eschar. Important differential diagnoses include malaria. The diagnosis is confirmed by PCR from the eschar scab or other diagnostic methods. Treatment may not be necessary in mild cases, but doxycycline 100mg bid PO for 3 to 7 days may be given and alternative options are macrolides for pregnant women and children younger than 8 years of age.\nIntestinal capillariasis primarily occurs in endemic areas in East and South-east Asian countries, including The Philippines, Thailand, Laos, China, Korea, Japan, and Taiwan, with sporadic cases in other regions.

A four-fold fall in the RPR titre over 6 months is considered to indicate cure.\nSickle cell disease typically presents with chronic, painful leg ulcers, often on the ankles, with surrounding skin hyperpigmentation. It is characterized by episodes of acute illness against a background of progressive organ damage due to the tendency of abnormal hemoglobin S to polymerize in hypoxic conditions, leading to reduced erythrocyte flexibility and vaso-occlusion. The disease manifests in adulthood with slow-healing ulcers, common colonization with pathogenic bacteria, and periosteal reaction. Differential diagnoses include tropical ulcer, diabetic ulcer, and chronic osteomyelitis with discharging sinus. Diagnosis is confirmed by haemoglobin electrophoresis showing a homozygous HbSS-type. Key findings to diagnose sickle cell disease include the presence of irreversibly sickled cells on a blood film, high white cell counts, and a positive sickling test.\nBrucellosis is a common zoonotic bacterial infection that primarily presents as a non-focal febrile illness with symptoms such as night sweats, fatigue, lymphadenopathy, and hepatosplenomegaly. Localized infection can develop, affecting the musculoskeletal, genitourinary, central nervous, or cardiovascular system, with osteoarticular involvement being particularly common, often presenting as peripheral arthritis, sacroiliitis, or spondylitis.

         "Text": "A 29-year-old presented to the emergency department (ED) of hospital A with a 4-week history of headache and fevers, followed by an acute deterioration in consciousness. He had no known medical comorbidities or allergies. He was originally from Bolivia but had lived in Europe for the last 15 years (Ireland for the past year). The patient worked as a mechanic, had no pets, no recent travel history and no unusual contacts or hobbies. In the preceding 4 weeks and prior to his deterioration, he had presented on two separate occasions to a hospital emergency department – once to hospital A and once to hospital B, a different hospital in the city. At the first visit, which was to hospital A, the patient reported a mild headache, which responded to analgesia with no red flag symptoms. Blood tests were taken, including a routine opt-out bloodborne viral (BBV) screen. The patient was discharged from the ED. The BBV screen was subsequently reported as reactive for HIV antigen and antibody. Multiple unsuccessful attempts were made by staff to contact the patient by telephone and post. Two weeks later, the patient was brought back to the emergency department of hospital A. He presented with reduced consciousness. The patient’s housemates, who accompanied him to the hospital, reported worsening drowsiness over the preceding days. On initial examination, Glasgow Coma Scale (GCS) was 12/15, with unequal pupils. His temperature was 40.0°C and his heart rate was 120 beats per minute. Initial oxygen saturation was 99% in room air. One hour after presentation, GCS deteriorated from 12 to 6. Due to worsening level of consciousness and onset of respiratory failure, he was intubated and transferred to the intensive care unit (ICU). Initial blood tests showed lymphopaenia of 0.6 x 109/L (1.5-3.5 109/L), Hb 10.5g/dL (13.5 – 18g/dL), and CRP 59 mg/L (0.00 – 5.00mg/L). A chest radiograph showed diffuse, patchy opacification bilaterally. A brain CT showed multiple supratentorial ring-enhancing lesions bilaterally, with significant associated cerebral oedema and rightward midline shift. The patient was commenced on empiric therapy for meningitis (ceftriaxone, amoxicillin, and vancomycin) and cerebral toxoplasmosis (sulfadiazine and pyrimethamine, with folinic acid). Thoracic CT was also performed, which showed findings suggestive of Pneumocystis jirovecii pneumonia (PJP); cotrimoxazole was commenced.",

      "ground_truth": "The patient’s inpatient care was coordinated by the intensive care and infectious diseases teams, with ongoing discussions with neurosurgical colleagues. CD4 count was 6 cells/mm3, (5%) (502–1,749 cells/mm3, 35%–60%). Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) of the brain on day 1 showed multiple ring-enhancing supratentorial and infratentorial. The differential diagnosis included neuro-toxoplasmosis and other infectious and non-infectious causes of multiple brain lesions in an immunosuppressed host with the potential chance of Chagas disease",
      "answer": "The final diagnosis for this patient is HIV-associated Pneumocystis jirovecii pneumonia (PJP), complicated by severe cerebral toxoplasmosis and disseminated intravascular coagulation (DIC). The patient's presentation with acute onset of fever, confusion, and worsening neurological impairment, along with the characteristic brain lesions on imaging and the rapid deterioration, strongly points towards opportunistic infections in an immunocompromised host. The positive HIV antigen and antibody tests, coupled with the severe immunosuppression indicated by the CD4 count of 6 cells/μL, confirmed the underlying immunodeficiency. The presence of diffuse pulmonary infiltrates, lymphopaenia, and elevated CRP further supports the diagnosis of PJP, while the cerebral lesions and oedema are classic signs of toxoplasmosis.",
      "contexts": "This 52-year-old man from Vietnam presented with evolving shock, symptoms include abdominal pain, vomiting, retro-orbital headache, lethargy, myalgia, and fevers. Clinically, it is characterized by low Glasgow Coma Score, tachycardia, narrow pulse pressure, respiratory distress, and mild abdominal distension. Important differential diagnoses include dengue infection, scrub typhus, leptospirosis, and malaria. The diagnosis of dengue infection is confirmed by detection of NS1 antigen by RDTs or ELISA or detection of viral RNA using RT-PCR. Key findings that suggest severe dengue include abdominal pain or tenderness, persistent vomiting, fluid accumulation, mucosal bleeding, and increasing haematocrit with concurrent worsening of thrombocytopenia.\nA 23-year-old HIV-positive Zambian woman presented with a new-onset seizure. The clinical presentation included a single convulsive seizure lasting 5-10 minutes, without any focal neurological deficits. CSF examination was normal apart from a slightly raised protein level. Neuroimaging revealed hypodense lesions without contrast enhancement restricted to the subcortical white matter. EEG demonstrated focal slowing in the right hemisphere. The patient is at high risk of opportunistic CNS infections, including PML, which is the most likely underlying diagnosis. Important differential diagnoses include tuberculoma, cerebral toxoplasmosis, cryptococcoma, brain abscess and primary CNS lymphoma. The correct diagnosis is confirmed by detecting JC-virus DNA in the CSF, with a key laboratory finding of JC-virus DNA positivity. The management involves antiepileptic treatment with carbamazepine and ART, with supportive care to manage potential complications.\nThe patient, a 55-year-old female pig farmer, presented with fever, headache, vomiting, confusion, tachycardia, hypotension, and a non-blanching purpuric rash. The rapid progression to shock and severe neurological symptoms suggests acute bacterial meningitis. The most likely diagnosis is Streptococcus suis meningitis, confirmed by cerebrospinal fluid culture. The differential diagnoses include other forms of bacterial meningitis, melioidosis, and dengue fever. The key finding to diagnose this disease is the presence of a non-blanching purpuric rash and severe neurological symptoms in a patient with a history of contact with pigs. Lab tests, including cerebrospinal fluid culture and PCR, are crucial for confirming the diagnosis. The treatment is ceftriaxone, with adjunctive corticosteroids reducing the risk of deafness.\nThis patient, a 35-year-old Peruvian logger, presents with acute febrile illness that produces liver failure, jaundice, bleeding, encephalopathy, and seizures. The diagnosis is confirmed by IgM capture ELISA positivity for yellow fever virus, which is a flavivirus transmitted by Aedes and Haemagogus mosquitoes. The symptoms presented include fever, jaundice, coffee-ground vomiting, gross hematuria, and mental obtundation. Clinically, it is characterized by rapid progression to gastrointestinal illness, dehydration, and multiorgan dysfunction. Important differential diagnoses include severe malaria, viral hepatitis, toxin-mediated hepatitis, leptospirosis, and dengue hemorrhagic fever. The diagnosis is confirmed by detection of yellow fever virus through IgM capture ELISA, supported by relevant epidemiological exposure to the virus.\nAfrican tick-bite fever primarily occurs in sub-Saharan Africa and typically presents with fever, myalgias, headache, and a characteristic inoculation eschar at the site of the bite with local lymphadenopathy. Clinically, it is characterized by flu-like symptoms with a characteristic eschar. Important differential diagnoses include malaria. The diagnosis is confirmed by PCR from the eschar scab or other diagnostic methods. Treatment may not be necessary in mild cases, but doxycycline 100mg bid PO for 3 to 7 days may be given and alternative options are macrolides for pregnant women and children younger than 8 years of age.\nLassa fever primarily occurs in sub-Saharan West Africa, including Liberia, Sierra Leone, Ghana, and Nigeria, and possibly other areas of sub-Saharan West Africa. The disease starts insidiously with fever, body aches, and weakness, often accompanied by sore throat, retrosternal chest pain, abdominal symptoms such as pain, diarrhea, and vomiting, cough, and breathlessness. Conjunctivitis is common, especially late in the disease. Raised liver transaminases are markers of severity and are associated with a higher case fatality rate. Important differential diagnoses include adenovirus infections, measles, Mycoplasma pneumoniae, leptospirosis, and typhoid fever. The diagnosis is confirmed with antigen testing or PCR tests. The treatment is with IV ribavirin, which should be given early in the disease and can be beneficial, but the quality of studies on this are poor.\nThe patient, a 51-year-old female traveller, presents with a generalized maculopapular rash, bilateral conjunctivitis, peripheral painful oedema (hands, elbows, knees, and feet), and generalized lymphadenopathy. This presentation is suggestive of an arboviral infection, particularly Zika virus infection. Key findings to diagnose this exact disease include: detection of viral RNA, viral antigen, or specific IgM in blood samples, and seroconversion (rise in IgG) in paired serum samples. The patient's diagnosis was confirmed by PCR and seroconversion, with a rise in anti-Zika IgM and IgG titres.\nA 23-year-old HIV-positive Zambian woman presented with a new-onset seizure. The clinical presentation included a single convulsive seizure lasting 5-10 minutes, without any focal neurological deficits. CSF examination was normal apart from a slightly raised protein level.

The correct diagnosis is confirmed by detecting JC-virus DNA in the CSF, with a key laboratory finding of JC-virus DNA positivity. The management involves antiepileptic treatment with carbamazepine and ART, with supportive care to manage potential complications.\nThe patient presents with skin lesions and breathlessness, which are typical for Kaposi's sarcoma (KS), particularly in a newly diagnosed HIV-infected patient. Important differential diagnoses include tuberculosis, which should be vigorously excluded due to the chronic history of cough. The diagnosis of cutaneous disease is often made by clinical appearance, though biopsy is recommended.\nStevens–Johnson syndrome (SJS) and toxic epidermal necrolysis (TEN) is a life-threatening mucocutaneous hypersensitivity reaction caused by drugs, characterized by non-specific symptoms such as flu-like symptoms, followed by a morbiliform rash, widespread apoptosis of keratinocytes, and epithelial necrosis. Clinically, it presents with a maculopapular rash, often accompanied by conjunctivitis, swollen and hemorrhagic lips, and difficulty eating, drinking, and talking. Differential diagnoses include staphylococcal scalded skin syndrome, toxic shock syndrome, exfoliative dermatitis, autoimmune bullous diseases, and acute paraneoplastic pemphigus. The diagnosis is often made clinically, but skin biopsies may be helpful. All potentially causative drugs need to be withdrawn immediately, and treatment is supportive, with no clear benefit of disease-modifying interventions such as systemic corticosteroids or IV immunoglobulins. The case fatality rate is up to 5% in SJS and 30% in TEN, with primary causes of death being infection and multi-organ failure.\nGnathostomiasis is a zoonotic nematode infection caused by Gnathostoma spinigerum, primarily acquired by eating raw or undercooked freshwater fish and crustaceans. It typically presents with a mobile itchy mass, intermittent creeping eruptions, and eosinophilia. Cutaneous disease develops within a month, manifesting as non-pitting oedematous migratory swellings, mainly affecting the trunk and proximal limbs. Visceral disease occurs when the larvae migrate through internal organs, potentially leading to CNS invasion, characterized by eosinophilic meningoencephalitis, subarachnoid hemorrhages, cranial neuritis, or painful radiculomyelitis. Diagnosis is suggested by eosinophilia, migratory swellings, and a history of geographical and food exposure, and confirmed by microscopy, radiology, or positive serological examination. Treatment consists of albendazole 400mg bid for 21 days and/or ivermectin 200 μg/kg on two consecutive days, with adjunctive corticosteroids in CNS infection. Key differentials include Loa loa infection and sparganosis, which typically present with fine, serpiginous tracks and not large mobile masses.\nCholangiocarcinoma primarily occurs in regions with high prevalence of liver fluke infection. The patient is asymptomatic but with a history of eating raw or undercooked freshwater fish containing metacercariae of the liver fluke, Opisthorchis viverrini. Elevated CA19-9 level is a suggestive diagnostic clue. Importantly, the key differential diagnoses include hepatocellular carcinoma, metastatic tumour, and infections such as tuberculosis. Confirmation of the diagnosis is made by histology and detection of the liver fluke in the bile duct. Important key findings to diagnose this exact disease include a high serum CA19-9 level, a history of liver fluke infection, and the presence of the parasite in the bile duct. Early detection is crucial and screening is necessary for the control of the disease.\nA 23-year-old HIV-positive Zambian woman presented with a new-onset seizure. The clinical presentation included a single convulsive seizure lasting 5-10 minutes, without any focal neurological deficits. CSF examination was normal apart from a slightly raised protein level.

         "Text": "A 56-year-old otherwise healthy Guatemalan male landscaper presented to the emergency room with complaints of worsening swelling and pain in his right lower extremity over the past two months, accompanied by multiple raised and indurated lesions at various stages of healing along the right posteriomedial calf. In 2018, the patient experienced a similar episode involving the right lower extremity, during which surgical debridement and primary closure by podiatry were performed. This was followed by a two-week course of trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole (TMP-SMX) and cefazolin, resulting in complete resolution of symptoms related to coexisting Nocardia spp., methicillin-susceptible Staphylococcus aureus (MSSA), and Streptococcus agalactiae group B infections as confirmed by blood and tissue cultures at that time. The physical exam during his current presentation revealed marked edema of the distal right lower extremity, multiple granulomatous foci, and two well-healed scars along the medial and lateral aspects of the calf, attributable to his previous surgical debridement from 2018 (Figure 1). He had full strength and sensation in the affected extremity without any discernible deficits. There were no signs indicative of a systemic infection, and the patient’s vital signs remained stable. A computed tomography (CT) scan was completed, showing superficial compartment edema of the posterior distal lower extremity, along with an irregular heterogenous collection in the posteriomedial calf (Figure 2). Given the uncertainty regarding deep compartment involvement and the high suspicion of a developing abscess due to a recurrent Nocardia spp. infection, the patient was subsequently taken to the operating room. The final surgical pathology from the biopsied lesions and muscle indicated small clusters of thin filiform bacteria, which stained positively for Gram and Ziehl-Neelsen, most consistent with an actinomycetoma.",

Symptoms started 6-8 weeks after returning from a visit to northern Thailand. Laboratory findings show elevated systemic markers of inflammation. Fungal infections, such as histoplasmosis, and mycobacterial infections should be considered. Biopsies of skin, abscesses, and lymph nodes should be sent for culture and histopathological studies. PCR and serological antigen tests can help accelerate the diagnosis. The patient was given an initial diagnosis of melioidosis, but histoplasmosis was confirmed by PCR and culture of a lymph node biopsy, which also showed fungal cells of H. capsulatum. Disseminated histoplasmosis is a potentially life-threatening condition that presents with fever, malaise, anorexia, and weight loss, and requires prompt treatment with liposomal amphotericin B.\nGnathostomiasis is a zoonotic nematode infection caused by Gnathostoma spinigerum, primarily acquired by eating raw or undercooked freshwater fish and crustaceans.

The chronic phase is usually asymptomatic but can progress to organ involvement, predominantly affecting the heart, with manifestations including bradycardia, ventricular arrhythmias, and dilated cardiomyopathy, and the gastrointestinal tract, with megaoesophagus and megacolon. Diagnosis is by direct visualization of trypomastigotes in the acute phase or serological testing in the chronic phase. Treatment is with trypanocidal drugs, benznidazole or nifurtimox, but is often associated with adverse events. Important differential diagnoses include vector-borne diseases such as malaria and dengue fever. The diagnosis is confirmed by Trypanosoma cruzi serology using two different testing methods along with the patient's history and exposure to triatomine bugs. \nHantavirus Cardiopulmonary Syndrome (HCPS) primarily occurs in the border region between Chile and Argentina, and typically presents with non-specific prodromal symptoms followed by rapidly progressing respiratory failure and precipitous haemodynamic instability. The clinical course varies from a mild disease to its most severe form, HCPS, which is characterized by microvascular leakage and is mainly attributed to host immune response. Diagnosis is confirmed by RT-PCR from whole blood or by serology with presence of specific IgM antibodies or at least a 4-fold increase in IgG titres in paired samples. The mainstay of treatment is organ supportive therapy, and patients should be transferred to a tertiary intensive care unit immediately upon suspicion of ANDV infection. Important differential diagnoses include influenza, hantavirus infections, other respiratory viruses, pneumococcal pneumonia, rickettsial diseases, severe malaria, histoplasmosis, and cryptococcosis.\nA 24-year-old woman from Uganda presents with a febrile illness, sore throat, abdominal pain, diarrhea, and bilateral conjunctivitis, with a history of her husband's recent death from a similar illness. The differential diagnoses include malaria, typhoid fever, invasive meningococcal disease, adenovirus, influenza, measles, Zika virus, and viral hemorrhagic fever (VHF), with Marburg virus disease being a key consideration given the husband's occupation in a gold mine. Testing should be done with caution, and samples should be sent to a specialized laboratory for PCR. The patient is treated with supportive care and resuscitation, and strict infection control measures should be followed.\nThe patient, a 51-year-old female traveller, presents with a generalized maculopapular rash, bilateral conjunctivitis, peripheral painful oedema (hands, elbows, knees, and feet), and generalized lymphadenopathy.

It is characterized by episodes of acute illness against a background of progressive organ damage due to the tendency of abnormal hemoglobin S to polymerize in hypoxic conditions, leading to reduced erythrocyte flexibility and vaso-occlusion. The disease manifests in adulthood with slow-healing ulcers, common colonization with pathogenic bacteria, and periosteal reaction. Differential diagnoses include tropical ulcer, diabetic ulcer, and chronic osteomyelitis with discharging sinus. Diagnosis is confirmed by haemoglobin electrophoresis showing a homozygous HbSS-type. Key findings to diagnose sickle cell disease include the presence of irreversibly sickled cells on a blood film, high white cell counts, and a positive sickling test.\nMyiasis is a tropical disease caused by the larvae of flies that infest the skin of humans, typically occurring in sub-Saharan Africa and often caused by Cordylobia anthropophaga (Tumbu fly or Mango fly). The disease presents with an itchy and painful boil or lesion with no lymphadenopathy and systemic symptoms. Key signs include a whitish matter underneath the scab, a pulsating and oozing fluid appearance, and often no pustular head. The diagnosis is confirmed by the presence of a maggot, often removed after applying petroleum jelly to deprive the larvae of oxygen. Important differential diagnoses include skin and soft-tissue infections such as folliculitides, furuncles, carbuncles, or abscesses, and eschar seen in rickettsial disease or in cutaneous anthrax. Lab test or scanning is not used for the diagnosis of cutaneous myiasis, and other types of myiasis can be treated slightly differently but with a similar approach.\nA previously healthy 20-year-old man from southern India presents with fever and rapidly progressive quadriparesis a month after being bitten by a dog. He had received a full course of five active anti-rabies vaccinations but no anti-rabies immunoglobulin. Laboratory confirmation was secured through testing at least three saliva samples at 3- to 6-hour intervals, along with a nuchal skin biopsy for viral RNA by RT-PCR. The diagnosis is confirmed by detection of rabies virus RNA using RT-PCR from saliva or nuchal skin biopsy. Important differential diagnoses include Guillain Barré Syndrome, post-vaccination encephalomyelitis, and other conditions as listed in Table 91.1. The patient did not receive RIG, which could have possibly prevented rabies in this case.\nThis patient, a 35-year-old Peruvian logger, presents with acute febrile illness that produces liver failure, jaundice, bleeding, encephalopathy, and seizures. The diagnosis is confirmed by IgM capture ELISA positivity for yellow fever virus, which is a flavivirus transmitted by Aedes and Haemagogus mosquitoes. The symptoms presented include fever, jaundice, coffee-ground vomiting, gross hematuria, and mental obtundation. Clinically, it is characterized by rapid progression to gastrointestinal illness, dehydration, and multiorgan dysfunction. Important differential diagnoses include severe malaria, viral hepatitis, toxin-mediated hepatitis, leptospirosis, and dengue hemorrhagic fever. The diagnosis is confirmed by detection of yellow fever virus through IgM capture ELISA, supported by relevant epidemiological exposure to the virus.\nThis 20-year-old woman from the Democratic Republic of the Congo presents with acute febrile illness and disseminated uniform vesiculopustular skin rash including the palms and soles of the feet, as well as the oral mucosa. The lesions progress from macules to papules, vesicles, and pustules. The main differential diagnoses include monkeypox, smallpox, cowpox, and varicella, with important criteria to distinguish between them including distribution of skin lesions, stage of lesion development, involvement of palms and soles, presence of fever, and lymphadenopathy.\nThe patient presents with skin lesions and breathlessness, which are typical for Kaposi's sarcoma (KS), particularly in a newly diagnosed HIV-infected patient. Important differential diagnoses include tuberculosis, which should be vigorously excluded due to the chronic history of cough. The diagnosis of cutaneous disease is often made by clinical appearance, though biopsy is recommended.\nLeprosy is characterized by a pale or hypopigmented macule skin lesion often located on a distal peripheral area which may accompany neuropathic symptoms. A key feature of leprosy  includes one or more hypopigmented anaesthetic skin patches and thickened peripheral nerves. Leprosy is categorized based on the number of skin lesions, which determines the duration of treatment. Clinically, tuberculoid leprosy or borderline tuberculoid leprosy occurs with high cell-mediated immunity against M. leprae, whereas, lepromatous leprosy without an adequate cell-mediated response presents with many skin lesions. The diagnosis is largely clinical without reliable diagnostic or screening tests. Treatment of leprosy involves multidrug therapy with at least 3 drugs, often involving rifampicin, clofazimine, and dapsone, which varies in duration based on the classification, from 6 months in paucibacillary leprosy to 12 months in multibacillary leprosy. Additional investigations like skin biopsy and slit-skin smear can be performed to support the diagnosis. Leprosy awareness campaigns emphasize the importance of consulting healthcare professionals for pale patches causing reduced sensation, as leprosy is a significant public health issue in endemic countries.\nLeprosy is characterized by a pale or hypopigmented macule skin lesion often located on a distal peripheral area which may accompany neuropathic symptoms.

Symptoms started 6-8 weeks after returning from a visit to northern Thailand. Laboratory findings show elevated systemic markers of inflammation. Fungal infections, such as histoplasmosis, and mycobacterial infections should be considered. Biopsies of skin, abscesses, and lymph nodes should be sent for culture and histopathological studies. PCR and serological antigen tests can help accelerate the diagnosis. The patient was given an initial diagnosis of melioidosis, but histoplasmosis was confirmed by PCR and culture of a lymph node biopsy, which also showed fungal cells of H. capsulatum. Disseminated histoplasmosis is a potentially life-threatening condition that presents with fever, malaise, anorexia, and weight loss, and requires prompt treatment with liposomal amphotericin B.\nScrub typhus primarily occurs in the Asia-Pacific region and is transmitted by the bite of an infected larva (chigger) of a trombiculid mite. Infected patients typically present with fever, severe headache, myalgia, regional or generalized lymphadenopathy, and a macular or maculopapular rash. CNS involvement is common, with presentations including diffuse encephalopathy, reversible sensorineural deafness, and extrapyramidal manifestations. Diagnosis is challenging and often relies on clinical evidence, with serological tests available in some settings. Standard treatment is with doxycycline 100 mg bid for 1 week, and the disease is responsive to antibiotic treatment.\nA 46-year-old Thai woman presents with a 2-month history of recurrent and treatment-refractory cutaneous and subcutaneous abscesses, progressive lymphadenopathy, and weight loss.

Despite initial treatment for pulmonary tuberculosis (TB), he showed no clinical improvement. The most likely diagnosis is chronic (adult) paracoccidioidomycosis, caused by the fungus Paracoccidioides brasiliensis. The disease is endemic in the moist tropical regions of Latin America and is characterized by pulmonary symptoms that slowly develop over months, typically in middle-aged men living in rural endemic areas, which are often accompanied by mucosal lesions. Differential diagnoses include multi-drug resistant TB and histoplasmosis. The diagnosis is confirmed by visualization of P. brasiliensis on wet preparation of specimen and/or isolation in fungal culture. Treatment involves azoles for mild and moderate cases, with itraconazole being the drug of choice, and amphotericin B for severe and extensive disease. Cure is determined based upon four criteria: clinical, mycological, radiological, and immunological.\nThis 20-year-old woman from the Democratic Republic of the Congo presents with acute febrile illness and disseminated uniform vesiculopustular skin rash including the palms and soles of the feet, as well as the oral mucosa. The lesions progress from macules to papules, vesicles, and pustules.

         "Text": "A 50 years old Aryan female from Lalitpur district, Nepal, presented to Patan Hospital Emergency Department in December 2018 with complaints of abdominal pain that had persisted for two days. She had multiple episodes of vomiting. In terms of the patient’s history, she had been treated with amlodipine and atenolol for hypertension and undergone a total abdominal hysterectomy 5 years prior for fibroids. She was a farmer living in suburban area of Lalitpur and involved in growing of vegetables and rearing of cows and poultry. On assessment, her blood pressure was 170/100 mmHg and her pulse rate was 88 beats per minute. Temperature was 98 degree Fahrenheit. Abdominal examination showed tenderness in the right upper quadrant. Plain computed tomography (CT) of the head was normal. Cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) analysis revealed the following (with normal range in parentheses): Red blood cells= 6 (0–10)/mm^3; white blood cells = absent (0–5/mm^3); protein= 45 (20–45) mg/dL; sugar= 71 (45–80) mg/dL; lactate= 2 (1.1–2.8) mmol/L; adenosine deaminase (ADA) = 6.2 U/L; GeneXpert was negative for Mycobacterium Tuberculosis; CSF India ink staining was negative; Bacterial culture showed no growth over 48 hours.

      "ground_truth": "Despite an initially nonspecific presentation and largely unremarkable CSF parameters, the detection of cryptococcal antigen in cerebrospinal fluid by latex agglutination is highly sensitive and specific for Cryptococcus infection. Negative bacterial cultures, GeneXpert testing, and India ink staining do not exclude cryptococcal meningitis, particularly in early or low-burden disease. The positive CSF cryptococcal antigen result establishes the diagnosis, even in an HIV-negative patient.",
      "answer": "The final diagnosis for this 50-year-old woman from Nepal is cryptococcal meningitis. This was confirmed by the positive CSF Cryptococcal antigen test, along with the presence of elevated CSF protein (45 mg/dL), low CSF glucose (71 mg/dL), and elevated CSF lactate (2.8 mmol/L), despite the absence of significant CSF pleocytosis (white blood cells absent, red blood cells 6/mm^3). The negative CSF India ink staining and GeneXpert for M. Tuberculosis, coupled with the negative HIV serology, strongly support this diagnosis.",
      "contexts": "A 23-year-old HIV-positive Zambian woman presented with a new-onset seizure. The clinical presentation included a single convulsive seizure lasting 5-10 minutes, without any focal neurological deficits. CSF examination was normal apart from a slightly raised protein level. Neuroimaging revealed hypodense lesions without contrast enhancement restricted to the subcortical white matter. EEG demonstrated focal slowing in the right hemisphere. The patient is at high risk of opportunistic CNS infections, including PML, which is the most likely underlying diagnosis. Important differential diagnoses include tuberculoma, cerebral toxoplasmosis, cryptococcoma, brain abscess and primary CNS lymphoma. The correct diagnosis is confirmed by detecting JC-virus DNA in the CSF, with a key laboratory finding of JC-virus DNA positivity. The management involves antiepileptic treatment with carbamazepine and ART, with supportive care to manage potential complications.\nA 24-year-old woman from Uganda presents with a febrile illness, sore throat, abdominal pain, diarrhea, and bilateral conjunctivitis, with a history of her husband's recent death from a similar illness. The differential diagnoses include malaria, typhoid fever, invasive meningococcal disease, adenovirus, influenza, measles, Zika virus, and viral hemorrhagic fever (VHF), with Marburg virus disease being a key consideration given the husband's occupation in a gold mine. Testing should be done with caution, and samples should be sent to a specialized laboratory for PCR. The patient is treated with supportive care and resuscitation, and strict infection control measures should be followed.\nA 24-year-old woman from the Peruvian Andes presents with a history of fever, weight loss, and abdominal pain. The clinical features include pale mucous membranes, right upper quadrant tenderness, and a liver span of 15 cm. The patient has pronounced eosinophilia and multiple hypodense non-enhancing hepatic lesions on CT scan. Clinically, the patient is diagnosed with fascioliasis, an infection caused by the liver flukes Fasciola hepatica. The differential diagnoses include pyogenic liver abscess, amoebic liver abscess, brucellosis, visceral toxocariasis, and secondary infections. The most useful investigation to establish the diagnosis is serology, specifically the Fas2 ELISA, which detects antibodies to Fasciola hepatica. The definitive diagnosis is based on the microscopic detection of eggs in stool. Treatments with a single dose of 10mg/kg Triclabendazole are usually effective\nEosinophilic meningitis, primarily occurring in South-east Asia and the Pacific basin, typically presents with headache and parasesthesia of the trunk, limbs, or face. Clinically, it is characterized by a migratory subcutaneous swelling, creeping eruption, and sharp radicular pain at onset. Important differential diagnoses include fungal meningitis with Coccidioides immitis, lymphoma, eosinophilic leukemia, sarcoid, and idiopathic hypereosinophilic syndrome. Diagnosis is confirmed by the presence of ten or more eosinophils per microliter of CSF, or eosinophilia of at least 10% of the total CSF leukocyte count, and Western blot showing specific antibodies against the 31 kD Angiostrongylus cantonensis antigen. Treatment is symptomatic and may involve corticosteroids and antiparasitic drugs.\nThe patient, a 55-year-old female pig farmer, presented with fever, headache, vomiting, confusion, tachycardia, hypotension, and a non-blanching purpuric rash. The rapid progression to shock and severe neurological symptoms suggests acute bacterial meningitis. The most likely diagnosis is Streptococcus suis meningitis, confirmed by cerebrospinal fluid culture. The differential diagnoses include other forms of bacterial meningitis, melioidosis, and dengue fever. The key finding to diagnose this disease is the presence of a non-blanching purpuric rash and severe neurological symptoms in a patient with a history of contact with pigs. Lab tests, including cerebrospinal fluid culture and PCR, are crucial for confirming the diagnosis. The treatment is ceftriaxone, with adjunctive corticosteroids reducing the risk of deafness.\nAfrican tick-bite fever primarily occurs in sub-Saharan Africa and typically presents with fever, myalgias, headache, and a characteristic inoculation eschar at the site of the bite with local lymphadenopathy. Clinically, it is characterized by flu-like symptoms with a characteristic eschar. Important differential diagnoses include malaria. The diagnosis is confirmed by PCR from the eschar scab or other diagnostic methods. Treatment may not be necessary in mild cases, but doxycycline 100mg bid PO for 3 to 7 days may be given and alternative options are macrolides for pregnant women and children younger than 8 years of age.\nThe patient, a 51-year-old female traveller, presents with a generalized maculopapular rash, bilateral conjunctivitis, peripheral painful oedema (hands, elbows, knees, and feet), and generalized lymphadenopathy. This presentation is suggestive of an arboviral infection, particularly Zika virus infection. Key findings to diagnose this exact disease include: detection of viral RNA, viral antigen, or specific IgM in blood samples, and seroconversion (rise in IgG) in paired serum samples. The patient's diagnosis was confirmed by PCR and seroconversion, with a rise in anti-Zika IgM and IgG titres.\nA 23-year-old HIV-positive Zambian woman presented with a new-onset seizure.

The treatment is ceftriaxone, with adjunctive corticosteroids reducing the risk of deafness.\nSparganosis is a rare, parasitic infection in humans caused by the larval stage of a zoonotic tapeworm of the genus Spirometra. The most common manifestation of cerebral sparganosis is epileptic seizures, especially in patients from endemic areas such as Japan, China, South Korea, and Thailand. The infection is usually diagnosed based on a combination of clinical history, laboratory tests (eosinophilia, positive serology), CT and MRI findings, and histopathology. The characteristic 'tunnel sign' in post-contrast MRI is a key diagnostic feature. The disease's differential diagnosis includes brain tumors or metastases, neurocysticercosis, cerebral schistosomiasis, and paragonimiasis. Treatment primarily involves the removal of the sparganum from the brain via surgery, although high-dose praziquantel has shown similar efficacy in some cases. The sparganum usually migrates to the brain through the consumption of raw, infected meat or contaminated water, indicating the presence of the parasite cycle in the food chain.\nNeurocysticercosis, particularly subarachnoid form, is a severe form of cysticercosis caused by the Taenia solium parasite. It primarily presents with large cysts in the subarachnoid space, leading to inflammation, hydrocephalus, and focal neurological symptoms. Key findings include calcifications on CT, complex cystic structures on MRI, and positive serum immunoblot. Differential diagnosis includes other causes of meningitis and hydrocephalus. The diagnosis is confirmed by MRI and serology, with the immunoblot being the gold standard. Treatment involves antiparasitics (albendazole and praziquantel) and corticosteroids for inflammation, with a long course of treatment and serial imaging to assess response.\nA 23-year-old HIV-positive Zambian woman presented with a new-onset seizure. The clinical presentation included a single convulsive seizure lasting 5-10 minutes, without any focal neurological deficits. CSF examination was normal apart from a slightly raised protein level.

Treatment is symptomatic and may involve corticosteroids and antiparasitic drugs.\nThe patient is a 37-year-old woman from Malawi with haematemesis, presenting with splenomegaly, pancytopenia, and normocytic anemia. The most likely cause of her haematemesis is upper gastrointestinal bleeding due to gastro-oesophageal varices secondary to portal hypertension. Important differential diagnoses include peptic ulcer disease, erosive gastritis, bleeding tumours, oesophageal cancer, and visceral leishmaniasis. The diagnosis is confirmed by gastroduodenoscopy showing oesophageal varices. Laboratory findings indicate a low white blood cell count and platelet count, and the patient has a negative Hepatitis B and C serology. Key features to diagnose this disease include the presence of splenomegaly, pancytopenia, and pipestem fibrosis on ultrasound of the liver.\nSickle cell disease typically presents with chronic, painful leg ulcers, often on the ankles, with surrounding skin hyperpigmentation. It is characterized by episodes of acute illness against a background of progressive organ damage due to the tendency of abnormal hemoglobin S to polymerize in hypoxic conditions, leading to reduced erythrocyte flexibility and vaso-occlusion. The disease manifests in adulthood with slow-healing ulcers, common colonization with pathogenic bacteria, and periosteal reaction. Differential diagnoses include tropical ulcer, diabetic ulcer, and chronic osteomyelitis with discharging sinus. Diagnosis is confirmed by haemoglobin electrophoresis showing a homozygous HbSS-type. Key findings to diagnose sickle cell disease include the presence of irreversibly sickled cells on a blood film, high white cell counts, and a positive sickling test.\nHyperreactive malarial splenomegaly (HMS) is a condition that primarily occurs in tropical regions with stable malaria transmission, characterized by massive splenomegaly and hypersplenism due to an abnormal immune response to repeated infections with Plasmodium species. Clinical presentation may include symptoms of anemia, abdominal heaviness or discomfort, and episodes of low-grade fever. Laboratory findings typically include anemia, bi- or pancytopenia, and elevated IgM levels. Key diagnostic findings include splenomegaly, elevated antimalarial antibodies, and a favorable response to antimalarial prophylaxis. Important differential diagnoses include lymphoma, chronic myeloid leukemia, myelofibrosis, hemoglobinopathies, schistosomiasis, and visceral leishmaniasis. Treatment involves antimalarial prophylaxis for the duration of exposure, and repeated courses may not be required even after clearance of infection.\nSevere Fever With Thrombocytopenia Syndrome (SFTS) primarily occurs in Japan, China, and Korea, transmitted by tick bites. It typically presents with fever, nausea, diarrhea, arthralgia, myalgia, and neurological symptoms, with laboratory results showing leukopenia, thrombocytopenia, and elevated serum AST, ALT, LDH, and CK levels. Important differential diagnosis includes tick- and mite-borne infectious diseases, such as Japanese spotted fever and scrub typhus. The diagnosis is confirmed by detecting SFTS virus in blood serum by PCR, and the management involves symptomatic and supportive treatment, close monitoring of respiratory condition and blood pressure, and management of thrombocytopenia and secondary bacterial infection.\nTuberculosis pericarditis primarily occurs in sub-Saharan Africa and typically presents with signs of cardiac decompensation, such as tachycardia, pulsus paradoxus, hypotension, impalpable apex beat, raised jugular venous pressure, and quiet heart sounds. Important differential diagnosis includes pericardial effusion due to malignancy, HIV-related Kaposi's sarcoma, or bacterial infections such as pneumonia or endocarditis. The diagnosis is confirmed by ultrasound-guided pericardial aspiration, followed by PCR from the effusion to identify Mycobacterium tuberculosis. Key to managing this condition is therapeutic pericardial aspiration to relieve the pressure on the heart, antituberculous treatment, corticosteroids, and antiretroviral therapy for HIV-positive patients.\nA 23-year-old HIV-positive Zambian woman presented with a new-onset seizure. The clinical presentation included a single convulsive seizure lasting 5-10 minutes, without any focal neurological deficits. CSF examination was normal apart from a slightly raised protein level.

Testing should be done with caution, and samples should be sent to a specialized laboratory for PCR. The patient is treated with supportive care and resuscitation, and strict infection control measures should be followed.\nThe patient presents with skin lesions and breathlessness, which are typical for Kaposi's sarcoma (KS), particularly in a newly diagnosed HIV-infected patient. Important differential diagnoses include tuberculosis, which should be vigorously excluded due to the chronic history of cough. The diagnosis of cutaneous disease is often made by clinical appearance, though biopsy is recommended.\nHantavirus Cardiopulmonary Syndrome (HCPS) primarily occurs in the border region between Chile and Argentina, and typically presents with non-specific prodromal symptoms followed by rapidly progressing respiratory failure and precipitous haemodynamic instability. The clinical course varies from a mild disease to its most severe form, HCPS, which is characterized by microvascular leakage and is mainly attributed to host immune response. Diagnosis is confirmed by RT-PCR from whole blood or by serology with presence of specific IgM antibodies or at least a 4-fold increase in IgG titres in paired samples. The mainstay of treatment is organ supportive therapy, and patients should be transferred to a tertiary intensive care unit immediately upon suspicion of ANDV infection. Important differential diagnoses include influenza, hantavirus infections, other respiratory viruses, pneumococcal pneumonia, rickettsial diseases, severe malaria, histoplasmosis, and cryptococcosis.\nHyperreactive malarial splenomegaly (HMS) is a condition that primarily occurs in tropical regions with stable malaria transmission, characterized by massive splenomegaly and hypersplenism due to an abnormal immune response to repeated infections with Plasmodium species. Clinical presentation may include symptoms of anemia, abdominal heaviness or discomfort, and episodes of low-grade fever. Laboratory findings typically include anemia, bi- or pancytopenia, and elevated IgM levels. Key diagnostic findings include splenomegaly, elevated antimalarial antibodies, and a favorable response to antimalarial prophylaxis. Important differential diagnoses include lymphoma, chronic myeloid leukemia, myelofibrosis, hemoglobinopathies, schistosomiasis, and visceral leishmaniasis. Treatment involves antimalarial prophylaxis for the duration of exposure, and repeated courses may not be required even after clearance of infection.\nKnowlesi malaria primarily affects individuals traveling to or living in Southeast Asia and is characterized by quotidian fever, high parasitemias, and severe disease manifestations. Important differential diagnoses include dengue fever, chikungunya, Zika, influenza, acute HIV infection, enteric fever, and non-falciparum malaria. Diagnosis of Knowlesi malaria involves microscopy (thick and thin films) showing Plasmodium species trophozoites, confirmed by species-specific polymerase chain reaction (PCR), with treatment involving atovaquone/proguanil for 3 days.\nNeurolathyrism is a preventable toxic myelopathy caused by excessive ingestion of the Lathyrus sativus grass pea, primarily affecting young male farmers in drought-prone areas. The clinical presentation includes irreversible acute to subacute spastic paraparesis or quadriparesis without prominent sensory involvement. Diagnosis is based on history of consumption of Lathyrus sativus, absence of other causes of myelopathy, and elimination of other differential diagnoses. The diagnosis is supported by laboratory tests such as full blood count, liver and renal function tests, cerebrospinal fluid, nerve conduction studies, and electromyography, which are normal. The differential diagnoses include HTLV-associated myelopathy, neurocassavism, and compressive myelopathy. The management of neurolathyrism is symptomatic and includes the use of anti-spastic drugs, physiotherapy, and tendon and muscle release surgery. Education to avoid consumption of Lathyrus sativus and measures to reduce toxin burden are important public health interventions.\n"

In immunocompromised patients, including those with HTLV-1 infection, it can lead to severe strongyloides hyperinfection syndrome with disseminated disease, characterized by the invasion of extraintestinal tissues, a rapid progression, and a high lethality. The diagnosis is based on parasitological examination, including Baermann testing for rhabditiform larvae, and confirmed by serology for HTLV-1. The treatment of choice is ivermectin given over prolonged periods of time, in combination with broad-spectrum antibiotics in cases of disseminated disease. Close follow-up and screening of family members are crucial.\nScrub typhus primarily occurs in the Asia-Pacific region and is transmitted by the bite of an infected larva (chigger) of a trombiculid mite. Infected patients typically present with fever, severe headache, myalgia, regional or generalized lymphadenopathy, and a macular or maculopapular rash. CNS involvement is common, with presentations including diffuse encephalopathy, reversible sensorineural deafness, and extrapyramidal manifestations. Diagnosis is challenging and often relies on clinical evidence, with serological tests available in some settings. Standard treatment is with doxycycline 100 mg bid for 1 week, and the disease is responsive to antibiotic treatment.\nThe patient is a 40-year-old male farmer from Peru, presenting with a chronic productive cough, weight loss, and cervical lymphadenopathy. Despite initial treatment for pulmonary tuberculosis (TB), he showed no clinical improvement. The most likely diagnosis is chronic (adult) paracoccidioidomycosis, caused by the fungus Paracoccidioides brasiliensis. The disease is endemic in the moist tropical regions of Latin America and is characterized by pulmonary symptoms that slowly develop over months, typically in middle-aged men living in rural endemic areas, which are often accompanied by mucosal lesions. Differential diagnoses include multi-drug resistant TB and histoplasmosis. The diagnosis is confirmed by visualization of P. brasiliensis on wet preparation of specimen and/or isolation in fungal culture. Treatment involves azoles for mild and moderate cases, with itraconazole being the drug of choice, and amphotericin B for severe and extensive disease. Cure is determined based upon four criteria: clinical, mycological, radiological, and immunological.\nHantavirus Cardiopulmonary Syndrome (HCPS) primarily occurs in the border region between Chile and Argentina, and typically presents with non-specific prodromal symptoms followed by rapidly progressing respiratory failure and precipitous haemodynamic instability.

         "Text": "A 58 year old man presented at the emergency room with a two‐day history of headache, sore throat, cough, and fever. He had a past medical history of uncontrolled diabetes mellitus, hypertension, bronchial asthma, and chronic otitis media. He required an automastoidectomy for the chronic otitis media, complicated by a tegmen tympani defect and secondary pseudomeningocele formation communicating with the left temporal horn He had bacterial meningitis 6 years ago, complicated by hydrocephalus that required a temporary external ventricular shunt placement. The patient was initially managed as a case of upper respiratory tract infection and discharged on the same day with a course of oral antibiotics. He returned to the emergency room 1 day later because of worsening headache and vomiting associated with altered sensorium. The patient was well built but sick‐looking. His systolic blood pressure was 160/75 mm Hg, heart rate 110 beats/min, respiratory rate 27/min, the temperature 38°C, and oxygen saturation 96% at room air. His initial neurological examination revealed no eye‐opening to pain, and he produced sounds only as a verbal response. His pupils' size was 4 mm and reactive to light, and he blinked to a threat in both eyes. With the fundus examination, there was bilateral papilledema. He had a normal vestibulo‐ocular reflex, positive corneal reflex, no facial asymmetry, the gag reflex was preserved, and in response to painful stimulus on the sternum, he showed withdrawal response bilaterally. He had nuchal rigidity with positive Brudzinski and Kernig signs. His arterial blood gas results showed a pH of 7.512, pCO2 of 30.8 mmHg, pO2 of 80.2 mmHg, and an HCO3 of 24.1 nmol/L. The laboratory results were significant with the WBC count of 13,000 cells/μL, the lactic acid was 2.49 mmol/L (0.5–2.2 mmol/L), and the potassium was 2.7 mmol/L (3.6–5.2 mmol/L).* The other laboratory parameters including hemoglobin, platelets, renal function, liver function, coagulation profile and cardiac enzymes were within normal limits. Initial brain computerized tomography (CT) scan showed no significant abnormality. Following the brain CT, a lumbar puncture was performed. The appearance of the CSF was a thick yellow liquid resembling pus (Figure 2). The CSF WBC count was 158,000 cells/μL (0–5 cells/μL), the CSF protein 18.67 mg/mL (0.15 to 0.6 mg/mL), the CSF lactic acid 42.37 mmol/L (0–3 mmol/L), the CSF glucose 0.1 mg/100 mL (50–80 mg/100 mL), the CSF RBCs were less than 1 RBC/mm3 (<1 RBC/mm3), and the CSF culture indicated S. pneumoniae (see endnote 1). He was started on a regimen with intravenous meropenem 2000 mg every 8 h and intravenous vancomycin 1200 mg every 8 h, and dexamethasone 12 mg every 6 h. He was also given one dose of intravenous metronidazole 1200 mg once. Intravenous ceftriaxone 2000 mg every 12 h was also added to the regimen. Due to respiratory failure, he was intubated with an endotracheal tube and transferred to an intensive care unit. On the second day of admission, his level of consciousness deteriorated, and his Glasgow Coma Scale (GCS) was 3 out of 15. A repeated brain CT scan showed multiple hypodensities and brain venogram revealed multiple filling defects in the superior sagittal sinus and left transverse sinus (Figure 3). The brain magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) showed extensive gyriform diffusion restriction abnormality involving the frontal, anterior temporal lobes, insular cortices, and bilateral deep gray nuclei and brainstem suggestive of meningoencephalitis with gyriform hemorrhagic foci in the insula and frontal lobes Multiple small collections were also noted along the leptomeningeal surface of the brain stem and cerebellar convexities representing exudates.",

      "ground_truth": "The patient presented with an acute febrile illness, severe headache, altered mental status, and classic meningeal signs (neck stiffness, positive Kernig and Brudzinski signs). Cerebrospinal fluid analysis showed purulent appearance, extremely elevated leukocyte count, markedly increased protein, very low glucose, and high lactate, all characteristic of acute bacterial meningitis. Definitive diagnosis was confirmed by CSF culture growing Streptococcus pneumoniae, consistent with his risk factors of chronic otitis media and prior neurosurgical complications.",
      "answer": "The final diagnosis for this patient is acute bacterial meningitis caused by Streptococcus pneumoniae, complicated by severe neurological deterioration and disseminated intravascular coagulation (DIC). The thick yellow CSF resembling pus, elevated WBC count (158,000 cells/μL), elevated protein (18.67 mg/dL), low glucose (0.1 mg/dL), and high lactic acid (42.37 mmol/L) along with the positive culture for S. pneumoniae confirmed the diagnosis. The rapid deterioration with worsening headache, altered sensorium, papilledema, and the development of multiple hypodensities on brain CT and MRI, along with the signs of DIC, led to the severe neurological decline and poor outcome.",
