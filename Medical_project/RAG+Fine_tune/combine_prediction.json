In April 2014, he and his team established an EVD care unit in Monrovia, and patients with confirmed EVD began arriving at this facility on June 11, 2014. On July 23, 2014, he awoke feeling febrile and fatigued; his oral temperature was 37.8°C. He reported his symptoms to colleagues and remained at home. Results on two rapid diagnostic tests for malaria (Standard Diagnostics) were negative. He started empirical malaria treatment with artemether and lumefantrine. Later that day, his oral temperature was 38.6°C, and nausea developed. He was tested for malaria by means of a rapid diagnostic test and for yellow fever, Lassa fever, and EBOV by means of semiquantitative real-time reverse-transcriptase–polymerase-chain-reaction (RT-PCR) assays, all of which were performed at the Liberian National Reference Laboratory. The results for all the tests were negative.",

      "ground_truth": "Despite initially negative RT-PCR results, the patient had high-risk occupational exposure while working in an Ebola treatment unit in Liberia during an active outbreak and developed an acute febrile illness with systemic symptoms. Early testing for EBOV can be falsely negative because viral loads may be below the detection threshold in the first days of illness. The epidemiologic context and compatible clinical presentation strongly support Ebola virus disease over other tropical infections.",
      "answer": "The final diagnosis for this 33-year-old male physician from Liberia is malaria. Despite his exposure to Ebola virus disease (EVD) and the presence of fever, fatigue, and a generalized maculopapular rash, which initially raised suspicion for EVD, the rapid diagnostic tests for malaria were negative, and the clinical picture was consistent with malaria. The absence of significant lymphadenopathy and the negative results for other arboviruses like Zika, Dengue, and Chikungunya further support this diagnosis.",

Yellow fever is repeatedly described in a Peruvian logger with acute liver failure, jaundice, bleeding, encephalopathy, and seizures, transmitted by Aedes/Haemagogus mosquitoes. Diagnosis is confirmed by IgM capture ELISA, with differentials including severe malaria, viral hepatitis, leptospirosis, and dengue hemorrhagic fever. Brucellosis presents as a chronic febrile illness with sweats, fatigue, lymphadenopathy, hepatosplenomegaly, and frequent ostearticular involvement; diagnosis requires culture of Brucella spp., and treatment involves prolonged combination antibiotics (e.g., doxycycline, rifampicin). Mpox (monkeypox) is characterized by uniform vesiculopustular rash, including palms, soles, and oral mucosa, with progression from macules to pustules; key differentials include smallpox, cowpox, and varicella. Knowlesi malaria (Southeast Asia) causes quotidian fever and high parasitemia, diagnosed via microscopy and PCR, treated with atovaquone–proguanil. Hyperreactive malarial splenomegaly occurs in areas of stable malaria transmission, causing massive splenomegaly, anemia, cytopenias, and elevated IgM, responding to antimalarial prophylaxis.

Migratory cutaneous swellings, creeping eruption, and eosinophilia, with possible CNS involvement, indicate gnathostomiasis, diagnosed by exposure history, eosinophilia, and serology, and treated with albendazole or ivermectin, with corticosteroids for CNS disease. Cholangiocarcinoma is associated with liver fluke infection (Opisthorchis viverrini), suggested by elevated CA19-9 and confirmed by histology and parasite detection in the bile duct. Rapidly progressive painless orbital or jaw tumors in malaria-endemic regions are characteristic of Burkitt lymphoma, diagnosed by biopsy showing monomorphic tumor cells. Fever, weight loss, hepatomegaly, eosinophilia, and hypodense liver lesions are consistent with fascioliasis, diagnosed by serology and stool microscopy, and treated with triclabendazole. Chronic painful leg ulcers with anemia and vaso-occlusive features indicate sickle cell disease, confirmed by hemoglobin electrophoresis. Severe mucocutaneous disease with conjunctivitis and epidermal necrosis suggests Stevens–Johnson syndrome or toxic epidermal necrolysis, diagnosed clinically and managed with immediate drug withdrawal and supportive care. A generalized non-itchy rash involving the palms is consistent with secondary syphilis, diagnosed by positive treponemal serology and treated with benzathine penicillin. Upper gastrointestinal bleeding with splenomegaly and pancytopenia indicates portal hypertension, confirmed by endoscopy showing esophageal varices, with imaging showing pipestem fibrosis. Rapidly progressive meningitis with purpuric rash, shock, and pig exposure is consistent with Streptococcus suis meningitis, confirmed by CSF culture and treated with ceftriaxone. Acute liver failure with jaundice, bleeding, encephalopathy, and seizures after jungle exposure indicates yellow fever, confirmed by IgM capture ELISA. Spastic paraparesis without sensory loss following consumption of Lathyrus sativus indicates neurolathyrism, diagnosed clinically and managed symptomatically. Renal failure with hydronephrosis and bladder granulomas in freshwater exposure suggests urogenital schistosomiasis, diagnosed by imaging and cystoscopy."

She felt numbness at the tip of her fingers and toes for 4 days, but denied contact with any chemicals. Thirty years ago, she spent a week at her father-in-law's house after he was diagnosed with leprosy. No other family members or relatives showed symptom. Skin examination revealed asymmetrical, multiple, discrete, poorly defined borders and hyperpigmented plaques with decreased sensation on her back, nose, and both cheeks, loss of the outer two-thirds of both eyebrows, and infiltrated plaques on both earlobes. Neurological examination revealed a decrease in sensation of pain and temperature at the tips of her fingers and toes. Other physical examinations and peripheral nerve findings were unremarkable. At this stage, the provisional diagnosis of the patient's illness was leprosy. We then obtained slit skin smears of both earlobes and plaques of the skin on her back.

The patient worked as a mechanic, had no pets, no recent travel history and no unusual contacts or hobbies. In the preceding 4 weeks and prior to his deterioration, he had presented on two separate occasions to a hospital emergency department – once to hospital A and once to hospital B, a different hospital in the city. At the first visit, which was to hospital A, the patient reported a mild headache, which responded to analgesia with no red flag symptoms. Blood tests were taken, including a routine opt-out bloodborne viral (BBV) screen. The patient was discharged from the ED. The BBV screen was subsequently reported as reactive for HIV antigen and antibody. Multiple unsuccessful attempts were made by staff to contact the patient by telephone and post. Two weeks later, the patient was brought back to the emergency department of hospital A. He presented with reduced consciousness.

The physical exam during his current presentation revealed marked edema of the distal right lower extremity, multiple granulomatous foci, and two well-healed scars along the medial and lateral aspects of the calf, attributable to his previous surgical debridement from 2018 (Figure 1). He had full strength and sensation in the affected extremity without any discernible deficits. There were no signs indicative of a systemic infection, and the patient’s vital signs remained stable. A computed tomography (CT) scan was completed, showing superficial compartment edema of the posterior distal lower extremity, along with an irregular heterogenous collection in the posteriomedial calf (Figure 2).

      "ground_truth": "The patient presented with an acute hepatitis syndrome characterized by fatigue, jaundice, dark urine, and markedly elevated transaminases and bilirubin levels. A strongly positive anti-HCV antibody supports recent hepatitis C virus exposure, while the initially negative HCV RNA is consistent with very early acute infection or transient low-level viremia below the detection threshold. The clinical presentation and laboratory pattern are most consistent with acute hepatitis C rather than chronic disease.",
      "answer": "The final diagnosis for this patient is Chronic Hepatitis C. The positive HCV RNA and negative HCV RNA load indicate active viral replication, while the negative HCV RNA load and negative Anti-HCV at 7.23 S/CO indicate past infection or a false-positive result. The elevated liver enzymes (ALT 992.8 U/L, AST 546.7 U/L), elevated TBIL (129.8 umol/L), and positive Anti-HCV confirm chronic hepatitis C. The absence of significant acute hepatitis features and the presence of chronic liver disease make acute hepatitis less likely.",

         "Text": "A 58 year old man presented at the emergency room with a two‐day history of headache, sore throat, cough, and fever. He had a past medical history of uncontrolled diabetes mellitus, hypertension, bronchial asthma, and chronic otitis media. He required an automastoidectomy for the chronic otitis media, complicated by a tegmen tympani defect and secondary pseudomeningocele formation communicating with the left temporal horn He had bacterial meningitis 6 years ago, complicated by hydrocephalus that required a temporary external ventricular shunt placement. The patient was initially managed as a case of upper respiratory tract infection and discharged on the same day with a course of oral antibiotics. He returned to the emergency room 1 day later because of worsening headache and vomiting associated with altered sensorium. The patient was well built but sick‐looking. His systolic blood pressure was 160/75 mm Hg, heart rate 110 beats/min, respiratory rate 27/min, the temperature 38°C, and oxygen saturation 96% at room air. His initial neurological examination revealed no eye‐opening to pain, and he produced sounds only as a verbal response. His pupils' size was 4 mm and reactive to light, and he blinked to a threat in both eyes. With the fundus examination, there was bilateral papilledema. He had a normal vestibulo‐ocular reflex, positive corneal reflex, no facial asymmetry, the gag reflex was preserved, and in response to painful stimulus on the sternum, he showed withdrawal response bilaterally. He had nuchal rigidity with positive Brudzinski and Kernig signs. His arterial blood gas results showed a pH of 7.512, pCO2 of 30.8 mmHg, pO2 of 80.2 mmHg, and an HCO3 of 24.1 nmol/L. The laboratory results were significant with the WBC count of 13,000 cells/μL, the lactic acid was 2.49 mmol/L (0.5–2.2 mmol/L), and the potassium was 2.7 mmol/L (3.6–5.2 mmol/L).* The other laboratory parameters including hemoglobin, platelets, renal function, liver function, coagulation profile and cardiac enzymes were within normal limits. Initial brain computerized tomography (CT) scan showed no significant abnormality. Following the brain CT, a lumbar puncture was performed. The appearance of the CSF was a thick yellow liquid resembling pus (Figure 2). The CSF WBC count was 158,000 cells/μL (0–5 cells/μL), the CSF protein 18.67 mg/mL (0.15 to 0.6 mg/mL), the CSF lactic acid 42.37 mmol/L (0–3 mmol/L), the CSF glucose 0.1 mg/100 mL (50–80 mg/100 mL), the CSF RBCs were less than 1 RBC/mm3 (<1 RBC/mm3), and the CSF culture indicated S. pneumoniae (see endnote 1). He was started on a regimen with intravenous meropenem 2000 mg every 8 h and intravenous vancomycin 1200 mg every 8 h, and dexamethasone 12 mg every 6 h. He was also given one dose of intravenous metronidazole 1200 mg once. Intravenous ceftriaxone 2000 mg every 12 h was also added to the regimen. Due to respiratory failure, he was intubated with an endotracheal tube and transferred to an intensive care unit. On the second day of admission, his level of consciousness deteriorated, and his Glasgow Coma Scale (GCS) was 3 out of 15. A repeated brain CT scan showed multiple hypodensities and brain venogram revealed multiple filling defects in the superior sagittal sinus and left transverse sinus (Figure 3). The brain magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) showed extensive gyriform diffusion restriction abnormality involving the frontal, anterior temporal lobes, insular cortices, and bilateral deep gray nuclei and brainstem suggestive of meningoencephalitis with gyriform hemorrhagic foci in the insula and frontal lobes Multiple small collections were also noted along the leptomeningeal surface of the brain stem and cerebellar convexities representing exudates.",

      "ground_truth": "The patient presented with an acute febrile illness, severe headache, altered mental status, and classic meningeal signs (neck stiffness, positive Kernig and Brudzinski signs). Cerebrospinal fluid analysis showed purulent appearance, extremely elevated leukocyte count, markedly increased protein, very low glucose, and high lactate, all characteristic of acute bacterial meningitis. Definitive diagnosis was confirmed by CSF culture growing Streptococcus pneumoniae, consistent with his risk factors of chronic otitis media and prior neurosurgical complications.",
      "answer": "The final diagnosis for this patient is acute bacterial meningitis caused by Streptococcus pneumoniae, complicated by severe neurological deterioration and disseminated intravascular coagulation (DIC). The thick yellow CSF resembling pus, elevated WBC count (158,000 cells/μL), elevated protein (18.67 mg/dL), low glucose (0.1 mg/dL), and high lactic acid (42.37 mmol/L) along with the positive culture for S. pneumoniae confirmed the diagnosis. The rapid deterioration with worsening headache, altered sensorium, papilledema, and the development of multiple hypodensities on brain CT and MRI, along with the signs of DIC, led to the severe neurological decline and poor outcome.",
