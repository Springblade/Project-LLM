       "\"A 24-year-old woman from Uganda presents with a febrile illness, sore throat, abdominal pain, diarrhea, and bilateral conjunctivitis, with a history of her husband's recent death from a similar illness. The differential diagnoses include malaria, typhoid fever, invasive meningococcal disease, adenovirus, influenza, measles, Zika virus, and viral hemorrhagic fever (VHF), with Marburg virus disease being a key consideration given the husband's occupation in a gold mine. Testing should be done with caution, and samples should be sent to a specialized laboratory for PCR. The patient is treated with supportive care and resuscitation, and strict infection control measures should be followed.\\nThis patient, a 35-year-old Peruvian logger, presents with acute febrile illness that produces liver failure, jaundice, bleeding, encephalopathy, and seizures. The diagnosis is confirmed by IgM capture ELISA positivity for yellow fever virus, which is a flavivirus transmitted by Aedes and Haemagogus mosquitoes. The symptoms presented include fever, jaundice, coffee-ground vomiting, gross hematuria, and mental obtundation. Clinically, it is characterized by rapid progression to gastrointestinal illness, dehydration, and multiorgan dysfunction. Important differential diagnoses include severe malaria, viral hepatitis, toxin-mediated hepatitis, leptospirosis, and dengue hemorrhagic fever. The diagnosis is confirmed by detection of yellow fever virus through IgM capture ELISA, supported by relevant epidemiological exposure to the virus.\\nThe disease primarily occurs in the Amazonian rainforest and typically presents with acute febrile illness lasting 3-7 days, characterized by chills, headache, retro-orbital and epigastric pain, myalgia, arthralgia, nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, and a maculopapular rash, sometimes followed by desquamation. Haemorrhagic manifestations are rare. Prolonged polyarthralgias, which are suspected to arise from the inflammatory immune response stimulated by the prolonged virus persistence in joint tissues, can occur after the initial fever resolves. Important differential diagnoses include reactive arthritis, viral arthritis, and other alphavirus infections. The diagnosis is confirmed by detection of Mayaro virus RNA using PCR in blood or, beyond the acute phase, by serological detection of specific IgM and IgG antibodies against the Mayaro virus, using a two-step approach with highly sensitive screening assays followed by highly specific confirmatory assays.\\nThe patient, a 51-year-old female traveller, presents with a generalized maculopapular rash, bilateral conjunctivitis, peripheral painful oedema (hands, elbows, knees, and feet), and generalized lymphadenopathy. This presentation is suggestive of an arboviral infection, particularly Zika virus infection. Key findings to diagnose this exact disease include: detection of viral RNA, viral antigen, or specific IgM in blood samples, and seroconversion (rise in IgG) in paired serum samples. The patient's diagnosis was confirmed by PCR and seroconversion, with a rise in anti-Zika IgM and IgG titres.\\nLassa fever primarily occurs in sub-Saharan West Africa, including Liberia, Sierra Leone, Ghana, and Nigeria, and possibly other areas of sub-Saharan West Africa. The disease starts insidiously with fever, body aches, and weakness, often accompanied by sore throat, retrosternal chest pain, abdominal symptoms such as pain, diarrhea, and vomiting, cough, and breathlessness. Conjunctivitis is common, especially late in the disease. Raised liver transaminases are markers of severity and are associated with a higher case fatality rate. Important differential diagnoses include adenovirus infections, measles, Mycoplasma pneumoniae, leptospirosis, and typhoid fever. The diagnosis is confirmed with antigen testing or PCR tests. The treatment is with IV ribavirin, which should be given early in the disease and can be beneficial, but the quality of studies on this are poor.\\n\""

In April 2014, he and his team established an EVD care unit in Monrovia, and patients with confirmed EVD began arriving at this facility on June 11, 2014. On July 23, 2014, he awoke feeling febrile and fatigued; his oral temperature was 37.8°C. He reported his symptoms to colleagues and remained at home. Results on two rapid diagnostic tests for malaria (Standard Diagnostics) were negative. He started empirical malaria treatment with artemether and lumefantrine. Later that day, his oral temperature was 38.6°C, and nausea developed. He was tested for malaria by means of a rapid diagnostic test and for yellow fever, Lassa fever, and EBOV by means of semiquantitative real-time reverse-transcriptase–polymerase-chain-reaction (RT-PCR) assays, all of which were performed at the Liberian National Reference Laboratory. The results for all the tests were negative.\", top_k =5)"
