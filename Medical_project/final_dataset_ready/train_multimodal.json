The rapid deterioration and severe bleeding, as depicted in the image, strongly point towards a filoviral infection like Ebola. However, in this region, it is crucial to consider other primary differential diagnoses with similar haemorrhagic potential, including complicated malaria, typhoid fever, bacterial gastroenteritis, and leptospirosis, all of which can present with fever and bleeding manifestations."

Culturing *H. ducreyi* is challenging because it is a fastidious organism, requiring an enriched culture medium made selective with antibiotics to inhibit other flora. Furthermore, it grows optimally at a specific temperature of 33°C, which deviates from standard incubation temperatures, making its isolation technically demanding."

The low haemoglobin of 9.5 mg/dL suggests anemia, possibly from initial venom-induced haemorrhage, chronic infection, or malnutrition. The low platelet count of 60 x 10^9/L is concerning for ongoing consumption or bone marrow suppression, despite a normal WBCT20. Crucial further investigations include blood cultures to identify systemic bacteremia, wound cultures from the necrotic tissue (as seen in _page_0_Picture_12.jpeg) for targeted antibiotic therapy, and a full coagulation profile (PT/INR, aPTT, fibrinogen) to assess for disseminated intravascular coagulation (DIC). Imaging such as an X-ray or MRI of the foot and ankle would also be valuable to assess for underlying osteomyelitis or deeper tissue involvement."

Nutritional support is vital given her wasted state (BMI 17 kg/m2). Furthermore, her severe anaemia warrants investigation and management of underlying causes such as chronic infection, micronutrient deficiencies, and bone marrow suppression. Regular follow-up for adherence to ART, monitoring of immune status (CD4 count), viral load, and screening for other HIV-related complications are also crucial for her ongoing health."

Other important considerations include a severe bacterial abscess due to Staphylococcus aureus or Streptococcus pyogenes, given the pus discharge and septic appearance. Tuberculosis should also be considered due to the sub-acute nature and respiratory findings, though typical tuberculous abscesses are usually 'cold' without significant pain or erythema. Disseminated fungal infection is less likely but possible if there was additional immunocompromise such as HIV."

For a 7-year-old, the recommended regimen is Rifampicin 10 mg/kg orally once daily, combined with Streptomycin 15 mg/kg intramuscularly once daily. This treatment should be administered for 8 weeks. Adjunctive care includes immediate adequate wound care with daily saline-soaked gauze changes and pain relief. Povidone-iodine may be used for bacterial colonization, and antitetanus coverage must be ensured. Surgical debridement and skin grafting are indicated for large lesions, especially those with necrotic tissue, and physiotherapy is crucial to address contractures, such as the patient's right wrist flexion and abduction."

Tuberculosis, especially disseminated forms, can closely mimic VL, while HIV can predispose to chronic infections and constitutional symptoms, often presenting with lymphadenopathy. While less likely due to certain atypical features like the duration of fever or absence of typical rash, typhoid fever and malignancies like leukemia or lymphoma also remain on the differential for chronic fever, splenomegaly (4 cm below the left costal margin), generalized lymphadenopathy (1 cm nodes), and pancytopenia (WBC 1.35 x10^9/L, Hb 6.8 g/dL, Platelets 98 x10^9/L) in a child, requiring careful exclusion in a comprehensive workup."

        "content": "The rationale for not initiating anthelmintic treatment with albendazole three years prior was based on the observation that both cyst walls were described as calcified. The bioavailability and efficacy of albendazole are significantly diminished in cysts with calcified walls, rendering the treatment less effective for such lesions. This decision, while aligned with the understanding that calcified cysts might be inactive, highlights a critical point: partial calcification or the presence of a viable CE1 cyst (despite surrounding calcification) can still lead to acute complications. His current presentation of a cystobiliary fistula and cholangitis underscores that even long-standing or partially calcified cysts require careful monitoring due to the potential for acute, severe complications."

The pronator drift occurs because the supinator muscles are weaker than the pronator muscles, leading to the arm drifting downwards and pronating when extended with eyes closed. This specific finding, coupled with the spastic hemiparesis and hyperreflexia, strongly localizes the lesion to the patient's brain, likely affecting the motor cortex or its descending tracts."

Firstly, she should receive anti-schistosomal treatment with praziquantel (40 mg/kg orally, single dose or in two divided doses) to eliminate the adult worms and prevent further progression of liver fibrosis. Secondly, primary or secondary prophylaxis against variceal re-bleeding is crucial, often with non-selective beta-blockers like propranolol (initial dose 20 mg PO BID, titrated to reduce heart rate by 25% or to a maximum tolerated dose). Regular endoscopic surveillance may be needed to monitor for recurrent varices, and if available, further interventions like shunt surgery could be considered for refractory cases. Furthermore, education on avoiding re-infection by limiting contact with contaminated water sources is vital in an endemic region like Malawi."

This extensive mucosal damage results in severe inflammation, villous atrophy, and impaired absorption, which explains the D-xylose test showing malabsorption. The damage also causes significant protein loss into the gut lumen, manifesting as severe hypoalbuminemia (23 g/L) and contributing to the pitting oedema.

Initial management may involve intermittent self-catheterization or indwelling catheterization to prevent urinary retention and complications like hydronephrosis. Alpha-blockers may be considered to improve bladder emptying. Follow-up is crucial and should include repeat neurological examinations to monitor for improvement or worsening of symptoms. Repeat MRI imaging of the spinal cord after several months (e.g., 3-6 months) would be necessary to assess the resolution of the enhancing lesion and oedema seen in _page_1_Picture_12.jpeg, guiding the duration of corticosteroid therapy and evaluating treatment efficacy."

A common regimen is Proguanil 200 mg orally once daily. Alternatively, Doxycycline 100 mg orally once daily or Atovaquone/Proguanil (Malarone) at standard prophylactic doses could be used. The duration of treatment is typically long-term, often for several months to years, or as long as the patient remains in an endemic area or at risk of re-exposure. The goal is to reduce the immunological stimulus leading to splenomegaly and hypersplenism, thereby decreasing spleen size and improving cytopenias."

Chikungunya commonly causes severe polyarthralgias/arthritis and often a high fever, but not typically the non-purulent conjunctivitis or extensive peripheral oedema seen here.

Localized bacterial skin and soft-tissue infections such as folliculitides, furuncles, carbuncles, or abscesses are common, especially in travelers returning from hot, humid climates with potential hygiene challenges. Spider bites, such as from a brown recluse spider, can cause lesions with central necrosis similar to an eschar; however, the slow growth over several weeks makes this less likely. Although rickettsial disease or cutaneous anthrax can present with an eschar-like lesion, the absence of systemic symptoms like fever makes these diagnoses improbable in this afebrile patient."

Immature larvae are often left to develop for a short period as they are harder to retrieve, and maceration during removal can lead to inflammation and secondary infection. After successful extrusion or development, the larva can then be easily removed with forceps."
