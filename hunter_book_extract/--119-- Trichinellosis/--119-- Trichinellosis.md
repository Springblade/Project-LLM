# **119** Trichinellosis

*Fabrizio Bruschi, K. Darwin Murrell*

#### KEY FEATURES

- • Trichinellosis (also called trichinosis) is caused by the nematode *Trichinella.*
- • It is acquired by humans after eating the muscle of wild or domestic animals harboring the larval stage of the parasite.
- • Severity of disease is usually proportional to the number of larvae ingested; disease is characterized by fever, gastrointestinal symptoms, myositis, swollen eyelids, and eosinophilia.
- • Diagnosis is made by muscle biopsy or a highly specific serologic test (e.g., Western blot).
- • Treatment involves symptom management, corticosteroids, and anti-helminthics (albendazole or mebendazole).

### **INTRODUCTION**

Trichinellosis has been a zoonotic disease for thousands of years, acquired by humans from eating insufficiently cooked infected meat. The nine species (recently, *Trichinella patagoniensis* was discovered) of *Trichinella* responsible for infection occur in many wild and domestic animals distributed throughout the Arctic, as well as temperate and tropical zones.[1](#page-2-0) Virtually all mammals are susceptible to infection, although only humans appear to be prone to developing clinical disease. Although cases are declining in developed countries, outbreaks continue to be reported in developing regions, especially Southeast Asia, Latin America, and Africa.[2](#page-2-1)

#### **EPIDEMIOLOGY**

Trichinellosis is an important food-borne zoonosis because of the economic burden associated with preventing it from entering the human food chain, particularly from domestic swine (meat inspection). The prevalence of swine infection due to *T. spiralis* has greatly diminished because of the widespread adoption of modern pig-rearing systems that do not feed pigs with contaminated meat[.2,3](#page-2-1) However, outbreaks due to infected horsemeat and game animals (e.g., bear) frequently occur.[3](#page-2-2) Infective encysted larvae can remain viable in the host's musculature for several years (depending on host species).

A feature of *Trichinella* epidemiology is the existence of two normally separate ecological systems: sylvatic and domestic. Only *T. spiralis* is highly infective to pigs; consequently, commercial and backyard pig production needs to have stringent barriers to exposure to wild animals, especially commensal rats, and uncooked meat scraps[.3](#page-2-2) Cooking meat to 160°F is sufficient to kill larvae, and except for *T. nativa,* freezing meat is also effective in protecting consumers.

# **NATURAL HISTORY, PATHOGENESIS, AND PATHOLOGY**

When humans consume raw or undercooked flesh infected with L1 *Trichinella* larvae ([Fig. 119.1](#page-1-0)), these are freed from muscle by digestion. The larvae, which are resistant to gastric acid, pass into the small intestine, burrow beneath the columnar epithelium, and lie just above the lamina propria. There, they undergo four molts and develop into adult worms, male and female, which mate. After fertilization, the females begin to discharge juvenile L1 larvae (newborn larvae) for a period of 4 to 16 weeks or more, depending on host species, until the adult worms are finally expelled from the intestine. The longevity of adult worms in the human intestine is not known.

Newborn larvae make their way into the lamina propria to a draining lymph node or blood vessel and are carried to the arterial circulation via the thoracic duct. Larvae then invade striated skeletal muscle cells, where, after invasion, they induce changes that culminate in a new cell phenotype termed the *nurse cell,* which in the case of the encapsulated *Trichinella* spp. is surrounded by a collagenous capsule. After 21 days, the larvae are fully infective and resistant to gastric juice. In humans, calcification of the cyst may begin within 6 months to a year, a process that eventually is followed by the death of the encysted larvae.

# **CLINICAL FEATURES**

The degree of illness is usually related to the number of larvae per gram of muscle. This ranges from 10 (light, sub-clinical infections), to 50 to 500 (moderate infections), up to 1000 or more larvae (severe, life-threatening infections). Most human infections with *Trichinella* have been attributed to *T. spiralis,* which causes more severe disease in contrast to *T. nelsoni* and *T. britovi.*[4](#page-2-3)

The symptoms of trichinellosis can be divided into an early intestinal phase, a later phase associated with inflammatory and allergic responses caused by muscle invasion, and a convalescent phase. The incubation period ranges from 5 to 51 days. After this, gastrointestinal symptoms with fever occur, followed by myalgia, periorbital edema, and eosinophilia (i.e., the trichinellotic syndrome). Acute infection lasts 1 to 8 weeks and may have a mild, moderate, or severe course, depending on fever severity and duration, intensity of symptoms, time taken to recover from disease, and presence of complications.

#### **Intestinal or Enteral Phase**

This occurs within the first week after ingestion of L1 larvae in inadequately cooked meat [\(Table 119.1](#page-1-1)). The symptoms reflect mucosal irritation as adult worms develop in the small intestine. They include nausea, abdominal cramps, loss of appetite, vomiting, low-grade fever, and either mild diarrhea or constipation. Frontal headache, dizziness, and weakness can also occur, especially in light to moderate infections. Severe diarrhea, persisting for weeks, can be seen in heavy infections[.5](#page-2-4)

#### **Muscle Invasion or Parenteral Phase**

This stage, beginning as early as 9 to 10 days after exposure, is associated with penetration of the newborn larvae into muscle cells. A myositis is initiated with neutrophils, eosinophils, lymphocytes, and macrophages, with enlarged and edematous muscle fibers. It especially occurs in the extraocular muscles; masseters; muscles of the larynx, tongue, diaphragm, and neck; intercostals; and muscular attachments to tendons and joints. This process reaches its peak at about 5 to 6 weeks and diminishes when the larvae become encapsulated.

| 9–28                                          | Muscle                   | Muscular pain, facial edema, fever,<br>chills, tachycardia, coma,<br>respiratory difficulties, eosinophilia |  |  |

Early symptoms are swelling of the eyelids and facial edema. After this, muscle swelling, tenderness, pain on movement, and fever can develop. Headache, fainting, urticaria, splinter hemorrhages, conjunctivitis, loss of appetite, hoarseness, dysphagia, dyspnea, and edema of the legs can also occur. Fever can be delayed until several weeks after infection, but temperature may eventually reach 104°F for a week or more in heavy infections.

Pain is most severe between the second and fourth weeks of infection but may persist for a longer period and can be intense enough to make chewing, talking, and swallowing difficult. Respiratory symptoms, including dyspnea, result from involvement of respiratory muscles, and myocarditis, sometimes fatal, can result from larval invasion of the heart: but immunopathologic processes could also play a role.

#### **Neurologic Complications**

Neurologic symptoms can accompany migration of the larvae through central nervous system tissue, resulting in intracerebral hemorrhage and meningitis. Patients can exhibit dizziness, ataxia, hysteria, psychotic disturbances, seizures, monoparesis, and eventually coma in severe infections.

#### **Convalescent Phase**

In the second month after infection, myalgia, along with fever and itching, decreases. At this time, evidence of congestive heart failure may appear, especially if the patient becomes active too soon. Larvae remain alive in the cysts for one or more years, depending on the species, even after the cyst wall becomes calcified. Larvae release antigens that lead to a persistent low to moderate eosinophilia and stimulate specific circulating antibody. Fatal outcome is infrequent in trichinellosis, normally occurring only in massive infections, and is most frequently associated with myocarditis, encephalitis, and pneumonitis. In the period 2002–2007, of 66 cases of trichinellosis reported in the United States, no fatalities were reported.[6](#page-2-5)

# **PATIENT EVALUATION, DIAGNOSIS, AND DIFFERENTIAL DIAGNOSIS**

An algorithm for the identification of trichinellosis cases ([Table](#page-2-6) [119.2](#page-2-6)), as well as one for chronic trichinellosis and sequelae, has been developed by Dupouy-Camet and Bruschi[.7](#page-2-7) Diagnosis can be made by indirect or direct demonstration of infection. The presence of specific antibody, along with eosinophilia, leukocytosis, elevated levels of muscle enzymes, and increased immunoglobulin levels, especially total IgE, are the most characteristic laboratory findings.

#### **Indirect Diagnosis**

Circulating antibody can be detected even in lightly infected patients 3 to 4 weeks after infection and as early as 2 weeks in heavily infected individuals. The fluorescent antibody test and

enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) using larval E/S (excretory/secretory) antigen are the most reliable serologic tests for screening.[8](#page-2-8) ELISA-positive results should be confirmed by Western blot, with reactivity against the TSL-1 antigen family (48–55 kDa and/or 59–63 and/or 64–72 in the reduced form)[.8](#page-2-8)

#### **Direct Diagnosis**

#### Enteral Phase

The parasite cannot be observed in stool but sometimes can be recovered from the intestinal mucosa at autopsy.

# Parenteral Phase

The muscle stage offers the best chance for direct demonstration of worms by a biopsy of a superficial skeletal muscle (preferably the deltoid or gastrocnemius). A specimen measuring approximately 1 cm3 should be taken. A portion of the specimen is fixed and examined histologically. The remainder is processed either by (1) compression between glass slides, followed by microscopic examination, and/or (2) digestion in 1% pepsin and 1% hydrochloric acid, followed by microscopic examination of a filtrate or washed sediment of the digested specimen and (3) molecular typing to determine the *Trichinella* species. In light infections, a negative biopsy does not exclude the possibility of infection.

#### **Differential Diagnosis**

Mild cases of trichinellosis can be misdiagnosed as influenza or other viral fevers. The clinician should recognize a history of recent ingestion of pork or game, febrile myalgia, periorbital edema, and rising eosinophilia (to 50% or higher) and then confirm the diagnosis by either serologic tests or muscle biopsy. Similar symptoms among others who had the same epidemiologic risks reflect a common source of infection and further substantiate the diagnosis.

# **TREATMENT**

Only a limited number of prospective, controlled clinical trials of treatment have been performed, which has led to uncertainties in treatment.[6](#page-2-5) It is also difficult to differentiate the efficacy of drug therapy from natural recovery of infection in mild to moderate cases. Symptomatic treatmen[t6](#page-2-5) includes analgesics, anti-pyretics, bed rest, and corticosteroids (prednisolone at 50 mg/day), especially in severe infections to prevent shocklike symptoms. Antiparasitic treatment[6](#page-2-5) is oral albendazole (400 mg twice a day for 10–15 days) or mebendazole (200–400 mg three times a day for 3 days and then 400–500 mg three times a day for 10 days)[.9](#page-2-9) Factors such as the *Trichinella* species, worm burden, duration of symptoms, and the host's immunocompetence need to be considered. The use of albendazole or mebendazole in young children and during pregnancy should be balanced against the risk of disease progression without therapy.
