# **<sup>115</sup> 115** Loiasis

*Joseph Kamgno, Amy D. Klion*

### KEY FEATURES

- • Loiasis, infection with the filarial nematode *Loa loa,* is endemic in Central and West Africa.
- • Characteristic clinical manifestations include episodic angioedema (Calabar swellings) and subconjunctival migration of adult worms (eyeworm).
- • Microfilariae are found in the peripheral blood during the day.
- • Diethylcarbamazine (DEC) is the treatment of choice and is curative in most cases. It is associated with severe side effects in patients with high levels of circulating microfilariae. Albendazole may be successful in treating DEC-refractory loiasis.
- • Weekly DEC is effective in preventing loiasis in travelers to endemic regions.

# **INTRODUCTION**

*Loa loa* infection was first described by Mongin in 1770, when he extracted an adult worm from the eye of an African slave[.1](#page-3-0) The clinical manifestations were not fully described, however, until 1781 by Guyot. Adult worms migrate through the subcutaneous tissues causing intermittent "Calabar swellings" and sometimes beneath the conjunctiva (hence the popular name *eye worm*). Although many infected people are asymptomatic despite large numbers of blood-borne microfilariae, administration of microfilaricidal agents, including diethylcarbamazine and ivermectin, can cause severe, sometimes fatal, treatment-associated reactions. This risk for adverse treatment reactions in populations co-infected with multiple filariae has created challenges for global elimination programs for lymphatic filariasis and onchocerciasis.

### **EPIDEMIOLOGY**

*Loa loa* is estimated to infect 3 to 13 million people in Central and West Africa with a distribution that mirrors that of its *Chrysops* vectors. Endemic areas are illustrated in [Fig. 115.1.](#page-1-0) Isolated cases have also been reported in Uganda, Malawi, Zambia, and Ethiopia and in the region from Ghana to Guinea. Infection rates increase with age, possibly because of increased exposure to biting flies. Non-human primates harbor a form of *Loa,* but there is no evidence that they act as reservoir hosts for human *Loa loa,* and infection of humans by the simian strain has not been demonstrated.

# **NATURAL HISTORY, PATHOGENESIS, AND PATHOLOGY**

*Loa loa* is transmitted by tabanid flies of the genus *Chrysops,* of which *C. silacea* and *C. dimidiata* are the most important (Fig. [115.2](#page-2-0)). Microfilariae ingested during a blood meal develop over 10 to 12 days into infective filariform (L3) larvae (up to 100 L3 per fly). When the fly bites a new host, larvae are injected and develop into adult worms over 6 to 12 months. The threadlike adult worms migrate through the subcutaneous tissues at rates of up to 1 cm/min and can survive for up to 17 years. Females measure 50 to 70 mm × 0.5 mm, and males 30 to 35 mm × 0.3 to 0.4 mm. The cuticle of the middle region in both sexes has numerous small bumps that aid in identification of worms in biopsies. After sexual mating by adult worms, microfilariae are released into the bloodstream, where they exhibit diurnal periodicity.[2](#page-3-1) Peak microfilarial levels range from undetectable to more than 100,000 parasites/ mL, and are remarkably stable in an individual person over time. *Loa loa* does not harbor the bacterial endosymbiont, *Wolbachia,* found in most other filarial pathogens of humans[.3](#page-3-2)

# **CLINICAL FEATURES**

The clinical spectrum of loiasis is broad, ranging from asymptomatic infection to life-threatening complications. With the exception of eye worm and renal abnormalities (see later), clinical signs and symptoms are more common in visitors to *Loa-*endemic areas than in indigenous people and reflect a heightened immune response to the parasite. Conversely, microfilariae are detectable in the peripheral blood of most endemic individuals with loiasis but are rare in infected visitors.[4](#page-3-3) Familial clustering of microfilarial density in an endemic area in Cameroon suggests that host genetics play a role[.5](#page-3-4)

### **Calabar Swellings**

Recurrent episodes of localized angioedema, or Calabar swellings ([Fig. 115.3\)](#page-2-1), are characteristic of loiasis and are thought to be a hypersensitivity response to parasite antigens. Calabar swellings are most common on the face and extremities, last from a few days to weeks, and may be transiently exacerbated by diethylcarbamazine (DEC) treatment. They are usually painless, except when the swelling causes restriction of joint movement or nerve compression.

#### **Eye Worm**

Subconjunctival migration of the adult eye worm ([Fig. 115.4](#page-2-2)) is usually accompanied by transient swelling of the lid and intense conjunctivitis. Although most episodes resolve spontaneously and completely, rare cases of retinal artery occlusion and macular retinopathy due to aberrant migration of the adult parasite have been reported.

#### **Other Symptoms**

Non-specific systemic symptoms are pruritus, urticaria, myalgia, arthralgia, fatigue, and malaise. Eosinophilia is marked in most infected individuals.[4](#page-3-3)

#### **Complications**

Although serious end organ complications of loiasis are rare (see later), a recent study demonstrated an increased risk of death in infected individuals with microfilaremia.[6](#page-3-5)

#### Central Nervous System

The most serious complication of *Loa loa* infection is meningoencephalitis, which occurs predominantly in patients with high numbers

**Fig. 115.1** Geographic distribution of loiasis. Endemic areas are shaded. Please note that the prevalence of infection within an endemic area is typically focal.

<span id="page-1-0"></span>of circulating microfilariae, especially in the setting of treatment with DEC or ivermectin. The severity of central nervous system involvement ranges from mild headache and meningismus to coma and death. Occasionally, microfilariae are found in the cerebrospinal fluid, and, in fatal cases, degenerating microfilariae have been seen in necrotizing granulomas in the brain. These findings have recently been reproduced in a baboon model of loiasis.[7](#page-3-6)

### Renal

Hematuria and proteinuria are common, and may be due to immune complex glomerulonephritis and/or mechanical trauma resulting from the filtration of large numbers of microfilariae. Transient worsening may occur after DEC treatment, although most cases resolve completely and progression to chronic renal insufficiency is unusual. Microfilariae are occasionally detected in urine.

#### Endomyocardial Fibrosis

Loiasis has been implicated in the etiology of endomyocardial fibrosis (EMF) in equatorial Africa based on geographic overlap in prevalence and high levels of anti-filarial antibodies detected in some individuals with EMF. Clinical resolution of biopsy-proven EMF with anti-filarial therapy has been documented in one patient with loiasis, supporting this association.

#### Other Complications

Transient pulmonary infiltrates and pleural effusion are reported. Other uncommon manifestations are arthritis, lymphangitis, and hydrocele.

# **PATIENT EVALUATION, DIAGNOSIS, AND DIFFERENTIAL DIAGNOSIS**

Loiasis should be considered in individuals with a compatible exposure history and unexplained eosinophilia, Calabar swellings, or an adult worm migrating under the skin or across the eye. Sometimes, the diagnosis is suggested by dead, calcified worms seen on a roentgenogram. Most people have a history of prolonged exposure in an endemic area, although cases have been reported after 1 to 2 weeks in a highly endemic area.

### **Definitive Diagnosis**

Demonstration of *Loa loa* microfilariae in the blood or identification of an adult *Loa loa* worm removed from the subcutaneous tissue is diagnostic. *Loa loa* microfilariae can be distinguished from those of *Wuchereria bancrofti* and *Mansonella perstans* by their diurnal periodicity, their size (approximately 290 × 7.5 µm), the presence of a sheath, and three or more nuclei extending to the tip of the tail [\(Fig. 115.5\)](#page-3-7). Blood should be drawn between 10 AM and 2 PM (with adjustment for recent [<2 weeks] travel from a different time zone) to coincide with peak microfilarial levels. Although microfilariae can be detected in thick blood smears stained with Giemsa or Wright's stain, concentration techniques, including Knott's concentration, saponin lysis, and nucleopore filtration of anticoagulated blood, are useful in patients with low numbers of circulating microfilariae. Species-specific polymerase chain reaction (PCR)–based diagnostics are more sensitive than blood filtration, but are available only in research settings[.8](#page-3-8) Quantitative antigen detection assays that correlate with *Loa loa* microfilaremia and obviate the need for mid-day blood draws are in development[.9](#page-3-9) Rapid point-of-care quantification of *Loa loa* microfilariae in the blood has recently been demonstrated using a cell phone–based videomicroscope[10](#page-3-10) and can be used to identify individuals with high microfilarial levels at risk for severe side effects of microfilaricidal therapy.[11](#page-3-11)

# **Presumptive Diagnosis**

Immunodiagnostic tests are available commercially and at some academic centers, and may be helpful in confirming the diagnosis of filariasis in travelers from endemic areas who have characteristic clinical symptoms or unexplained eosinophilia without detectable blood microfilariae.[12](#page-3-12) Commercially available tests do not distinguish between the human filarial infections or between active infection, past infection, and exposure. The high prevalence of anti-filarial antibodies in residents of *Loa*-endemic areas limits the utility of serologic tests in this group.

#### **Differential Diagnosis**

In the absence of definitive evidence of infection, the diagnosis of loiasis can be difficult. Angioedema mimicking Calabar swellings can be associated with C1 esterase deficiency, other helminth infections such as gnathostomiasis and trichinosis, and allergic diseases. Subconjunctival migration of an adult worm is highly suggestive of loiasis, although other etiologies, including *Dirofilaria repens* and *Thelazia californiensis,* have been described.

#### **TREATMENT AND PREVENTION**

In patients with few or no circulating microfilariae, DEC (8–10 mg/ kg/day for 21 days) is the drug of choice [\(Table 115.1\)](#page-3-13). The drug is not directly toxic to the parasites but works in conjunction with host immune responses to kill microfilariae and adult worms. DEC is curative in most cases, although multiple courses of therapy are often necessary, and relapses have been documented up to 8 years after treatment.[13](#page-3-14) DEC is contraindicated in patients with concomitant onchocerciasis, due to the risk of severe cutaneous and ocular reactions.

Mild side effects, including Calabar swellings, urticaria, arthralgias, fever, and right upper quadrant tenderness, are common during the first few days of DEC therapy and generally respond

Serious complications, including meningoencephalitis and renal failure, are most common in patients with high numbers of circulating microfilariae (>2500/mL)[.14](#page-3-15) Although advocated in the past, neither a gradual increase in DEC dose nor corticosteroid pre-treatment is completely effective in preventing these complications. Cytapheresis can be used to safely reduce the microfilarial load before the initiation of DEC.[15](#page-3-16)

Albendazole is thought to affect adult parasites by inhibiting microtubular function and glucose uptake; it has no effect on microfilariae. At a dose of 200 mg twice daily for 3 weeks, albendazole reduced *Loa* microfilaremia by approximately 80% over the course of several months without adverse effects.[16](#page-3-17) Shorter courses of higher-dose albendazole appear to be less effective[.17](#page-3-18) Albendazole has also been used successfully in DEC-refractory *Loa loa* infection.[18](#page-4-0)

Ivermectin, the treatment of choice for onchocerciasis, has activity against *Loa loa* microfilariae, but little, if any, effect on adult worms. Because ivermectin causes side effects similar to those seen with DEC[19](#page-4-1) but is not curative, it should not be used to treat loiasis. A recent case report suggests that imatinib, a tyrosine kinase inhibitor approved for the treatment of chronic myelogenous leukemia, may lower *Loa loa* microfilarial levels more slowly (and consequently more safely) than DEC or ivermectin[,20](#page-4-2) although definitive conclusions await a larger trial. Doxycycline is ineffective in loiasis due to the absence of the bacterial endosymbiont *Wolbachia.*

Elimination of insect vectors using larvicides has been hampered by the inaccessibility of vector breeding sites; 13 years of mass treatment with ivermectin had no effect on *Chrysops* infection rates in an area highly endemic for loiasis.[21](#page-4-3) Clearance of forest around dwellings, screening houses, and use of protective clothing can reduce personal exposure to *Chrysops* in endemic areas. DEC (300 mg weekly) is effective in preventing loiasis in long-term travelers to endemic areas[.22](#page-4-4)
