#### **INTRODUCTION**

Measles is a highly contagious disease caused by measles virus. Endemic areas are largely confined to the tropics, although outbreaks and deaths continue to occur in temperate zones among unvaccinated individuals. Measles is one of the most important infectious diseases of humans and has caused millions of deaths since its emergence thousands of years ago. Measles virus (genus *Morbillivirus*, family Paramyxoviridae) most closely resembles rinderpest virus, a pathogen of cattle. It is thought to have evolved from an ancestral virus as a zoonotic infection in communities where cattle and humans lived in close proximity. Measles virus is believed to have become established in human populations about 5000 to 10,000 years ago when human populations achieved sufficient size in Middle Eastern river valley civilizations to maintain virus transmission.

#### **EPIDEMIOLOGY**

Remarkable progress has been made in reducing the global measles incidence and mortality as a consequence of measles vaccination ([Fig. 32.1.1\)](#page-1-0).[1](#page-4-0) In the Americas, intensive vaccination and surveillance efforts interrupted endemic transmission of the virus, and measles was declared eliminated in this region in 2016. However, recent outbreaks have led to loss of measles elimination status in the Americas. More recently, progress has been made in other regions as a consequence of increasing routine measles vaccine coverage and provision of a second opportunity for measles vaccination through mass measles vaccination campaigns[.2](#page-4-1)

Measles virus is one of the most highly contagious, directly transmitted pathogens, and outbreaks can occur even in populations in which less than 10% of people are susceptible. There are no latent or persistent measles virus infections that result in prolonged contagiousness and no animal reservoirs for measles virus. Measles virus can only be maintained in human populations by an unbroken chain of acute infections.

Infants become susceptible to measles virus infection when the passively acquired maternal antibody is lost[.3](#page-4-2) The average age of measles patients depends on the rate of contact with infected persons, the rate of decline of protective maternal antibodies, and the vaccine coverage rate. In densely populated urban settings with low vaccination coverage, measles is a disease of infants and young children. As measles vaccine coverage increases or population density decreases, the age distribution shifts toward older children. As vaccination coverage increases further, the age distribution of cases may be shifted into adolescence and adulthood.

When endemic, measles incidence has a typical temporal pattern characterized by yearly seasonal epidemics superimposed upon longer epidemic cycles of 2 to 5 years or more. These cycles result from the accumulation of susceptible persons over successive birth cohorts and the subsequent decline in the number of susceptible people after an outbreak. In the tropics, measles outbreaks have variable relationships with rainy seasons. This seasonality, combined with high birth rates, can result in highly irregular, large outbreaks of measles.[4](#page-4-3)

### **NATURAL HISTORY, PATHOGENESIS, AND PATHOLOGY**

Measles virus is primarily transmitted by respiratory droplets over short distances and, less commonly, by small particle aerosols that remain suspended in the air for long periods. The time from infection to clinical disease is approximately 10 days to the onset of fever and 14 days to the onset of rash. Persons with measles are infectious for several days before and after the onset of rash, when levels of measles virus in blood and body fluids are highest and when the symptoms of cough, coryza, and sneezing are most severe. The host immune response at sites of virus replication is responsible for the signs and symptoms of measles.

Host immune responses to measles virus are essential for viral clearance, clinical recovery, and the establishment of long-term immunity.[5](#page-4-4) The protective efficacy of antibodies to measles virus is illustrated by the immunity conferred to infants from passively acquired maternal antibodies and the protection of exposed, susceptible individuals after administration of anti-measles virus immune globulin. The duration of protective immunity after wild-type measles virus infection is generally lifelong[.6](#page-4-5) The immune responses to measles virus infection are associated with depressed responses to unrelated (non-measles virus) antigens, lasting for several weeks to months. This state of immune suppression enhances susceptibility to secondary bacterial and viral infections causing pneumonia and diarrhea, and is likely responsible for much of measles-associated morbidity and mortality[.7](#page-4-6) Vitamin A deficiency is a recognized risk factor for severe measles. The vitamin is essential for the maintenance of normal epithelial tissues throughout the body; measles virus itself infects and damages these tissues.

#### **CLINICAL FEATURES**

Clinically, features begin with a prodromal illness characterized by fever, cough, coryza, and conjunctivitis (Fig. 32.1.2). Koplik's spots (small white lesions on the buccal mucosa) may be visible during the prodrome and allow the astute clinician to diagnose measles before the onset of rash (Fig. 32.1.3). The prodromal symptoms intensify several days before the onset of rash. A characteristic erythematous and maculopapular rash appears, first on the face and behind the ears, and then spreads, in a centrifugal fashion, to the trunk and extremities (Fig. 32.1.4). The rash lasts for 3 to 4 days and fades in the same manner as it appeared. Malnourished children may develop a deeply pigmented rash that desquamates or peels during recovery.<sup>8</sup>

<span id="page-1-2"></span>In uncomplicated measles, clinical recovery begins soon after appearance of the rash. Complications can occur in up to 40% of measles cases; the risk of complication is increased by extremes of age and malnutrition (Fig. 32.1.5). The respiratory tract is a frequent site of complication, with pneumonia accounting for most measles-associated deaths. Pneumonia is caused by secondary viral or bacterial infections or by the measles virus itself. Other respiratory complications include laryngotracheobronchitis (croup) and otitis media. Mouth ulcers, or stomatitis, may hinder children from eating or drinking. Many children with measles develop diarrhea, which further contributes to malnutrition. Keratoconjunctivitis is common after measles, particularly in children with vitamin A deficiency, and was a frequent cause of blindness. <sup>10</sup>

Because the measles rash is a consequence of the cellular immune response, persons with impaired cellular immunity, such as those with AIDS, may not develop the characteristic measles rash[.11](#page-4-10) These persons have a high case fatality and may develop a giant cell pneumonitis caused by measles virus.

Measles virus causes three rare but serious central nervous system complications: post-measles encephalomyelitis, sub-acute measles encephalitis, and sub-acute sclerosing panencephalitis (SSPE). Post-measles encephalomyelitis occurs in approximately 1 in 1000 cases, mainly in older children and adults. The syndrome develops within 2 weeks of the onset of rash and is characterized by fever, seizures, and a variety of neurologic abnormalities. Around 15% of patients die and half are left with severe sequelae. The finding of periventricular demyelination, the induction of immune responses to myelin basic protein, and the absence of measles virus in the brain suggest that it is an autoimmune disorder triggered by measles virus infection.

Sub-acute measles encephalitis (also known as *measles inclusion body encephalitis*) is a rare but fatal complication associated with progressive neurologic deterioration that affects individuals with defective cellular immunity and typically occurs 2 to 6 months after infection. There is lethargy, mental confusion, seizures, myoclonus, and diffuse cerebral dysfunction, which relentlessly progress to death in a few months. Pathologically, inflammatory changes are seen throughout the brain, and there are eosinophilic inclusions in the nuclei of neurons.

SSPE is a slowly progressive disease that affects approximately one per million of those who have had measles, occurring 5 to 15 years after the initial infection. It is characterized by seizures and progressive deterioration of cognitive and motor functions, followed by death within 2 years[.12](#page-4-11) SSPE most often occurs in persons infected with measles virus before the age of 2 years.

#### **PATIENT EVALUATION, DIAGNOSIS, AND DIFFERENTIAL DIAGNOSIS**

Health care workers should consider measles in patients with fever and generalized rash, particularly when measles virus is known to be circulating, or in individuals with a history of travel to endemic areas. Physical examination should focus on the clinical features of measles, specifically Koplik's spots and rash, as well as potential sites of secondary infections, including pneumonia and otitis media. Appropriate precautions need to be taken to prevent transmission within health care settings.

Measles is readily diagnosed on clinical grounds by clinicians familiar with the disease, particularly during outbreaks. Koplik's spots are especially helpful, as they appear before the rash and are pathognomonic (see [Fig. 32.1.3](#page-1-2)). Clinical diagnosis is more difficult in regions where the incidence of measles is low, as other pathogens are responsible for the majority of illnesses with fever and rash (Table [32.1.1\)](#page-3-1). The World Health Organization (WHO) clinical case definition for measles consists of any person with fever and maculopapular rash (i.e., non-vesicular) and cough, coryza, or conjunctivitis[.13](#page-4-12) Although this is not very specific, it is devised primarily for outbreak control and monitoring rather than clinical use.

The detection of measles virus–specific immunoglobulin M (IgM) in a single specimen of serum or oral fluid is considered diagnostic of acute infection and is the most common method of laboratory confirmation ([Fig. 32.1.6\)](#page-3-2).[14](#page-4-13) IgM antibodies may not be detectable until 4 days or more after rash onset and usually fall to undetectable levels within 4 to 8 weeks of rash onset. Alternatively, acute infection can be confirmed with a fourfold or greater increase in measles virus–specific immunoglobulin G (IgG) antibody levels between acute and convalescent sera. The presence of IgG antibodies in a single serum specimen is evidence of prior

infection or immunization, which cannot be distinguished serologically. Commercially available enzyme immunoassays for detecting IgM or IgG antibodies are the most frequently used diagnostic assays.

Measles also can be diagnosed by isolating measles virus in cell culture from respiratory secretions, nasopharyngeal and conjunctival swabs, blood, or urine. Detection of measles virus RNA by reverse transcriptase–polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) of clinical specimens can be accomplished using primers targeted to highly conserved regions of measles virus genes. When combined with nucleotide sequencing, these assays permit the precise identification and characterization of virus genotypes for molecular epidemiologic studies and can distinguish wild-type and vaccine measles virus strains.

The differential diagnosis of measles (see [Table 32.1.1\)](#page-3-1) includes other causes of fever, rash, and conjunctivitis, such as rubella, roseola, dengue, scarlet fever, infectious mononucleosis, and enterovirus or adenovirus infections. Less common causes include rickettsial infections (e.g., Rocky Mountain spotted fever), Kawasaki's disease, and drug reactions. Rubella, commonly mistaken for measles, is a milder illness without cough and with distinctive lymphadenopathy involving the posterior cervical, suboccipital, and posterior auricular nodes. The rash of roseola (exanthema subitum) appears after the fever has subsided. The atypical lymphocytosis in infectious mononucleosis contrasts with the leukopenia commonly observed in children with measles.

#### **PREVENTION AND TREATMENT**

The best means of preventing measles is active immunization with measles vaccine.[15](#page-4-14) Measles vaccines are live, attenuated viral vaccines that replicate within the host to induce protective immunity. The recommended age of first vaccination varies from 6 to 15 months and is a balance between the optimum age for seroconversion and the probability of acquiring measles before that age. The proportions of children who develop protective levels of antibody after measles vaccination are approximately 85% at 9 months of age and 95% at 12 months of age. As not all children develop protective immunity after vaccination, a second dose is recommended for all children as part of routine immunization. Supplementary doses of measles vaccine can be provided through mass vaccination campaigns (also called *supplemental immunization activities*) to rapidly achieve high levels of population immunity. An increasing number of countries are introducing rubella vaccine through the use of combined measles–rubella vaccine.

Evidence: randomized controlled trials.

The duration of vaccine-induced immunity is at least several decades, if not longer[.16](#page-4-16) Secondary vaccine failure rates have been estimated to be approximately 5% at 10 to 15 years after immunization but are probably lower when vaccination is given after 12 months of age. Decreasing antibody titers do not necessarily imply a complete loss of protective immunity, as a secondary immune response usually develops after re-exposure to measles virus, with a rapid rise in antibody titers without overt clinical disease.

Standard doses of currently licensed measles vaccines are safe in immunocompetent children and adults. Fever to 39.4°C (103°F) occurs in approximately 5% of seronegative vaccine recipients, and 2% of vaccine recipients develop a transient rash. Mild transient thrombocytopenia has been reported with an incidence of approximately 1 in 40,000 doses of the combined measles, mumps, and rubella (MMR) vaccine.

Measles vaccines are well tolerated and immunogenic in HIVinfected children and adults, although antibody levels may be lower than uninfected children when vaccination occurs in later infancy and antibody levels may wane faster. Because of the potential severity of wild-type measles virus infection in HIV-infected children, measles vaccination is recommended for routine administration to these children at 6 and 9 months of age, except those who are severely immunocompromised. An additional dose of measles vaccine should be administered after HIV-infected children achieve immune reconstitution after highly active antiretroviral therapy.

Other than general supportive measures, such as hydration and antipyretics, there is no specific antiviral therapy for persons with measles. Secondary bacterial infections are a major cause of morbidity and mortality after measles, and effective case management involves prompt treatment with antibiotics. Antibiotics are indicated for persons with measles who have clinical evidence of bacterial infection, including pneumonia and otitis media. *Streptococcus pneumoniae* and *Haemophilus influenzae* type b were common causes of bacterial pneumonia after measles, but vaccines against these pathogens likely lower the incidence of secondary bacterial infections after measles.

Vitamin A is effective for the treatment of measles and can result in marked reductions in morbidity and mortality ([Table](#page-4-17) [32.1.2](#page-4-17)). The WHO recommends administration of once-daily doses of 200,000 IU of vitamin A for 2 consecutive days to all children aged 12 months or older with measles. Lower doses are recommended for younger children: 100,000 IU per day for children aged 6 to 12 months and 50,000 IU per day for children younger than 6 months old. A third dose is recommended 2 to 4 weeks later in children with evidence of vitamin A deficiency[.17](#page-4-18)
