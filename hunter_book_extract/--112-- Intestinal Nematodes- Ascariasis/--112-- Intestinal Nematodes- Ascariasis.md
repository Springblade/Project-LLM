# **112** Intestinal Nematodes: Ascariasis

*Donald A. P. Bundy, Nilanthi de Silva, Laura J. Appleby, Simon J. Brooker*

#### KEY FEATURES

- • Ascariasis is the most prevalent human helminth infection and neglected tropical disease, with an estimated 819 million infections worldwide; it is also among the most common chronic infections of humans.
- • Morbidity and transmission are related to the worm burden, which has an over-dispersed distribution; most infected individuals have few worms, and a few individuals have many.
- • Most infections have insidious effects on growth and development, including cognitive development, but large worm burdens can result in intestinal obstruction, particularly in young children.
- • Intense infection is most common in school-age children, who are the targets for school-based community control efforts.
- • *Ascaris* is easy to treat with any one of several effective drugs in a single dose; see [Ref. 17](#page-4-0) for a systematic review.

#### **INTRODUCTION**

*Ascaris lumbricoides,* the largest of the intestinal nematodes, is also the most prevalent, with an estimated 819 million people infected worldwide[.1](#page-3-0) Female worms produce a prodigious number of eggs that are relatively resistant to drying and extremes of temperature. The adult worms usually inhabit the small intestine; passage of the larvae through the lungs is accompanied by pneumonitis, which is usually subclinical. Although a large burden of worms can cause fatal intestinal obstruction,[2](#page-3-1) infection is more frequently associated with morbidity and poor growth indicators. However, evidence of a link between *A. lumbricoides* infection and child growth is equivocal[,3–7](#page-3-2) due in part to the complexities in measuring parasiteassociated morbidity. Nevertheless, treatment is associated with demonstrable weight gain[.7](#page-3-3)

*Ascaris* (with *Trichuris* and hookworm) is one of the soiltransmitted helminth (STH) infection[s8](#page-3-4) that can be addressed through mass drug administration (MDA), benefitting from the availability of donated anti-helminthics as part of the London Declaration.[9](#page-3-5) In 2015 more than 500 million school-age children were treated through MDA programs, and in 2016 it is claimed that more than 300 million schoolchildren were treated in India alone.[10](#page-3-6)

#### **EPIDEMIOLOGY**

*A. lumbricoides* has no important animal reservoir, although the morphologically similar *A. suum* does occasionally infect humans, and *A. lumbricoides* may infect pigs.

The prevalence of infection varies geographically and is highest in warm and humid equatorial regions[.11](#page-3-7) Approximately 72% of all infections occur in Asia (especially in China, India, and Southeast Asia), 14% in sub-Saharan Africa, and 11% in Latin America and the Caribbean.[1](#page-3-0) There are small localized areas of high transmission. Cold, arid climates are free of infection; the current absence of infection in temperate areas is probably due to historical improvements in hygiene and sanitation. The distribution limits of *A. lumbricoides* are strongly related to land surface temperature and rainfall,[11](#page-3-7) with considerable local random spatial variation, due presumably to differences in personal hygiene, sanitation, and socioeconomic status. Infection is equally common in urban and rural settings.

Even in areas of high prevalence, the intensity of infection is not uniform. A small proportion of the population usually harbors the majority of worms, and this subset of heavily infected people is concentrated in children <10 years[.12](#page-3-8) Age-intensity profiles are typically convex, with maximum intensity at 5 to 10 years of age, and rapidly decline to a low level throughout adulthood. There is no difference by sex. Both individuals and families are predisposed to high or low intensity of infection; the size of the worm burden reacquired after successful treatment is positively associated with the intensity of infection before treatment[.12](#page-3-8) Factors that determine predisposition probably include differences in exposure and variations in individual susceptibility, some of which has been attributed to genetics.

## **NATURAL HISTORY, PATHOGENESIS, AND PATHOLOGY**

Adult females reside in the lumen of the distal small intestine and produce up to 200,000 eggs per day that are excreted in feces ([Fig. 112.1](#page-1-0)). In warm, moist, shaded soils, the embryo molts; the infectious second-stage larva within the egg can be ingested or possibly inhaled in contaminated dust. Larvae hatch in the jejunum, penetrate the intestinal wall, and migrate by way of hepatic venules to the right side of the heart and the pulmonary circulation, where they break into the alveolar spaces and undergo two further molts. From the alveoli, the 1.5-mm-long larvae ascend to the trachea, are swallowed, undergo a last molt in the intestine, and develop into adults. Larvae migrating through the lungs can induce pulmonary hypersensitivity in sensitized hosts, which can present as asthma. There can be eosinophilic inflammation and granulomatous reaction in the lungs, as well as hypersecretion of mucus, bronchiolar inflammation, and serous exudate.

The intestinal phase of infection is generally asymptomatic, but moderately heavy infections can affect the health, growth, and physical fitness of children. *Ascaris* produces disturbances in the absorption of several nutrients, including lactose, nitrogen, and vitamin A, each of which could contribute to growth faltering[.4,5](#page-3-9) The nutritional impact of infection depends on underlying host nutritional status and other factors, making quantifying the precise nutritional burden of ascariasis difficult[.6,7](#page-3-10) Heavy worm burdens can cause more serious complications; the most frequently reported, especially in children <10 years old, is obstruction of the terminal ileum by a bolus of worms ([Fig. 112.2](#page-1-1)).

It can take from 10 to 12 weeks from ingestion of eggs to the production of eggs. The number of adult worms per infected person can vary widely; egg production per female worm decreases as the worm burden increases, and thus egg counts may not linearly reflect intensity of infection. Adults live for approximately a year.

#### **Immune Response**

The human immune response in chronic helminth infection is associated with a strong localized T helper cell type 2 (Th2)

can reduce vaccine responses, and can alter immune responses to other pathogens[.16](#page-4-1)

## **CLINICAL FEATURES**

#### **Pulmonary Migration**

*Ascaris* larvae usually cause few symptoms along their migratory path, but in sensitized hosts, pulmonary manifestations can start within 1 week after ingestion of eggs. Symptoms are likely to occur where transmission is seasonal or sporadic (e.g., in Saudi Arabia). Other allergic manifestations to migrating larvae, such as urticaria, are more common at the end of the pulmonary phase. Fever, cough, wheezing, and dyspnea can be accompanied by sputum production, sometimes with small amounts of blood; chest pain and cyanosis are noted in the most severe cases. Chest film examination can show unilateral or bilateral abnormalities, ranging from nodular densities to diffuse interstitial patterns. Illness usually is limited to several weeks but can persist as larvae pass through the lungs. Leukocytosis and marked eosinophilia can occur, fulfilling the clinical picture of Löffler's syndrome. Rarely, severe pulmonary inflammation has progressed to death.

#### **Intestinal Infections**

The intestinal phase of infection is usually asymptomatic, but due to appetite loss and malabsorption of nutrients, even moderately heavy infections can affect the health, growth, and physical fitness of children.

Migration of adult worms can result in serious complications. Worms can reach the upper gastrointestinal (GI) tract and be vomited, or can be passed out per rectum. More frequently, migrating worms enter ducts or diverticula, where they can perforate or cause obstruction. The common bile duct is the most often

obstructed, leading to biliary colic or cholangitis. A worm that ascends higher in the biliary tree can result in liver abscess or can penetrate the bile duct and lead to bile peritonitis. When the pancreatic duct is obstructed, it can lead to pancreatitis. Appendicitis can be triggered by *Ascaris* obstructing the appendix [\(Fig. 112.3](#page-2-0)).

The most reported complication of heavy worm burdens, especially in children <10 years old, is partial or complete obstruction of the terminal ileum by a bolus of worms.[2](#page-3-1) These children have abdominal pain, vomiting, and occasionally, a palpable abdominal mass and perforation of the small intestine. Rarely, volvulus can occur. Ileocecal intussusception, as well as solitary intestinal perforation, has been attributed to *Ascaris,* but its causative role is not always clear.

## **PATIENT EVALUATION, DIAGNOSIS, AND DIFFERENTIAL DIAGNOSIS**

The diagnosis of ascariasis is usually made by a direct fecal smear in saline. Characteristic eggs (55–75 μm by 35–50 μm) can be seen in direct or concentrated stool specimens [\(Fig. 112.4](#page-2-1)). Unfertilized eggs can be more difficult to identify because of their atypical size and appearance. Decorticate eggs lacking the outer mamillated covering are sometimes produced, and these may be confused with the eggs of other nematodes; the thick hyaline shell is typical of *Ascaris.* The sensitivity of a fecal smear is influenced by the method used and intensity of infection. More sensitive polymerase chain reaction (PCR)–based diagnosis may be useful where available.[17](#page-4-0)

<span id="page-3-13"></span>Infections consisting of only male worms produce no eggs. On barium studies of the GI tract, worms can ingest barium and be seen as thin, curved linear densities [\(Fig. 112.5\)](#page-3-13). In cases of suspected biliary ascariasis or pancreatitis, duodenoscopy with retrograde cholangiopancreatography can establish a diagnosis and provide a non-surgical means of removing the worms. Ultrasonography is also useful in the diagnosis of biliary ascariasis but is of less value in pancreatitis.

#### **TREATMENT**

#### **Chemotherapy**

There are several well-tolerated and effective drugs for treatment of ascariasis, with cure rates of >90% commonly achieved[.18](#page-4-2) Side effects, if they occur, are transient and related to the GI tract.

Mebendazole (given as 100 mg twice daily for 3 days or as a single dose of 500 mg) and albendazole (as a single dose of 400 mg) are highly effective and are currently donated free of charge for use in school-based deworming programs. Treatment with benzimidazoles should not be administered during the first trimester of pregnancy or to infants under 12 months of age. Children aged 12 to 24 months can be treated under supervision with 500 mg mebendazole or 200 mg albendazole. Levamisole (2.5 mg/kg) is similarly efficacious but was withdrawn from the U.S. and Canadian markets in 2000 and 2003, respectively, because of reports of agranulocytosis. It nonetheless remains on the World Health Organization (WHO) Essential Medicines List and is still produced in some countries. Transient GI discomfort and headache have been reported with these drugs. Oxantel pamoate in combination with pyrantel is well tolerated and has demonstrated good efficacy against ascariasis[.19](#page-4-3) However, oxantel pamoate is marketed for human use only in South America and the Philippines, and is not currently registered with the U.S. Food and Drug Administration or the European Medicines Agency.

#### **Supportive Therapy**

Intestinal obstruction may necessitate surgery. However, patients who are clinically stable and well hydrated can often be managed conservatively with nasogastric suction, intravenous hydration, and anti-spasmodics followed by anti-helminthics given by nasogastric tube once the obstruction has subsided. In these cases, treatment is given after the obstruction is relieved to avoid paralyzing the worms in the ileum, which could precipitate complete obstruction. Obstruction of the bile or pancreatic ducts must be treated endoscopically or surgically, but conservative therapy may be appropriate in simple biliary colic.

#### **PREVENTION**

Without improvements in sanitation and hygiene, re-infection after treatment is common, especially as the eggs can remain viable in the environment for years. Chemotherapy targeted at school-age children delivered through schools is a feasible and effective approach to worm control, reducing morbidity and improving growth, especially weight[.20,21](#page-4-4) Repeated chemotherapy of this age group can also reduce transmission in the community, thus reducing worm burden and morbidity.
