# **<sup>131</sup> 131** Larval Cestode Infections (Cysticercosis)

*Hector H. Garcia, Robert H. Gilman*

#### KEY FEATURES

- • Neurocysticercosis (NCC) is the invasion of the human central nervous system (CNS) by larvae of the pork tapeworm *Taenia solium;* it is a major cause of seizures and other neurologic morbidity worldwide.
- • Parenchymal brain disease can follow a benign course and is usually associated with seizures.
- • Extraparenchymal (intraventricular or subarachnoid) disease is progressive, has a poor prognosis, and usually presents with hydrocephalus or intracranial hypertension.
- • Diagnosis of NCC is based on brain imaging computed tomography (CT) and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI)—and supported by specific serology (Western blot with purified antigens). Antigen detection assays may be of help in monitoring the course of disease.
- • Management should be individualized and includes symptomatic treatment (analgesics, anti-epileptic drugs, anti-inflammatory drugs) and anti-parasitic therapy with albendazole or praziquantel. The use of anti-parasitic therapy is of benefit in most cases, but there are specific contraindications.

#### **INTRODUCTION**

Cysticercosis is the infection of human tissues with larvae of the pork tapeworm, *Taenia solium.* Endemic in most of the world, this parasitic disease is a major cause of seizures and other neurologic morbidity.

#### **EPIDEMIOLOGY**

Neurocysticercosis (NCC) is estimated to be the most common parasitic infection of the brain and of adult-onset epilepsy worldwide. Cysticercosis is endemic on all continents except Australasia and is common in non-Muslim developing countries, including much of South and Central America, Asia, and Africa. Prevalence varies depending on the prevalence and type of animal husbandry, hygiene, and dietary practices. In endemic countries, approximately 30% of seizure disorders are caused by NCC.[1](#page-3-0) Industrialized porcine production, meat inspection, and sewage disposal have helped to prevent propagation of the parasite life cycle in highincome countries, but immigration from and travel to endemic regions lead to sporadic cases of cysticercosis. For example, cysticercosis accounts for as many as 2% of neurologic/neurosurgical admissions in Southern California, and immigrant tapeworm carriers (Latin American cooks) caused an outbreak of cysticercosis in orthodox Jews in New York City[.2](#page-3-1)

#### **NATURAL HISTORY, PATHOGENESIS, AND PATHOLOGY**

The natural history of cysticercosis is poorly defined because most infections are asymptomatic, and many of those who are symptomatic have a long pre-patent period. Symptomatic disease is serious, can be progressive, and can have fatal consequences. In general, numerous intracranial cysticerci are associated with more severe disease that is less likely to respond to treatment. The location of cysticerci is also important: patients with a few cysticerci with a parenchymal location and the absence of hydrocephalus have a better prognosis than those who have basal or ventricular lesions, especially if associated with hydrocephalus.

Cysticercosis is contracted when humans ingest material contaminated by human feces containing tapeworm eggs, not from eating infected pork containing cysticerci; this leads to gut infection with the tapeworm. When tapeworm eggs are ingested, humans act as the intermediate, dead-end host and develop cysticerci within their tissues in the same way as pigs [\(Fig. 131.1](#page-1-0)). Strict vegetarians and people who have never eaten pork can develop cysticercosis if they ingest fecally contaminated food items. Humans harboring an intestinal tapeworm can infect themselves (anus–hand–mouth) or others, either directly or through unhygienic food preparation. Internal autoinfection has been suggested but is unlikely; most persons with cysticercosis do not have an adult tapeworm at the time of diagnosis, and those only infected with a tapeworm do not develop cysticercosis.

Living cysticerci actively evade and suppress immune recognition, especially within immunologically privileged sites, such as the brain and the eyes. Histopathology of live cysts from human tissues shows minimal host inflammation. Only rarely do living cysticerci induce symptoms—usually by causing obstruction to the flow of cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) by pressure on adjacent tissues. Symptoms typically result from inflammation due to the host's immune response to dying cysticerci. This explains the usual delay between infection and cyst establishment (which occurs within 3 months of infection) and the development of symptoms several years later. English soldiers returning from India and remaining in the UK, a non-endemic area, developed seizures caused by cysticercosis after a median of 3 to 5 years[.3](#page-3-2)

Inflammation around the cysticerci can be asymptomatic or lead to acute symptoms that can be fatal. Lymphocytes and plasma cells usually outnumber giant multinuclear cells and macrophages. Eosinophils are conspicuous. Adjacent necrosis and perivascular infiltration of mononuclear lymphoid cells can lead to granuloma, fibrous scar, or calcification. In the same patient, cysticerci at different sites may be viable or at various stages of degeneration.

In the central nervous system (CNS), two major forms of cysticerci are found. Cysticerci in the brain parenchyma or floating freely in the ventricles are spherical or ovoid, 5- to 10-mm structures, each of which contains a scolex (see [Fig. 131.1\)](#page-1-0). A second, uncommon form are large, lobulated, vesicular structures (racemose cysticercosis) that lack a scolex and are usually found in the basal cisternal spaces resembling a bunch of grapes. This is usually not seen in pediatric cases. They may be a late degenerative form and/or a response to a different anatomic location.

#### **CLINICAL MANIFESTATIONS**

Although cysticerci can infect any tissue, most clinically relevant lesions affect the brain and spinal cord (NCC) or the eye [\(Fig.](#page-1-1) [131.2A](#page-1-1)). Clinical features of cysticercosis vary depending on the number, size, and location of the larvae, as well as on the stage of evolution and inflammatory response.

### **Neurocysticercosis**

The two major clinical forms of NCC are intraparenchymal (within the brain hemispheres or cerebellum) or extraparenchymal (intraventricular or subarachnoid lesions).

The most frequent symptom of intraparenchymal cysticercosis is seizures; focal seizures with secondary generalization are most common, but any type can occur. Single or multiple cysticerci within the brain parenchyma can be inflamed and surrounded by focal encephalitis and edema.

Extraparenchymal NCC is associated with increased intracranial pressure (ICP) with or without hydrocephalus. When the subarachnoid space at the base of the brain is affected, basal arachnoiditis can be severe, causing cranial nerve palsies and potentially fatal raised ICP. Intraventricular or basal cysticercosis is a frequent cause of obstructive hydrocephalus in endemic regions. Intermittent, positional headache may represent a free-floating cysticerci in the fourth ventricle (Brun's syndrome). Meningeal inflammation around subarachnoid cysts can cause vasculitis and cerebral infarcts, usually when the base of the brain is affected[.4](#page-3-3)

The encephalitic form occurs predominantly in children and young females and consists of massive infection of the brain (see [Fig. 131.1\)](#page-1-0). Lesions are in the same phase of development and cause an immune reaction leading to severe brain edema. These patients have intracranial hypertension, seizures that are difficult to control, and a reduced level of consciousness. Rare clinical forms include dementia or other psychiatric symptoms (often in association with hydrocephalus) or chronic meningitis.

Spinal cysticercosis, although uncommon, is associated with increased pressure either directly from the cysticercus or secondary to the inflammatory reaction. Spinal cysticercosis is more frequently subarachnoid and only rarely intramedullary. Cervical spinal cysticercosis is usually associated with racemose cysticercosis of the posterior fossa.

#### **Ophthalmic Cysticercosis**

Cysticerci infecting the eye are most frequently retinal or subretinal, but they may also float freely in the vitreous or aqueous humors (see [Fig. 131.2A\)](#page-1-1). Light entering the eye during ophthalmoscopy can induce movement and even evagination of a living parasite. Inflammation around degenerating cysticerci usually threatens vision by causing chorioretinitis, retinal detachment, or vasculitis.

#### **Muscular and Subcutaneous Cysticercosis**

Some patients have characteristic subcutaneous cysticerci palpable as pea-like nodules. These are usually asymptomatic, although transient local pain and tenderness can occur as cysticerci degenerate. The frequency of subcutaneous nodules varies considerably by geographic area, with <5% of patients in South America and >20% of patients in Asia having subcutaneous nodules. These lesions are easy to biopsy and provide proof of disease.

Large numbers of cysticerci can infect muscles, and rare cases of massive muscular pseudohypertrophy have been reported (see [Fig. 131.2B\)](#page-1-1). These patients can also have many cysticerci in multiple other localizations.

#### **PATIENT EVALUATION, DIAGNOSIS, AND DIFFERENTIAL DIAGNOSIS**

NCC should be suspected in patients presenting with neurologic symptoms and a history of living in or traveling in endemic regions, particularly if they have late-onset seizures or raised ICP. Given the variability of clinical manifestations, the diagnosis is based on neuroimaging findings and supported by serology. The American

<span id="page-2-0"></span>Society of Tropical Medicine and Hygiene and the Infectious Diseases Society of America have published consensus guidelines on the management of patients with NCC.[5](#page-3-4)

## **History of Taeniasis**

Patients should be asked whether they have passed tapeworm segments, even decades previously, and stools should be examined for tapeworm eggs to rule out infection. Younger individuals or those with many viable brain parasites have a higher risk of concurrent taeniasis; overall it is found in 10% of NCC patients. The finding of *Taenia* spp. eggs does not differentiate intestinal *T. saginata* from *T. solium,* as eggs are morphologically identical. Examination of expelled worm scolexes or proglottids may allow definitive identification of the species [\(Fig. 131.3](#page-2-0)), although polymerase chain reaction should be more accurate. A tapeworm coproantigen detection enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) has much better sensitivity, although it is not widely available.[6,7](#page-3-5)

#### **Imaging**

CNS imaging using either computed tomography (CT) or magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) is the key tool for the diagnosis of NCC. Living cysticerci are visible as 5 to 10-mm hypodense lesions that do not enhance with intravenous contrast ([Fig. 131.4](#page-2-1)). Degenerating cysticerci, which are more likely to be associated with symptoms, are surrounded by edema with ring or nodular contrast enhancement. End-stage calcified cysticerci are seen as hyperdense lesions. MRI provides more detailed images of living and degenerating cysticerci [\(Fig. 131.4\)](#page-2-1). MRI frequently demonstrates cysticerci that may not be seen on CT, especially small lesions or those located in the posterior fossa. MRI is better than CT in defining edema and inflammation but is less sensitive in detecting calcifications. Plain radiographs of the thighs or other muscles may reveal calcifications formed by degenerated cysticerci (see [Fig. 131.2B\)](#page-1-1).

#### **Serology and Cerebrospinal Fluid Examination**

The enzyme-linked immunoelectrotransfer blot (EITB, Western blot) using lentil-lectin purified glycoprotein antigens (LLGP) of *T. solium* is the assay of choice to detect infection-specific antibodies in serum or CSF. It has superseded less sensitive ELISAs and has >98% sensitivity and specificity, although it has only 60% to 80% sensitivity for a single ring-enhancing lesion. It has equal sensitivity in serum or CSF, so a lumbar puncture is not required. In patients

<span id="page-2-1"></span>from endemic areas, some healthy urban populations and >10% of rural villagers in pig-raising areas can be seropositive.[8](#page-3-6) Patients with clinical symptoms tend to have more specific bands than those who are asymptomatic, and patients with strong reactions to several bands have more intracranial lesions.

CSF findings may be normal and, even when abnormal, there are no characteristic features. Moderate CSF pleocytosis and elevated protein concentration can be noted; eosinophils are found in approximately one-quarter of patients. Antigen detection ELISA assays have only moderate sensitivity in intraparenchymal NCC but can be useful for follow-up of patients with extraparenchymal disease.[9,10](#page-3-7)

#### **Biopsy**

If subcutaneous cysticerci are found, excision or biopsy of them can confirm the diagnosis. The gross biopsy specimen is a white, fluid-filled, semi-opaque bladder typically 5 to 10 mm in diameter, but rarely up to 70 mm. The bladder contains a solid, 2-mm-long larval tapeworm scolex. Microscopic examination reveals four suckers and a double row of hooks on the scolex.

#### **Differential Diagnosis**

Clinical features of cysticercosis are heterogeneous, but imaging and reliable serology facilitate the diagnosis. A single ring-enhancing intracranial lesion presents a difficult differential diagnosis because 20% to 40% of patients with these lesions can have a negative EITB. Other possible causes are tuberculosis (more common), neoplasm, or brain abscess caused by bacteria, fungi, or *Toxoplasma gondii.* Differentiating a tuberculoma from a cysticercal granuloma can be difficult, often necessitating empiric therapy for tuberculosis[.11](#page-4-0) Cystic images other than cysticercosis can be subarachnoid or porencephalic cysts, hydatid cysts, and cystic astrocytomas. Intracranial calcifications can be caused by tuberculosis, toxoplasmosis, tuberous sclerosis, and cytomegalovirus. Subcutaneous cysticerci can be mistaken for subcutaneous lipomas.

#### **TREATMENT**

Treatment of neurocysticercosis involves symptomatic and anti-parasitic therapies. Symptomatic treatment is a key part of management. It includes analgesics, anti-convulsants, antiinflammatories (mostly steroids), and management of intracranial hypertension, if present. Anti-convulsants should be given as for any other cause of epilepsy. Raised ICP, with or without arachnoiditis, usually responds to oral corticosteroids; steroids may be required long term with persistent intracranial inflammation. Insertion of a ventriculoperitoneal shunt for hydrocephalus can be beneficial in the short term, but shunt blockage is common when the CSF protein concentration is elevated. Corticosteroids in patients with ventriculoperitoneal shunts have improved the prognosis.

Anti-parasitic treatment of cysticercosis involves killing living brain parasites by using albendazole (15 mg/kg/day in two doses orally for 8–15 days) or praziquantel (50–75 mg/kg/day in three doses orally for 15 days). Treatment of patients with viable or degenerating cysts with anti-parasitic therapy correlates with better seizure evolution[.4,12,13](#page-3-3)

Albendazole is currently the drug of choice because of slightly greater efficacy, better availability, and lower cost. A short course of 75 to 100 mg/kg of praziquantel divided in three doses in the same day (every 2 hours) is efficacious in patients with one or two cysts. Combined albendazole plus praziquantel increases the anti-parasitic effectiveness with multiple parenchymal cysts[.14](#page-4-1)

Between the second and the fifth days of anti-cysticercal therapy, patients usually have an exacerbation of neurologic symptoms attributed to local inflammation with death of the larvae. Therefore albendazole or praziquantel should be given in hospital, usually with corticosteroids to control edema and intracranial hypertension. Although co-administration of corticosteroids reduces the blood levels of praziquantel, this is not clinically relevant.

#### **Perilesional Edema Around Calcified Cysticerci**

In approximately 50% of patients with seizures associated only with calcified lesions (no viable parasites), an area of pericalcification edema appears on MRI taken a few days after a seizure. This resolves spontaneously in the following weeks and should not be interpreted as representing survival of parasites, but most likely represents an inflammatory reaction around parasite debris and/ or edema associated with seizure activity[.15,16](#page-4-2)

#### **Pediatric Cysticercosis**

Pediatric cases are usually found in older children or young teenagers with recent-onset seizures and a single degenerating cyst. Rarely, massive infections present with headache and intracranial hypertension. Diagnostic and therapeutic considerations are similar to those for adults.

#### **Asymptomatic Neurocysticercosis**

Asymptomatic viable cysticerci may be identified by imaging studies of the brain performed for other reasons. If the cysticerci are not causing symptoms and not associated with evidence of inflammation, the parasites are assumed to be alive and evading immune-mediated inflammation. There are no data on the benefits of anti-parasitic treatment in these cases; cestocidal treatment would kill the parasites. However, these cysticerci often resolve without symptoms; thus an alternative choice is not to treat but to advise patients to seek medical help if neurologic symptoms develop.

#### **Ophthalmic Cysticercosis**

The inflammation associated with a degenerating intraocular cysticercus can result in permanent loss of vision. Ocular cysticercosis is usually treated surgically. Excision of a living cysticercus before the onset of intraocular inflammation has a good prognosis. Reports of successful treatment with cestocidal drugs, cryotherapy, and photocoagulation await confirmatory studies.

### **Muscular and Subcutaneous Cysticercosis**

Asymptomatic subcutaneous or intramuscular cysticerci do not require treatment, but imaging studies should be performed to preclude the presence of neurologic infection. Cysticerci causing symptoms through local pressure can be excised or treated with cestocidal drugs. Corticosteroid or non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs control transient symptomatic inflammation around degenerating cysticerci.

#### **PREVENTION AND CONTROL**

Transmission of cysticercosis depends on the presence of tapeworm carriers. Human infection with tapeworms is prevented by freezing or cooking of infected (measly) pork. In contrast, human cysticercosis results from fecal–oral contamination with material containing *T. solium* eggs, and basic hygiene and sanitation prevent this[.17](#page-4-3)

*T. solium* is in a very short list of potentially eradicable diseases, and recent evidence of focal elimination of transmission after an intervention program in a wide region of northern Peru supports this view[.18](#page-4-4)
