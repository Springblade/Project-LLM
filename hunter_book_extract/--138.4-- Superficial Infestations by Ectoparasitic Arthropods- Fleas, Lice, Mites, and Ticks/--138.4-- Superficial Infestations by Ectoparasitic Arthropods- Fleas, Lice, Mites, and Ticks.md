# **138.4** Superficial Infestations by Ectoparasitic Arthropods: Fleas, Lice, Mites, and Ticks

*David A. Warrell*

Some blood-feeding invertebrates infest the skin and hair of human bodies and clothing for long periods. Tropical climate, poverty, and lack of personal hygiene increase the risk of acquiring and harboring ectoparasites from other humans, animals, or the environment. These infestations are irritating, distressing, embarrassing, and anti-social, but it is only during the past century that Westerners have rejected being flea-ridden and lousy. Biting and burrowing are painful, irritating, and may lead to hypersensitivity, secondary local infection, or systemic infectious diseases acquired from the arthropod vectors.

### **SPECIFIC INFECTIONS TRANSMITTED BY INFESTING ARTHROPODS**

- • Fleas: rickettsioses, *Bartonella henselae,* and plague.
- • Ticks: viral encephalitides; viral hemorrhagic fevers; Colorado, Oklahoma, and Kemerovo tick fevers; louping ill; spirochetoses; rickettsioses; bartonellosis; ehrlichiosis; anaplasmosis; and protozoal infections (babesiosis).
- • Lice: spirochetoses and rickettsioses.
- • Trombiculid mites: scrub typhus, Hantaan virus.
- • Scabies mites: encourage local secondary streptococcal skin infections leading to acute glomerulonephritis.
- • Bed bugs: *Bartonella quintana, Trypanosoma cruzi.*

#### **FLEAS (INSECTA, FAMILY PULICIDAE)**

Humans can be infested and bitten by human (*Pulex irritans*), dog, cat, rat, pigeon, and other animal fleas. Tropical rodent fleas (*Xenopsylla* species) transmit plague and murine typhus. Flea bites cause small groups of intensely itchy bites, appearing as red macules with a central puncta, often in a line a few centimeters apart, especially on the trunk or buttocks. Fleas may not remain on the body after feeding, but retreat to bedding or crevices and cracks in the bed or room. Examination of underclothing or quickly turning back the sheets may reveal jumping fleas.

#### **TREATMENT**

Itching bites are treated with counter-irritants, topical corticosteroid, or systemic antihistamines (see Chapter 138.2). Domestic animals and the infested environment should be kept as clean as is practicable and treated with pyrethroid or other pesticides.

## **LICE (INSECTA, FAMILY PEDICULIDAE)[1](#page-2-0)**

Human head lice, body (clothing) lice, and pubic lice are obligate human parasitic insects that spread through close physical contact. Nymphs and adults require blood for survival and feed daily.

#### **Head Lice (***Pediculus capitis***)**

Head lice flourish on the human scalp, even in hygienic, affluent conditions (e.g., in English teenage schoolgirls). Eggs ("nits") stuck to head hairs are recovered using a fine comb. Itching and scratching may cause secondary infection with occipital lymphadenopathy.

#### Treatment

Repeated application of insecticide lotion (pyrethroid, organophosphate, or carbamate) and combing.

#### Prevention

Avoid head-to-head contact and sharing of combs and hair adornments.

#### **Body Lice (***Pediculus humanus***)**

Body lice infestation is promoted by poor hygiene (unwashed clothes and bodies) and crowding. Such conditions are common accompaniments of disasters, wars, forced immigration, and cold wet seasons (e.g., highlands of Ethiopia). Lice and their eggs may be discovered on skin, body hair, or in clothing, especially in the seams. More than 21,500 lice have been found in one person's clothing. Individual bites look like flea bites but lack their linearity. There is only mild local irritation.

#### Treatment

Clothing is burned or heat-sterilized and impregnated with pyrethroids. Infested people are bathed with soap and 1% Lysol.

#### **Pubic (Crab) Lice (***Pthirus pubis,* **Family Phthiridae)**

Pubic lice cause sexually transmitted infestation of the pubic hair, body hair, eyebrows, and eyelashes, where they provoke itching, scratching, secondary infection, and a curious bluish staining (maculae caeruliae). Eggs are stuck to the hairs.

#### Treatment

Insecticides (see earlier) are applied to affected areas, left on for 1 to 2 days, and then re-applied after a week. Sexual contacts should also be treated.

#### **MITES (ARACHNIDA)**

### **Scabies Mites (Acari, Family Sarcoptidae)[1-3](#page-2-0)**

The human scabies (itch) mite *Sarcoptes scabiei* var. *hominis* causes chronic skin infestation. Scabies mites adapted to other mammalian hosts, such as *S. scabiei* var. *canis,* causing sarcoptic mange in dogs, produce only self-limiting pruritus in humans. Avian mites *Dermanyssus gallinae* and *Ornithonyssus* spp. occasionally bite humans, causing scabies-like lesions. Only the 3-mm-long adult females of *S. scabiei* causes symptoms by burrowing through the epidermis within the stratum granulosum and depositing 2 to 3 eggs daily during their month-long life. Six-legged larvae hatch in a few days, migrate to the skin surface, and molt to become eight-legged nymphs and later adults, maturing in about 10 to 14 days. The smaller males die after mating on the epidermis and do not burrow. Females feed on cells of the stratum corneum and its secretions. Mite excretions, saliva, and eggs provoke a type IV delayed hypersensitivity reaction in the host, responsible for the notorious irritation and itching, which begins up to 3 weeks after initial infestation, but soon after with re-infestation. In an immunocompetent host, a typical infestation involves fewer than 20 mites.

#### Epidemiology

Worldwide prevalence rates vary between 0.2% to 71.4% and is highest in children. An estimated 100 million people are infested. Prevalence increases with overcrowding or social disruption, as in wartime. Outbreaks occur in nursing homes and hospitals. Scabies is usually transmitted by close physical contact often involving whole families, rather than fomites, as the mites do not survive long away from the body.

#### Clinical Features

Burrows most commonly occur in the interdigital clefts between the fingers and on the wrists but may be more widespread on the trunk in the elderly [\(Fig. 138.4.1](#page-1-0)). Tracks are serpiginous, extending for a few millimeters up to 1 centimeter, creating linear papulovesicular, rarely bullous, lesions with excoriation, secondary infection, eczematization, lichenification, and erythematous papules. Lesions are intensely itchy, especially at night and after a hot bath or shower, provoking scratching and excoriation that promotes secondary infection. In about 7% of cases, very itchy reddish-brown nodules occur on the genitalia, groin, buttocks, and axillae (nodular scabies). In infants, vesicular, pustular, and nodular lesions are found on the axillae, head, face, diaper region, palms, and soles. An exuberantly crusting form, Norwegian scabies, occurs in patients immunosuppressed by HIV, by human T-lymphotropic virus (HTLV)-1, or by drugs employed in organ transplantation, and in people with trisomy 21. Demarcated, hyperkeratotic, scaly plaques involve, in particular, the extremities, scalp, face, neck, and buttocks. The scales contain thousands of mites, and the load per patient may exceed 1 million mites. This type of scabies is very infectious, and a single case can give rise to nosocomial and institutional outbreaks.

#### Complications

In developing countries, scabetic lesions often become secondarily infected with *Staphylococcus aureus* and *Streptococcus pyogenes.* Strains

of the latter organism may cause rheumatic fever, rheumatic heart disease, and post-streptococcal glomerulonephritis.

#### Diagnosis

This is confirmed by microscopy of scrapings from affected areas, especially interdigital spaces, but many cases are atypical and a dermatologic opinion may be required to exclude other causes[.4](#page-2-1) Newer non-invasive techniques include videodermatoscopy, dermatoscopy, reflectance confocal microscopy, and optical coherence tomography.

#### Treatment

Topical 5% permethrin cream, crotamiton 1% cream, and ivermectin 1% lotion applied to the whole body surface of all affected people and close contacts are all effective single-dose treatments, achieving clinical cure in 2 to 4 weeks.[5,6](#page-2-2) Resistance to permethrin results in treatment failure. Oral single-dose ivermectin (0.15–0.2 mg/kg) is equally effective. Topical benzyl benzoate, malathion, and sulfur compounds are less effective. Topical lindane is effective but is deemed unsafe. All these treatments can be repeated after 1 to 2 weeks if necessary. Itching may persist and requires topical counter-irritants, a corticosteroid (e.g., crotamiton and hydrocortisone), and a sedating H1 antihistamine (chlorphenamine) at night. Nodular scabies may require additional corticosteroid treatment. Patients cured of scabies may be left with persistent post-scabies eczematous rashes.

Norwegian scabies can be treated with oral ivermectin (200 µg/ kg, in multiple doses), which has proved effective when combined with topical treatment and keratolytics.

#### Prevention

Clinical recognition and prompt treatment of entire families or communities will reduce prevalence. Single-dose oral ivermectin proved superior to topical permethrin for treating scabies and preventing scabies and secondary impetigo in island populations with endemic scabies. Successful combined mass treatment campaigns against scabies and intestinal helminths have been carried out, scabies vaccines are being developed, and elimination of human scabies is envisaged by some optimists.

#### **Trombiculid (Harvest) Mites (Acarani,** *Leptotrombidium* **spp., Family Trombiculidae)**

Sometimes known misleadingly as "chiggers," trombiculid mites can infest humans in large numbers, especially under tight underpants, causing multiple, persisting, painful, itchy, blistering bites. They occur particularly in grassy, rodent-infested "mite islands" in jungle clearings throughout Asia and the Pacific region, where they are responsible for transmitting scrub typhus.

#### Prevention

Use diethyl-toluamide (DEET)–containing repellents, tuck trousers into boots, and avoid entering, and especially lying down in, notorious "mite islands"—cleared areas of jungle that are densely infested with these trombiculids.

#### **Bedbugs (Insecta,** *Cimex* **spp., Family Cimicidae)[7](#page-2-3)**

The common bedbug, *Cimex lectularius,* is cosmopolitan and, in recent years, infestations have increased in developed countries, such as the UK. In tropical countries, it is replaced by *C. hemipterus.* In tropical West Africa and South America, the bat bedbug *Leptocimex boueti* may also infest humans. There is no convincing

<span id="page-2-5"></span>evidence that bedbugs transmit infections such as hepatitis B, but they are competent vectors of *Bartonella quintana* and *Trypanosoma cruzi* to mammals. Adults reach a length of about 5 mm. Nymphs pass through five instars to reach adulthood after about 4 months. Nymphs and adults take about 5 to 10 minutes to obtain a full blood meal. Adults may take several blood meals over several weeks but can survive 6 months' starvation.

At night, bedbugs emerge from cracks and crevices in the bedroom to bite sleeping humans. Sometimes, bites go unnoticed, but bedbugs may cause sleeplessness through pain and allergic reactions to their bites. Lines or clusters of erythematous or urticarial papules and even disseminated bullous eruptions may appear, and contact clothes are spotted with blood. Rooms that are heavily infested may acquire an unpleasant odor. Bites are discouraged by keeping the light on all night, by sleeping under a permethrin-impregnated mosquito net, and by putting newspaper beneath the under-sheet. Eradication is by thorough cleaning of the environment (heavily infested furniture may have to be burned), steam-cleaning sheets or exposing them to the sun, and application of residual insecticides. However, insecticide resistance has developed, and bedbugs are becoming more abundant.

## **TICKS (ACARI[\)8–10](#page-2-4)**

Soft (argasid) ticks (family Argasidae) live in animal burrows and human dwellings. They attach briefly at night, engorge rapidly with blood, and then drop off and hide in cracks and crevices. Ticks of the genus *Ornithodorus* transmit relapsing fevers (*Borrelia* spp.).

Hard (ixodid) ticks (family Ixodidae) or their tiny nymphs may be picked up from vegetation or brought into gardens by deer or indoors by dogs. They find a secluded area (groin, perineum, waist, umbilicus, axilla, scalp, and even external auditory meatus) and feed for days until they are spherical and engorged. The bite of hard ticks is not usually detected during feeding. Multiple bites may cause local vesicular lesions [\(Fig. 138.4.2\)](#page-2-5). Some species transmit Lyme disease, Rocky Mountain spotted fever, African tick fevers, European tick-borne encephalitis, Crimean-Congo hemorrhagic fever, Colorado tick fever, louping ill, babesiosis, ehrlichiosis, anaplasmosis, tick-borne relapsing fevers, and other human infections. Some species, especially in North America and Australia, can inject a paralyzing neurotoxin (see later).

#### **Prevention of Tick-Transmitted Infections**

• Common sites for tick attachment should be examined when undressing at night after being in the field.

- <span id="page-2-6"></span>• Domestic animals should be treated for tick infestation or contact with them avoided.
- • Light-colored trousers allow ticks to be seen more easily.
- • Trouser bottoms should be tucked into boots.
- • DEET-containing repellents should be applied.
- • Specific antibiotic chemoprophylaxis against tick-transmitted pathogens is not justified.

To remove the tick, grasp it as close as possible to the skin surface using fine curved (iris) forceps. Avoid squeezing the tick's engorged body. The tick should be pulled out gently without twisting ([Figs. 138.4.3A and B\)](#page-2-6). If the barbed hypostome mouth part breaks off, it should be removed separately, as it may provoke inflammation and granuloma formation. Preserve the tick for later expert identification in case symptoms develop.
