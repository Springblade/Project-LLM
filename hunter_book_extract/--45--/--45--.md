#### **INTRODUCTION**

The presence of spiral, gram-negative bacteria on the human gastric mucosa was recognized in the late 19th century and related to peptic ulcer disease and gastric cancer. In 1983 Warren and Marshall were the first to successfully culture *Helicobacter pylori* from gastric biopsy samples. Through self-ingestion, they confirmed that this bacterium caused gastro-duodenal disorders[.1](#page-3-0) Today, *H. pylori* is known to be the main cause of chronic gastritis, peptic ulcer disease, gastric carcinoma, and gastric mucosa-associated lymphoid tissue (MALT) lymphoma, and has been declared by the World Health Organization (WHO), as a class I carcinogen. It is estimated that more than half of the world's population is colonized with *H. pylori,* with the vast majority becoming infected in childhood.

#### **EPIDEMIOLOGY**

*H. pylori* is one of the world's most common bacterial infections, if not the most common ([Fig. 45.1](#page-1-0)). The bacterium is present in human populations throughout the world, and phylogeographic studies indicate that humans have been colonized by *H. pylori* since their ancestral migration from east Africa more than 50,000 years ago. There are substantial differences in its prevalence, both within and between countries.[2](#page-3-1) In industrialized countries, the overall prevalence of *H. pylori* generally varies between 30% and 40% and increases with age. This is related to an age-cohort effect with decreasing infection rates in subsequent generations because of improved hygiene and housing conditions. In developing countries, however, *H. pylori* prevalence rises rapidly during the first 5 years of life, often to 80% or more, and then remains constant thereafter. This indicates that *H. pylori* is mostly acquired early in childhood[.3](#page-3-2) Once acquired, colonization persists throughout life in the absence of antibiotic therapy. The infection rate is thus inversely related with socio-economic development and is a direct reflection of living conditions during childhood. In Western countries, prevalence remains considerably higher among first- and second-generation immigrants[.2,4](#page-3-1)

*H. pylori* has a narrow host range and is almost exclusively found in humans. The exact mechanisms whereby *H. pylori* is acquired are largely unknown. New infections are thought to occur as a consequence of direct human-to-human transmission, either via the oral–oral or fecal–oral route, or both.[1](#page-3-0)

# **NATURAL HISTORY, PATHOGENESIS, AND PATHOLOGY**

*H. pylori* is a spiral, gram-negative bacterium with flagella. It is microaerophilic, requiring low levels of oxygen. Although its natural habitat is the acidic gastric lumen and it can resist brief exposure to pH levels below 4, growth only occurs at a pH between 5.5 and 8.0. Intra-gastric survival occurs within the protective mucus layer, with local acid buffering by the high bacterial urease activity. The associated gastritis also impairs acid production and thus enhances bacterial survival[.1](#page-3-0)

## **Pathogenesis**

*H. pylori* colonization induces chronic active gastritis in virtually all infected subjects. Colonization is accompanied by a persistent immune response, but this is ineffective in clearing the bacterium. Only a minority of colonized subjects develop overt disease, in particular, peptic ulcer disease and gastric cancer. The risk of disease development in the presence of *H. pylori* is related to a combination of factors, including bacterial strain differences, host susceptibility, and environmental factors. *H. pylori* exhibits a high level of genetic diversity that translates into major differences in virulence. Two main virulence factors are the *cagA* and *vacA* genes. The *cagA* pathogenicity island is present in some 40% to 60% of strains, and is strongly associated with the development of peptic ulcers, as well as gastric cancer. The *vacA* gene is present in all strains, but has polymorphisms that translate into differences of expression. Host susceptibility is influenced by genetic polymorphisms in various cytokine genes that affect the level and profile of the inflammatory response to colonization with *H. pylori*. Furthermore, environmental factors play a role in *H. pylori*–related pathogenesis. Smoking increases the risk of ulcers, and diets high in salt and low in antioxidants and vitamin C increase cancer risk.

Finally, the pattern of *H. pylori* colonization also determines disease risk. Subjects with normal-to-high acid output have an antral-predominant gastritis and are most at risk for duodenal ulceration. Subjects with low acid output demonstrate pan-gastritis and are most at risk for gastric ulceration and cancer.[1,6](#page-3-0)

#### **CLINICAL FEATURES**

*H. pylori* infection is associated with chronic gastritis, peptic ulcer disease, distal gastric adenocarcinoma, gastric MALT lymphoma, and Ménétrier's disease (pre-malignant hypertrophic gastropathy).

(From Hooi JKY, Lai WY, Ng WK, et al: Global prevalence of *Helicobacter pylori* infection: systematic review and meta-analysis. Gastroenterology 2017;153:420–9.)

#### **Gastritis**

Colonization with *H. pylori* in the first weeks can be associated with acute gastritis, which can be accompanied by transient, non-specific dyspepsia symptoms, such as fullness, nausea, and vomiting. The majority of subjects do not clear the infection, despite the humoral and cellular response. They continue to develop persistent colonization with chronic active gastritis. 

|

#### **Peptic Ulcer Disease**

It is estimated that approximately 20% of *H. pylori*—positive subjects develop peptic ulcer disease during their lifetime, and those with an ulcer have a more than 50% risk for recurrent ulcer disease in the years thereafter. This strong association exists for both duodenal ulcers and gastric ulcers. <sup>1,7</sup> Ulcers may be associated with intestinal bleeding and perforation and, in some cases, stricture formation. Eradication of *H. pylori* prevents recurrence of ulcers and their complications in most patients, unless they have a second risk factor for ulceration, in particular, use of non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) or aspirin.

#### **Gastric Cancer**

*H. pylori* infection is the starting point in a cancer-associated cascade that passes through the stages of chronic gastritis, atrophic gastritis, intestinal metaplasia, and dysplasia to cancer. *H. pylori* may initiate this process by causing chronic cellular proliferation, increasing the likelihood of mutagenic processes in the presence of carcinogenic substances. Although development of the initial stages of this progressive cascade (in particular, atrophic gastritis and intestinal metaplasia) are common in *H. pylori*—positive individuals, only 1% to 2% of *H. pylori*—infected patients eventually develop gastric carcinoma as a result of lifelong infection. <sup>6-10</sup>

#### **Mucosa-Associated Lymphoid Tissue Lymphoma**

Healthy gastric mucosa normally does not contain lymphoid follicles, but lymphocytes are inevitably present in the gastric mucosa in all *H. pylori*—positive individuals. In rare cases, this eventually leads to the development of MALT B-cell lymphomas

(usually low grade). Close to 100% of patients with low-grade gastric MALT lymphoma have evidence of *H. pylori* infection. *H. pylori* eradication is the primary treatment for these patients, as it leads to either partial or complete regression in more than 70% of patients.<sup>7,10</sup>

#### Ménétrier's Disease

Ménétrier's disease, also called *hypertrophic gastropathy*, is a rare condition of unknown etiology. However, a majority have evidence of *H. pylori* infection; successful eradication can lead to major improvement of symptoms and should therefore always be considered.<sup>7,10</sup>

#### Gastroesophageal Reflux Disease

Although *H. pylori* has been clearly demonstrated as a cause of the earlier-mentioned diseases, discussion remains as to whether it also carries potential beneficial effects. This discussion, in particular, focuses on the negative association between *H. pylori* colonization and the development of gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD) and its sequelae, including esophageal cancer.<sup>7,10,11</sup>

#### H. pylori Infection in Children

*H. pylori* infection in children may be associated with recurrent abdominal pain, iron deficiency, and, during conditions of nutritional limitation, growth retardation; however, the incidence of peptic ulcer disease is lower than in adults. In contrast, reports suggest that *H. pylori* protects children from developing asthma and atopy.<sup>3,7,10</sup>

# PATIENT EVALUATION, DIAGNOSIS, AND DIFFERENTIAL DIAGNOSIS

H. pylori can be diagnosed by various methods, each with advantages and disadvantages. Non-invasive testing is recommended for primary screening of young individuals and children who present with upper abdominal complaints. These tests are based on the detection of H. pylori enzyme activity, antigen, or antibodies. Invasive testing is usually reserved for patients undergoing diagnostic or therapeutic upper intestinal endoscopy as part of a

broader evaluation, and involves sampling of mucosal tissue for evaluation of the presence of *H. pylori* through direct detection of measuring enzyme activity. As *H. pylori* may not be evenly spread throughout the stomach in infected individuals, multiple biopsy samples from various locations are required for optimal sensitivity[.10,12](#page-3-6)

# **Noninvasive Tests**

#### Urea Breath Tests

Urea breath tests (UBTs) are based on the large urease production by all *H. pylori* strains. UBTs are very reliable, low-burden tests that have been validated both in adults and children. Fasting patients consume a small amount of either 14C- or 13C-labeled urea. Urease degrades urea, releasing labeled carbon dioxide that enters the bloodstream via the gastric mucosa and can be detected in a breath sample.[13,14](#page-4-0)

#### Serology

Serum antibodies (especially IgG) against *H. pylori* can easily be detected. The main disadvantage of serology is that antibodies can still be detected for a considerable period after eradication of *H. pylori.* Furthermore, as the antigenic properties of *H. pylori* strains vary between countries, the tests should be locally standardized[.13,14](#page-4-0)

## Fecal Antigen Testing

*H. pylori*–specific antigens can be detected in diluted stool samples. This is an attractive test for use in small children, as obtaining breath samples can be difficult and serum sampling can be burdensome[.13,14](#page-4-0)

#### Urine Antigen Testing

Anti–*H. pylori* antibodies can be detected in urine samples as well. Currently this is not a generally applied method; however, recent data seem promising for this easily applicable, non-invasive method.[13,14](#page-4-0)

# **Invasive Tests**

# Culture

In reference microbiologic laboratories, culturing of gastric biopsy specimens for 3 to 7 days at 37°C under micro-aerophilic conditions can be performed, enabling detection of *H. pylori* and determination of antimicrobial resistance[.14](#page-4-1)

#### Histology

*H. pylori* can be identified by hematoxylin-eosin staining and histopathologic examination of gastric biopsy specimens. When performed by an experienced pathologist, it is highly reliable and often considered the gold standard for diagnosing *H. pylori.* Special stains enhance detection, but are not necessary[.14](#page-4-1)

#### Rapid Urease Test

Probably the most widely used invasive test is the rapid urease test, which is based on bacterial urease (also known as a *CLO test* [*Campylobacter*-like organism test]). A gastric biopsy sample is placed in media with a pH-color indicator. Urea degradation is accompanied by a pH increase that is detected by a color change of an indicator. It is an easy and low-cost test, but also has the lowest sensitivity and specificity of the invasive assays.[14](#page-4-1)

## **TREATMENT**

#### **Indications**

Indications for treatment are still evolving ([Table 45.1](#page-2-0)). Consensus exists for the treatment of individuals with *H. pylori*–associated peptic ulcer disease and gastric MALT lymphoma. Treatment of individuals with non-ulcer dyspepsia is more controversial. Most authorities would treat *H. pylori*–infected individuals thought to be at increased risk of gastric carcinoma, including those with a family history of gastric cancer and those with gastric dysplasia. Individuals with Ménétrier's disease and *H. pylori* should be treated.[10](#page-3-6)

# **Antimicrobials**

In vitro, *H. pylori* is susceptible to most antimicrobials, but in vivo only a few antimicrobials can be used to cure infected patients. This is related to limited drug levels within the gastric mucus layer. Metronidazole, clarithromycin, amoxicillin, and tetracycline are the most widely used antimicrobial drugs used to treat individuals with *H. pylori* infection. None of the earlier-mentioned antibiotics is effective enough to eliminate *H. pylori* when given as monotherapy. Successful eradication of *H. pylori* requires a combination of drugs, consisting of two antibiotics in combination with an acid-suppressive drug. Current guidelines for the treatment of *H. pylori* are given in [Table 45.2](#page-3-7).

In general practice, 20% to 30% of the treatment regimens fail, usually because of insufficient patient compliance or the increasing presence of antibiotic resistance (Fig. [45.2](#page-3-8)). Patients who fail treatment are usually re-treated with another antimicrobial combination ([Table 45.2\)](#page-3-7).[10,12,15](#page-3-6)

## **Prevention**

Increasing antibiotic resistance among *H. pylori* is occurring worldwide. Research efforts are focusing on the development of an effective
