*Christopher L. King*

# KEY FEATURES

- • Filariasis is a mosquito-transmitted nematode infection; the burden of infection correlates with exposure to infected mosquitoes.
- • There is widespread chronic filariasis in 52 countries, with 856 million people at risk and an estimated 100 million infected.
- • Adult parasites (up to 10 cm in length) live in the host lymphatics for many years and can lead to lymphatic dysfunction.
- • Clinical disease ranges from acute filarial lymphangitis (AFL) and acute dermatolymphangioadenitis (ADLA) to intermittent or chronic lymphedema in the extremities and/or hydroceles in men that can be painful, disabling, and cause social stigma. Most infected persons are asymptomatic.
- • Risk of infection is very low in travelers who are in endemic countries for less than a year.
- • Individuals first exposed or infected with lymphatic filariasis as adults are more likely to have clinical disease and eosinophilia.
- • Medication can kill the parasites but cannot reverse the advanced disease. However, basic approaches for lymphedema management can reduce filarial fevers and lead to significant improvement of lymphedema.
- • Lymphatic filariasis is targeted for elimination in many endemic areas in one of the largest mass drug treatment programs ever attempted for an infectious disease. This program, using donated drugs, eliminates infection, interrupts transmission, and prevents disease.

#### **INTRODUCTION**

Lymphatic filariasis (LF) is caused by infection with three species of parasites: *Wuchereria bancrofti, Brugia malayi,* and *B. timori.* The mosquito-transmitted infection occurs throughout the tropics but is highly heterogeneous in its distribution, infecting a high proportion of people in some communities and few in others[.1](#page-6-0) Parasites can persist for years in humans and, consequently, the burden of disease occurs in adults.

The nematodes live in human lymphatics resulting in lymphatic damage and dysfunction that leads to recurrent swelling and disfigurement of the limbs (elephantiasis), genitalia (hydroceles) in men, and sometimes breasts in women. Occasionally, infected individuals develop a retrograde lymphadenitis and lymphangitis. The disfigurement resulting from LF can have substantial economic and psychosocial consequences, particularly among individuals whose livelihoods depend on physical labor.

Descriptions of elephantiasis are found in early Indian, Egyptian, and Persian writings, and epidemiologic association of elephantiasis with hydrocele, chylocele, and chyluria were established by the middle of the 19th century. Their common etiology, however, remained a mystery until discoveries were made of microfilariae in hydrocele fluid (Demarquay, 1863), chylous urine (Wucherer, 1868), and blood (Lewis, 1872), and of the adult worm in a lymphatic abscess (Bancroft, 1877). Patrick Manson first described uptake of microfilariae by *Culex* sp. mosquitoes and their maturation to infective forms (1875–1889). This was the first description of the mosquito as a vector for any parasitic disease and paved the way to his discovery of malaria transmission. Manson also made the association between endemic microfilaremia with elephantiasis and other lymphatic diseases.

#### **EPIDEMIOLOGY**

Currently, an estimated 856 million people are living in endemic areas in 52 countries, with 100 million people infected. More than 90% of infections are caused by *W. bancrofti* for which humans are the only natural host.

LF is endemic and a major public health problem in Africa, Asia, the Indian subcontinent, the western Pacific Islands, focal areas of Latin America, and the Caribbean—particularly Haiti and the Dominican Republic ([Fig. 114.1](#page-1-0)). Approximately 65% of those at risk reside in south and Southeast Asia, 30% in sub-Saharan Africa, and the remainder in other parts of the tropical world[.2](#page-6-1) In the Americas, endemic foci persist on the island of Hispaniola and in coastal areas of Guyana and northeastern Brazil. Infection with *B. malayi* is limited to Asia (India, Malaysia) and several western Pacific island groups (Indonesia and the Philippines). There are fewer than 10 to 20 million persons in these areas that are infected with *B. malayi.* Unlike *W. bancrofti, B. malayi* has feline and primate reservoirs. *B. timori* is only found on the islands of southeastern Indonesia. LF used to be endemic in North America and Australia in the early 20th century. China, Japan, and the Republic of Korea were considered endemic until fairly recently[.2](#page-6-1) Sri Lanka, Egypt, Togo, Cambodia, and several small island countries in the South Pacific have declared LF elimination as a public health priority; small pockets of transmission may persist. In contrast to the success of LF elimination in rural areas, increasing urbanization and associated poor sanitation provide breeding sites for vectors and transmission of LF that have been difficult to control.[3](#page-6-2)

The distribution of LF is highly focal. This is as a result of the different feeding and breeding behaviors of the mosquito vectors. For example, *W. bancrofti* is transmitted in much of rural Africa by *Anopheles* species, whereas in many urban areas, including India and in the Western Hemisphere, *W. bancrofti* is transmitted by *Culex* mosquitoes.[4](#page-6-3) Other vectors are *Aedes* species in some Pacific islands and *Mansonia,* which transmits *B. malayi.* LF may be inefficiently transmitted and therefore uncommonly infects travelers with short-term exposure.[5](#page-6-4)

Microfilariae of *W. bancrofti* and *B. malayi* have a nocturnal periodicity. A few microfilaria appear in the circulation around 6 PM, but the majority are in the peripheral circulation between 10 PM and 2 AM, coinciding with the time when most mosquito vectors take their blood meal.[6,7](#page-6-5) In contrast, there is no clear-cut periodic cycle for *Aedes*-transmitted microfilariae in the South Pacific.

Infection, detected by microfilaria in the blood and circulating filarial antigens released by adult worms, is gradually acquired until the third or fourth decade of life ([Fig. 114.2\)](#page-1-1). In areas of intense transmission, initial infection commonly occurs between the ages of 2 and 4 years; the prevalence of microfilaremia increases rapidly between the ages of 5 and 10 years [\(Fig. 114.3](#page-2-0)). The presence of circulating antigen is about twice as sensitive than microfilariae for detecting infection[.8](#page-6-6)

Chronic manifestations, such as lymphedema and hydrocele (in males), occur infrequently in those younger than 10 years and increase with age[8](#page-6-6) (see [Fig. 114.3](#page-2-0)). The role of gender in susceptibility to infection and disease is poorly understood. Hydrocele is the most common clinical manifestation of *W. bancrofti,* whereas chronic lymphedema has been more common in women. Occupation and socioeconomic status are important risk factors, as filariasis affects primarily persons of the lowest socioeconomic levels. Host genetics may be important in susceptibility and development of LF, but more research is needed.

# **NATURAL HISTORY, PATHOGENESIS, AND PATHOLOGY**

*W. bancrofti, B. malayi,* and *B. timori* have five morphologically distinct stages to their life cycle [\(Figs. 114.2](#page-1-1) and [114.4\)](#page-2-1). Adult female worms release up to 10,000 first-stage larvae or microfilariae per day, which circulate in blood. Microfilariae are approximately 250 µm long and 10 µm wide and have an acellular sheath. Microfilariae of *W. bancrofti* and *B. malayi* differ morphologically based on the pattern of nuclei in the caudal and cephalic regions. Microfilariae are most abundant in the circulation at night (nocturnal periodicity) and sequester in the deep vascular beds during the day. This periodicity is thought to prolong the survival

<span id="page-2-1"></span>of microfilariae (≈9 months) and result in high levels of microfilaria in some individuals (e.g., >10,000/mL).

Microfilariae are ingested by mosquitoes and exsheath after the blood meal, penetrate the mosquito gut wall, and migrate to the mosquito's thoracic muscle where they grow and undergo two molts to infective third-stage larvae (L3) in 10 to 14 days. L3 larvae migrate to the mouthparts of the mosquitoes where they are deposited in the dermis during feeding. The L3 actively enter the feeding site, migrate to the local lymphatics where they quickly molt to L4-stage larvae, and then migrate centrally in the lymphatic systems to develop into sexually mature, adult worms at 6 to 9 months. Adult worms are long, threadlike organisms—hence the name filariae; female worms range from 40 to 100 mm in length and males from 20 to 40 mm (Fig. 114.4). A striking feature of adult worms is their ability to cause massive dilation of the surrounding and proximal lymphatics, indicating release and/or stimulation of potent lymphangiogenic factors. This leads to lymphatic valvular dysfunction and the inability to remove interstitial fluid and lymphedema. Death of adult worms and associated inflammation (acute filarial lymphangitis) can accelerate the process of lymphatic dysfunction. Although treatment can reverse some of the dysfunction, there is often persisting damage, putting an individual at risk for bacterial super-infections. The type and extent of overt clinical disease are related to where adult worms accumulate. Large numbers of adults appear to accumulate in

lymphatics draining the lower extremities (inguinal and obturator lymphatics); in the axillary nodes in the upper extremities; and, for *W. bancrofti* in men, in the lymphatics draining the spermatic cord, epididymis, and tunica vaginalis surrounding the testis.

An important characteristic of *W. bancrofti* and *Brugia* species is the presence of an obligate intracellular bacterial endosymbiont, *Wolbachia. Wolbachia* support essential biochemical pathways necessary for parasite survival, especially for embryogenesis and molting that are critical for transition from one parasite stage to another.<sup>9</sup>

#### **CLINICAL FEATURES**

LF varies from subclinical infection to chronic manifestations. The three species of parasite cause similar signs and symptoms, although urogenital disease and chyluria do not occur with *Brugia* infection.

#### **Subclinical Infection**

Most infected persons are asymptomatic, despite circulating microfilariae or filarial antigen in the peripheral blood. <sup>10</sup> Although they are asymptomatic, infected individuals have underlying lymphatic damage. <sup>11,12</sup> Microscopic hematuria or proteinuria are also found in infected persons. <sup>13</sup>

#### **Acute Manifestations**

Infected persons can exhibit acute manifestations, particularly acute filarial lymphangitis (AFL) and acute dermatolymphangioadenitis (ADLA). AFL is acute inflammation of a lymphatic vessel that progresses distally along the vessel and is thought to be caused by the death of the adult worm.[14,15](#page-6-11) Patients give a history of pain, erythema, and tenderness in the affected lymph node region for hours or a day before the onset of lymphangitis. Localized inflammatory nodules in the breast, scrotum, or subcutaneous tissues have been reported.

ADLA is caused by bacterial infection of the small collecting lymphatic vessels in areas of lymphatic dysfunction[.16](#page-6-12) Unlike true filarial lymphangitis, this syndrome develops in a reticular rather than a linear pattern and is associated with severe pain, fever, and chills. There is often a history of injury to the skin, such as trauma, insect bites, or interdigital fungal infections. ADLA is often diagnosed as cellulitis, and symptoms can last 3 to 15 days.

The adenolymphangitis of brugian filariasis (both *B. malayi* and *B. timori*) is distinct, dramatic, and destructive. In brugian filariasis, a single local abscess can form along the lymphatic tract, most often in the inguinal area, but sometimes in the axillae. These can suppurate and form sterile abscesses that can leak lymph before healing with a scar ([Fig. 114.5](#page-3-0)).

#### **Chronic Manifestations**

It is estimated that of the 85 to 100 million persons infected worldwide, approximately one-third, or 25 to 30 million, have clinically overt disease, 15 to 20 million with hydrocele and 5 to 10 million with lymphedema or elephantiasis.

#### *Genital Manifestations*

In many endemic areas, the most common chronic manifestation of LF caused by *W. bancrofti* is hydrocele. Other forms of genital disease are epididymitis, orchitis, funiculitis, lymphedema of the scrotum, and vulvar lymphedem[a17,18](#page-6-13) [\(Fig. 114.6\)](#page-3-1). The pathogenesis of filarial hydrocele is thought to be a result of lymphatic damage caused by living adult *W. bancrofti.* In filariasis-endemic areas, hydrocele may actually be chylocele, from rupture of dilated intrascrotal lymphatic vessels and leakage of lymph into the cavity of the testicular tunica vaginalis[.19](#page-6-14) Hydroceles can become large (over 30 cm in diameter) with enlarged inguinal lymph nodes.

**Fig. 114.5** Clean-based ulcer resulting from the rupture of a filarial abscess. (Courtesy Dr. David Dennis.)

Men with lymphedema of the scrotum can have rupture of dilated lymphatic vessels in the scrotal wall and ooze lymph to the exterior. Genital manifestations of LF occur only with *W. bancrofti* infection.

#### *Lymphedema and Elephantiasis*

Lymphedema occurs in the legs, scrotum, penis, breast, and arms ([Fig. 114.7](#page-4-0)). It is more common in the lower extremities, with asymmetric involvement. In bancroftian filariasis, lymphedema can involve the entire limb, whereas in brugian filariasis, the swelling is restricted to the distal extremities below the knee or elbow.

Grading systems describe the severity of lymphedema and consist of four World Health Organization (WHO) classification grades:

Grade I: pitting edema that is reversible upon elevation of the extremity

Grade II: non-pitting edema that is not reversible upon elevation of the extremity

Grade III: non-pitting edema that is not reversible with elevation and is associated with thickened skin or skin folds

Grade IV: non-pitting edema with fibrotic and papillomatous skin lesions and the presence of skin folds (elephantiasis) (see [Fig. 114.7](#page-4-0))

Another grading (staging) system has been proposed that contains seven categories and provides a more refined description of lymphedema stage based on depth of skin folds and types of papillomatous lesions[.21](#page-6-16)

Reversible episodes of lymphedema of the extremities progress to elephantiasis over a period of years. Factors involved include repeated attacks of ADLA[,19](#page-6-14) the intensity of filarial transmission within a population[,22](#page-6-17) and the presence of *Wolbachia.*[9](#page-6-7)

With *Brugia,* insidious onset of chronic lymphedema or elephantiasis is less common than in bancroftian filariasis. Sclerotic, cordlike lymphatics and enlarged firm nodes of the arms and legs are usual.

#### <span id="page-4-0"></span>*Chyluria*

Chyluria, resulting from rupture of dilated retroperitoneal lymphatic structures into the renal pelvis, is a rare but serious manifestation of LF. As a result of loss of chyle, which contains dietary lipids, proteins, and vitamins, weight loss and malnutrition can ensue. The condition is painless. The frequency of chyluria in filariasis is not known, but it is lower than lymphedema or hydrocele.

#### **Tropical Pulmonary Eosinophilia**

Tropical pulmonary eosinophilia (TPE) results from *W. bancrofti* or *B. malayi* infection[.23,24](#page-6-18) Most cases have been reported in longterm residents in India, although there are cases from Pakistan, Sri Lanka, Brazil, Guyana, and Southeast Asia. Men aged 20 to 40 years old are most commonly affected, with a male/female ratio of 4:1. The pathogenesis of TPE results from an exaggerated allergic hypersensitivity response to microfilariae as they migrate through the pulmonary blood vessels. TPE is characterized by a paroxysmal, non-productive cough (more severe at night), wheezing, low-grade fever, adenopathy, generalized malaise and weight loss, with eosinophilia (>3000 cells/mm3 ), elevated serum IgE (>10,000 ng/mL), and elevated anti-filarial antibody titers. Peripheral microfilaremia is usually absent in TPE. Chest radiographs can be normal or show diffuse small (1–3 mm in diameter) interstitial or reticulonodular infiltrates with increased bronchovascular markings. Pulmonary function tests show restrictive and occasionally obstructive abnormalities. Treatment with diethylcarbamazine (DEC) provides symptomatic improvement with decreases in eosinophilia and serum IgE. In advanced, untreated cases, disease can progress to chronic restrictive lung disease with diffuse interstitial fibrosis.

#### **Lymphatic Filariasis in Expatriates and Travelers**

AFL has been well documented in travelers to endemic areas. Two to six months after exposure, acute inflammation develops in a lymphatic vessel and its associated lymph nodes, most frequently in the leg, scrotal area, or arm. Characteristically, the inflammation progresses distally along the lymphatic vessel, which becomes indurated, tender, and erythematous, and resolves spontaneously within 3 to 7 days. Because biopsies reveal intense inflammation and non-living adult worms, AFL is thought to be caused by the death of the adult worm[.25](#page-6-19) The risk of developing chronic manifestations of LF for the traveler is very low, as the parasite is inefficiently transmitted to humans by infected mosquitoes[.5](#page-6-4)

# **PATIENT EVALUATION, DIAGNOSIS, AND DIFFERENTIAL DIAGNOSIS**

#### **Patient Evaluation**

Diagnosis of LF relies on the epidemiologic history, clinical findings, and laboratory tests. Acquisition of filarial infection requires prolonged exposure, usually longer than 3 months. Most infected individuals are asymptomatic; however, a clinical diagnosis can be made in those with acute episodic adenolymphangitis, hydrocele, or irreversible lymphedema. Eosinophilia is inconsistent in individuals with long-standing exposure and infection. In children, filarial lymphadenopathy is seen commonly[.5,8](#page-6-4) Adult worms can be detected by ultrasonography of the inguinal, crural, and axillary lymph nodes and in vessels of infected children[.12](#page-6-20)

#### **Diagnosis**

A definitive diagnosis requires detection of the parasite, parasite antigen, or parasite DNA. The standard is detection of microfilariae on a thick blood film stained with Giemsa or hematoxylin (see [Fig.](#page-2-1) [114.4\)](#page-2-1). A rapid diagnosis can be made by adding 100 µL of fingerprick blood to a tube with 900 µL of 3% acetic acid. Microfilariae can be counted using low-power magnification[.26](#page-6-21) This is useful for rapid diagnosis where only one species of filaria is present.

A stained slide distinguishes different filarial parasites. Sampling must account for the periodicity of microfilaria. Microfilaria of *W. bancrofti* circulate at highest concentration at night; therefore blood specimens should be collected between 10 PM and 2 AM. Microfilaria can be found in blood, hydrocele fluid, and occasionally in other fluids, such as urine.

Detection of circulating filarial antigen (CFA) is now the most widely used method for detection of *W. bancrofti* infections using whole blood, plasma, or serum. Adult filarial worms release a circulating antigen that can be detected by a commercially available rapid-format immunchromatographic test strip.[27](#page-6-22) The test is semi-quantitative, more sensitive than detection of microfilariae, and can be performed on blood samples at any time. The levels of CFA correlate with intensity of infection. After treatment, individuals may clear their microfilariae but remain CFA positive, although levels decrease. The test is specific for *W. bancrofti,* except among individuals co-infected with a heavy burden of *Loa loa.*[28](#page-6-23) There are currently no tests for circulating antigens in brugian filariasis.

Antibody-based assays have poor specificity and cannot distinguish among the filaria. An improved assay detects anti-filarial IgG4, which cross-reacts less with non-filarial helminths.[29](#page-6-24) Elevated anti-filarial IgG4 levels indicate active infection. Species-specific recombinant antigens have also been developed for brugian and bancroftian filariasis.[30](#page-6-25) A rapid dipstick can identify *B. malayi* based on BmR1 antigen[31,32](#page-6-26) and is sensitive for only *Brugia.* Antibody assays cannot distinguish between active and prior infections.

Antigen- or antibody-based assays are the best way for diagnosis of travelers; they are simple to perform and sensitive, and most laboratories outside of filarial-endemic areas do not have experience detecting microfilariae. Moreover, most filarial-infected individuals are amicrofilaremic. The antigen-based assays, however, are currently not licensed in the United States and other developed countries.

Polymerase chain reaction–based assays to detect *W. bancrofti* and *B. malayi* in blood are currently research based.[33](#page-6-27) They have been used to detect filaria in mosquitoes as part of monitoring transmission referred to as *xenomonitoring*.

Adult worms in lymphatic vessels or nodes can be found in pathologic specimens[.36,37](#page-7-0) Examination of superficial lymphatics of the extremities and female breast, or the intrascrotal lymphatics in men, using ultrasound in conjunction with Doppler has demonstrated motile adult worms, termed the *filaria dance sign*. [37–39](#page-7-1) Filarial worms have been visualized in intrascrotal lymphatics in up to 85% of infected men. Radionuclide lymphoscintigraphic imaging of the extremities has demonstrated lymphatic dilatation and dysfunction in asymptomatic persons and those with lymphedema[.11,40](#page-6-9)

#### **Differential Diagnosis**

Bacterial infection, thrombophlebitis, or trauma can be mistaken for acute filarial adenolymphangitis; however, filarial lymphangitis is retrograde, helping to differentiate it from bacterial lymphangitis. Tuberculosis, leprosy, sarcoidosis, and other systemic granulomatous diseases can be confused with filarial disease. Chronic lymphedema can be caused by malignancy, post-operative changes, congenital malformations, or a hereditary form of lymphostasis (Milroy's disease), as well as by renal or cardiac failure. Physical examination is not sufficient to distinguish these causes. A foreign-body reaction to silica dust introduced into traumatized legs, termed *podoconiosis,* accounts for elephantiasis in some parts of the world.

Patients with filarial lymphedema are often amicrofilaremic, so that diagnosis depends on the epidemiologic and clinical history, as well as the physical examination, and can be supported by positive serology. In orchitis and epididymitis, sexually transmitted infections must be considered. For tropical pulmonary eosinophilia, a failure to respond to DEC treatment should suggest an alternative diagnosis.

# **TREATMENT**

Single-dose combination regimens have replaced traditional 12-day courses of DEC (6 mg/kg per day for 12 days for a total dose of 72 mg/kg). Single doses of DEC (6 mg/kg), ivermectin (200 µg/

kg), and albendazole (400 mg) provide a sustained reduction in microfilarial levels up to 3 years[,41](#page-7-2) as well as a >70% reduction in circulating antigen levels. The WHO adopted this regimen for mass drug administration (MDA) outside sub-Saharan Africa[.42](#page-7-3) Although there are no official recommendations for using this combination, it is reasonable to treat individuals with this regimen at 6-month intervals until they are amicrofilaremic and circulating antigen negative [\(Table 114.1](#page-5-0)).

Adverse events (AEs) are common, particularly in those with parasitemia, after DEC and/or ivermectin treatment. AEs can start as early as a few hours after and generally peak 24 to 36 hours after treatment[.41](#page-7-2) Systemic AEs are fever, headache, malaise, joint and body pain, dizziness, and nausea. Their frequency and severity are positively correlated with microfilarial counts and result from the rapid killing of microfilariae. Localized AEs related to dying adult worms are much less common and typically occur later after treatment; they include lymphangioadenitis with nodules containing dying worms and transient lymphedema. Males can complain of scrotal pain. To reduce the risk of side effects, an escalating dose of DEC or ivermectin can be used. Alternatively, individuals can be pre-treated with 1 to 3 days of oral steroids or managed with anti-inflammatory drugs.

DEC has been used to treat filarial infections since the 1940s. It is active against microfilaria and does not completely kill adult worms but may permanently sterilize them. DEC results in sequestration of microfilariae and their eventual destruction by the immune system; it is dependent on inducible nitric oxide synthase and cyclooxygenase. Before treatment, it is important to exclude co-infections with onchocerciasis and loiasis. Co-infections are most common in west and central Africa and not in Asia or the Pacific regions. Treatment with DEC can cause rapid death of *Onchocerciasis volvulus* microfilaria in the skin (or eye), resulting in severe skin and eye reactions; with high levels of circulating *L. loa* microfilaria, severe systemic reactions and even death can occur.

Ivermectin is highly active against microfilaria and contributes to sterilization of adult worms but does not kill them. It acts by hyperpolarization of glutamate-sensitive channels and blocks the contractile activity of the excretory/secretory vesicle.[43](#page-7-4) As a result, molecules that modulate the immune response are not released, leaving microfilaria susceptible to host killing near release from adult worms. There are fewer AEs in subjects co-infected with onchocerciasis, as ivermectin is used to treat onchocerciasis. Ivermectin is not recommend for those co-infected with *L. loa,* especially those with high microfilarial counts.[44](#page-7-5) Ivermectin is also effective against scabies, *Strongyloides,* and *Ascaris* and has some activity against hookworm and *Trichuris.* After single-dose ivermectin used for MDA of onchocerciasis, the proportion of mosquitoes with infectious malaria sporozoites was reduced[;45](#page-7-6) however, this effect is transient and is unlikely to affect transmission of malaria.

Albendazole (single 400-mg dose) has no activity on microfilaria but some activity against adult worms that produces a slow decline in microfilariae over months. Biannual treatment over 3 years can almost completely clear microfilariae[;46](#page-7-7) it can be safely used in onchocerciasis and loiasis co-infection. Albendazole inhibits the polymerization of worm β-tubulin and microtubule formation. A

<span id="page-5-0"></span>**TABLE 114.1** Effect of Commonly Used Antifilarial Drugs on Microfilariae and Adult Worms

| Drug               | Microfilariae | Adult |
|--------------------|---------------|-------|
| Diethylcarbamazine | ++            | +     |
| Ivermectin         | ++            | −     |
| Albendazole        | −             | +     |
| Doxycycline        | −             | ++    |

single dose (400 mg) partially decreases *W. bancrofti* microfilaremia for 6 to 12 months, and when used in combination with DEC (or ivermectin), the number of microfilaria is reduced for a longer length of time than after a single dose of DEC.

*Wolbachia* are essential for *W. bancrofti* and *Brugia* spp. Therefore treatment with an 8-week course of doxycycline (200 mg daily) leads to long-term sterility and eventual death of >90% of adult worms[.47](#page-7-8) This slow death of worms is an advantage, as it has fewer side effects compared with more rapidly acting drugs like DEC. Shorter courses of doxycycline do not kill most adult worms; one study showed that 3 weeks of doxycycline followed by a single dose of DEC (6 mg/kg) had similar efficacy to ≥4 weeks of doxycycline.[48,49](#page-7-9) Anti-*Wolbachia* therapy improves lymphatic pathology and decreases severity of lymphoedema and hydrocele.[50](#page-7-10) Doxycycline is contraindicated in children <9 years of age and in pregnant or breastfeeding women. Therefore a 4-week course of doxycycline could be considered in the appropriate patient.

# **PREVENTION AND CONTROL**

Travelers and short-term residents should use bed nets and mosquito repellants for prevention of *W. bancrofti* and *Brugia* spp. Transmission is inefficient, and infections require many months, or years, to acquire.

In 2000, the global program to eliminate lymphatic filariasis (GPELF) by 2020 was launched. The goal of GPELF is to break the cycle of disease transmission between mosquitoes and humans, mainly through MDA using one of three regimens: (1) ivermectin/ DEC/albendazole in endemic countries where onchocerciasis and loiasis are not co-endemic; (2) ivermectin/albendazole in Africa where onchocerciasis is co-endemic; or (3) albendazole alone in Africa where loiasis is co-endemic. MDA is intended to reduce the microfilaria reservoir below a level required to sustain transmission by mosquitoes. Because single-dose regimens fail to sterilize or kill all adult filarial worms and do not reduce the community microfilaria reservoir to sufficiently low levels, four to six rounds of MDA are required to interrupt transmission. This approach has successfully eliminated LF in some countries. The new triple-drug regimens that have sustained reduction in microfilaria should shorten the number of annual rounds of treatment required to interrupt transmission. The GPELF program is one of the most ambitious programs ever attempted to eliminate a major parasitic infection. It has distributed more than 6 billion doses of drugs in more than 65 endemic countries. Bed nets used as part of malaria control will also have a substantial impact on transmission of LF; the two infections are often co-endemic and can share the same vectors[.51](#page-7-11)
