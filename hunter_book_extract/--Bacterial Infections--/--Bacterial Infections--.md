#### KEY FEATURES

- • Trachoma is the leading infectious cause of blindness worldwide.
- • It is caused by serotypes A–C of *Chlamydia trachomatis,* an intracellular obligate human bacterium.
- • Active trachoma is largely found in children who develop follicles and papillary inflammation of the tarsal conjunctiva, seen when the upper lid is everted.
- • These children are at risk of developing scarring of the conjunctiva with in-turning of the eyelashes (trachomatous trichiasis), which rub against the surface of the globe leading to corneal scarring and blindness.
- • Trachomatous trichiasis affects adolescents and adults and has significant socio-economic impact in endemic regions.
- • The World Health Organization (WHO) recommends the SAFE strategy for trachoma control: surgery, antibiotics, facial cleanliness, and environmental improvements.
- • Implementation of the SAFE strategy and improvements in living standards have led to reductions in the levels of trachoma, but there is still significant work to do to achieve the goal of eliminating blinding disease by 2020.
- • Inclusion conjunctivitis is caused by *C. trachomatis,* serotypes D–K, a gram-negative, intracellular bacterium, which is the most common bacterial sexually transmitted infection worldwide.
- • Adult inclusion conjunctivitis (AIC) is caused by inoculation of infected genital secretions into the eye. Neonatal inclusion conjunctivitis (NIC) is caused by inoculation from the infected mother's genital tract during birth. Ophthalmic infection in children after the neonatal period may indicate child sexual abuse.
- • Serious ocular complications are uncommon. However, it is important to treat potential associated systemic disease. In women, there is a risk of pelvic inflammatory disease, ectopic pregnancy, and infertility from concomitant genital chlamydial infection. Examination and treatment of sexual contacts are important. Neonates with chlamydial conjunctivitis may have associated disease, including chlamydial pneumonia, which requires treatment.
- • Treatment of adult inclusion conjunctivitis is with a single dose of oral azithromycin. Alternatively, doxycycline 100 mg twice a day for 7 days (oral) is used. Treatment of neonatal chlamydial conjunctivitis is with a 14-day course of oral erythromycin, although oral azithromycin has been shown to be effective.

#### **TRACHOMA**

#### **Introduction**

Trachoma is the leading infectious cause of blindness worldwide and is caused by recurrent episodes of infection with *Chlamydia trachomatis.* The Alliance for the Global Elimination of Blinding Trachoma by the year 2020 (GET 2020) was established by the World Health Organization (WHO) in 1997 and has helped to coordinate trachoma control efforts. The recent Global Trachoma Mapping Project has established where current control efforts need to be concentrated[.1](#page-6-0)

#### **Epidemiology**

Blinding trachoma is endemic in at least 20 countries, largely in poor and remote areas across Africa, Asia, Latin America, the Middle East, and the Pacific Rim[.2,3](#page-6-1) In 2016 there were an estimated 190 million people living in regions requiring trachoma control programs, 3.1 million who require surgery for trichiasis, and 1.9 million who are blind or have significant visual impairment from trachoma[.2–5](#page-6-1) The vast majority of these people live in the African region.

Trachoma prevalence estimates need to be interpreted with some caution, as various assumptions and extrapolations are used, and there is a relative lack of data from India and China. Small changes in the prevalence of either of these countries potentially has a large effect overall. However, it is clear that the numbers estimated to be affected by trachoma have shown large reductions in recent decades, and the number of countries that are thought to have eliminated trachoma (at least the active form) is increasing. This is probably partly a result of trachoma control strategies and general improvements in living and hygiene standards.

Loss of vision and ocular pain from trachoma lead to loss of economic productivity and quality of life, with the burden of disease estimated to be around 1.3 million disability-adjusted life years in 2004, although this is likely to be an under-estimation.[6–8](#page-6-2) Trachoma tends to be found in remote, rural areas; is strongly associated with poverty; and perpetuates the cycle of poverty and blindness.[9,10](#page-6-3)

#### **Clinical Features and Natural History**

Trachoma is a chronic keratoconjunctivitis caused by recurrent infection with *C. trachomatis.* Infection is most commonly found in children who manifest the "active" forms of the disease. With repeated episodes of reinfection, these children are at risk of developing the scarring complications of trachoma in later life. Active disease is characterized by a follicular and papillary conjunctivitis. Follicles are sub-epithelial collections of lymphoid cells and appear as small, yellow-white elevations on the conjunctiva of the everted upper lid ([Fig. 39.1](#page-1-0)). Papillary hypertrophy

(engorgement of small vessels with surrounding edema) also occurs and can obscure the deep tarsal vessels if severe enough. Vascular infiltration of the upper cornea (pannus) may also develop in active disease, although this tends not to affect vision. Individuals are often asymptomatic even with marked signs of inflammation. If present, symptoms are typical of those of a chronic conjunctivitis: redness, discomfort, light sensitivity, and muco-purulent discharge. All children in an endemic area will be infected at some point in their life and often on multiple occasions.

The prevalence of active disease and *C. trachomatis* infection is highest in young children and declines to low levels in adulthood ([Fig. 39.2](#page-1-1)). Active disease can be found in 60% of children under the age of 5 years, and half of the community bacterial load of *C. trachomatis* can be found in children under the age of 1 year in some studies.[11–13](#page-6-4) However, despite low levels of *C. trachomatis* infection in adults, the disease continues to progressively manifest its scarring sequelae. Initially, conjunctival scarring is seen in the sub-tarsal conjunctiva, which can range from a few linear or stellate scars to thick, distorting bands of fibrosis. Contraction of this scar tissue causes entropion (in-turning of the eyelids) and trachomatous trichiasis (eyelashes touching the eyeball). Eventually, the blinding end stage of the disease develops—corneal opacification—which is probably a result of a number of insults to the ocular surface: mechanical trauma from lashes, secondary bacterial or fungal infection, and a dry ocular surface. In contrast to other common causes of blindness such as cataract or uncorrected refraction, blindness from trachoma can be debilitating, painful, and, in practice, irreversible.

Over the years various grading systems for trachoma have been proposed[.9](#page-6-3) The one that is currently used by trachoma control programs is the 1987 WHO simplified grading system [\(Table 39.1](#page-2-0) and [Fig. 39.1\)](#page-1-0)[.14](#page-6-5) The five signs of the disease are independently assessed, but are not mutually exclusive, and two or more features can coexist in the same eye. Examination is usually performed in

The simplified system can be used by non-specialists with initial training and is useful for screening programs. Earlier, more detailed systems require experienced eye specialists to be performed.[15](#page-6-6)

The development of conjunctival scarring is strongly associated with previous conjunctival inflammation[.16](#page-6-7) A subgroup of children may have persistent infection and persistent, severe inflammation and are at increased risk of developing scarring.[17](#page-6-8) Estimates of the progression rate for scarring trachoma have been variable depending on the study site, burden of disease, and study methodology[.16](#page-6-7) A strong association between progressive scarring and conjunctival inflammation is also seen, but evidence for the role of *C. trachomatis* in scarring progression is limited, with infection rarely found in adults with scarring. Part of the reason for this may be because episodes of infection in adults, with the development of some protective immunity, are shorter and more difficult to detect[.18](#page-6-9) Alternatively, other factors, such as non-chlamydial bacterial infection, may be important in driving the scarring process in adults[.19](#page-6-10)

#### **Pathogenesis**

#### *Chlamydia* Biology

*C. trachomatis* is a small, gram-negative, obligate intracellular bacterium and only naturally infects humans. Trachoma is caused almost exclusively by the serotypes A, B, Ba, and C. The genital serotypes D–K can also cause a follicular "inclusion" conjunctivitis. The basis for the tissue tropism is not completely clear, with *ompA* typing probably not as reliable as previously thought, but ocular serotypes have lost the ability to synthesize tryptophan[.17](#page-6-8) *C. trachomatis* has developed ways of evading the host immune response, with a unique developmental life cycle involving intracellular invasion. An extracellular, infectious form, the elementary body, is around 0.5 µm in diameter, is metabolically inert, and is taken up by epithelial cells into intracellular inclusion bodies. Here they transform into reticulate bodies that are 1.5 µm in diameter and multiply by binary fission until there are thousands of organisms in the host cell inclusion bodies. The reticulate bodies then transform back into elementary bodies and are released by lysis of the host cell. This cycle takes between 24 and 48 hours in vitro*.*

#### Histopathology

A mixed inflammatory cell infiltrate is seen in active trachoma, with macrophages, T cells, polymorphonuclear leukocytes, dendritic cells, and plasma cells.[17,20](#page-6-8) Lymphoid follicles are the clinical and pathologic hallmark of trachoma. They are found in the stroma and consist largely of B cells with some macrophages and T cells with a surrounding lymphocytic mantle. Adults with scarring have a chronic inflammatory cell infiltrate with an abnormal or denuded epithelium. Thick, compact, and avascular scar tissue is found under the epithelium, which is firmly adherent to the tarsal plate.

#### Protective Immune Responses

An innate immune response is triggered by infection with release of a large array of inflammatory and chemotactic cytokines, many from the conjunctival epithelium[.20](#page-6-11) Animal models of genital tract infection suggest that clearance of infection is dependent on a type 1 T-helper cell response mediated through IFNγ. [21,22](#page-6-12) IFNγ has a number of anti-chlamydial actions, including depleting the levels of the essential amino acid tryptophan and iron and upregulating inducible nitric oxide synthase. A partial, protective immune response has been found after ocular *C. trachomatis* infection, although this is only serovar specific[.20](#page-6-11) Longitudinal studies have shown that the duration of infection and disease decreases with age, and this is probably a result of T-cell–dependent immune responses. The role of humoral immunity is less clear.

#### Immunopathology

Host immune responses are central to the development of pathology in trachoma, leading to scarring complications and loss of vision. Previous lines of investigation have led to the suggestion that a cell-mediated immune response to specific chlamydial antigens leads to tissue damage and fibrosis.[23,24](#page-6-13) Animal studies suggested that chlamydial heat shock protein 60, cHsp60, may be a key antigen leading to inflammation and fibrosis, with a delayed-type hypersensitivity reaction proposed[.20](#page-6-11) However, human studies have not been supportive of the role of cHsp60 in pathogenesis. More recent work involving conjunctival transcriptome studies and animal models of genital tract infection have supported the role of infected epithelial cells driving pathogenesis through innate pathways. Epithelial cells infected with *C. trachomatis* produce a large range of pro-inflammatory cytokines, chemokines, and growth factors. The subsequent recruitment of inflammatory immune cells, which help to clear infection, also cause tissue damage and fibrosis[.25](#page-6-14) Non-chlamydial bacterial pathogens have been associated with trachoma and may also stimulate innate, pro-inflammatory pathways leading to scarring progression[.19](#page-6-10) Host factors are also likely to be important, with 39% of the variability in lymphoproliferative responses to *C. trachomatis* antigens estimated to be a result of host genetic factors[.26](#page-6-15)

#### **Transmission and Risk Factors**

*C. trachomatis* is probably transmitted between individuals by a variety of mechanisms, including direct spread from eye to eye or indirect spread of ocular and nasal secretions on fingers, through use of contaminated fomites such as clothing, and possible transmission by eye-seeking flies[.27](#page-6-16) Trachoma is a focal disease and has been found to cluster at the level of the community, the household, and within bedrooms, reflecting the infectious nature of the disease and suggesting that prolonged contact is necessary for transmission of infection. No non-human reservoir has been found, with eyeseeking flies acting only as passive vectors.

A number of environmental, socio-economic, and behavioral factors have been associated with trachoma, although the interpretation of studies and potential confounding factors can be complex[.9,17,20](#page-6-3) Clean faces have been strongly linked with a lower risk of trachoma, and poor access to water increases the risk. However, how water is used and changing facial hygiene practices are complex issues with studies sometimes showing conflicting results. Overcrowding appears to be a risk factor for trachoma, with easier transfer of infected secretions. Women tend to have more scarring complications, thought to reflect increased contact with small children, the main reservoir of infection. Eye-seeking flies such as *Musca sorbens* may transmit trachoma, and reducing fly–eye contact through insecticide spraying or latrine provision lowers the risk, although trachoma can occur in the absence of flies.

#### **Trachoma Assessment**

#### Clinical Examination

The WHO defines trachoma as a public health problem when the prevalence of follicular trachoma, TF, is at least 10% in 1- to 9-year-olds, or the prevalence of trachomatous trichiasis, TT, is at least 1% in those over 14 years of age[.28](#page-6-17) A population-based prevalence survey, with cluster random sampling, gives good prevalence data on active disease and trichiasis and is the gold standard for assessing where trachoma is a public health problem[.27](#page-6-16) Clinical examination using the simplified WHO grading system is employed. The Global Trachoma Mapping Project has recently completed comprehensive global trachoma surveys to guide trachoma control programs.[29,30](#page-6-18)

#### Laboratory Tests

Earlier techniques for detecting ocular *C. trachomatis* infection have included Giemsa staining and microscopy of conjunctival samples, tissue culture (highly specific but expensive and time consuming), and direct immunofluorescent cytology and enzyme immunoassay (EIA) ([Table 39.2](#page-3-0)). However, these have largely been superseded by nucleic acid amplification tests. Amplification of *C. trachomatis* DNA or RNA from ocular swabs is highly sensitive and specific. It is also relatively expensive and requires good laboratory access. An area of concern is a mismatch that often exists between laboratory testing and clinical examination, especially in low-prevalence settings and those that have received mass treatment.[19](#page-6-10) This may be partly explained by the kinetics of the disease, with a latent phase (infection before signs) and a recovery phase (infection cleared but clinical signs of active trachoma persisting for many months), and the use of simple grading systems that do not reflect the spectrum of disease severity. The much higher levels of clinically detectable active trachoma compared with actual *C. trachomatis* infection, especially after mass antibiotic treatment, has raised the question of whether clinical examination is adequate to guide further management[.17,19](#page-6-8) Hopes for an inexpensive, reliable, field-based assay have not been realized, but selective testing of representative samples and shared used of laboratory facilities with other programs may help overcome reliance on clinical grading alone.[17](#page-6-8)

#### Differential Diagnosis

There are differential diagnoses to consider in the diagnosis of both active trachoma and trachomatous scarring ([Table 39.3](#page-4-0)). However, in the absence of laboratory tests, cases of follicular conjunctivitis and/or conjunctival scarring in known trachomaendemic areas, or that have risk factors for trachoma, are generally regarded as trachoma.

#### **Trachoma Control**

The Alliance for the Global Elimination of Blinding Trachoma by the year 2020 (GET 2020) was established by the WHO in 1997 and recommends the SAFE strategy for trachoma control: surgery, antibiotics, facial cleanliness, and environmental improvements[.31](#page-6-19)

#### Surgery for Trichiasis

The aim of surgery is to stop eyelashes abrading the cornea, reduce progression to corneal opacity, and relieve pain. Currently the WHO recommends the use of either the bilamellar tarsal rotation or the posterior lamellar tarsal rotation procedure to correct the trichiasis, with the posterior procedure recently reported to have better outcomes.[32–34](#page-6-20) Surgery has been shown to improve comfort, reduce ocular discharge, and improve visual acuity in trichiaisis cases, and is thought to reduce progression to corneal opacity. Major challenges need to be overcome for successful implementation of a trichiasis surgery program, including high recurrence rates; lack of training, equipment, and audit; low surgical productivity at outreach campaigns; and loss of surgeons to other jobs[.19,27](#page-6-10) Patient barriers to surgery include fear, lack of awareness, perceived costs, transport difficulties, other responsibilities, and lack of an escort. Ophthalmic nurses can be trained to deliver high-quality

surgery in the community where attendance rates are greater. The use of azithromycin after surgery may help reduce recurrence. Where only a few eyelashes are touching the eye, proper epilation of lashes has shown no differences to surgery in terms of vision or corneal opacity after 4 years, and can be considered an option where surgery is delayed, refused, or not available.[35](#page-6-21)

#### Antibiotics for *C. trachomatis* Infection

Mass antibiotic treatment of a community reduces the reservoir of *C. trachomatis* infection[.36](#page-6-22) The WHO recommends community mass treatment of all people over 6 months of age where the prevalence of active trachoma in children aged 1 to 9 years is over 10%, and coverage should be at least 80%.[37](#page-6-23) First-line treatment is a single oral dose of the macrolide antibiotic azithromycin (20 mg/kg, maximum 1 gram), which is generally extremely safe and well tolerated. Topical tetracycline ointment is an alternative, but this requires a 6-week course and adherence to treatment is often poor. Large-scale antibiotic distribution has only been possible through Pfizer's donation program through the International Trachoma Initiative. Community mass treatment should continue until the prevalence of follicular trachoma in 1- to 9-year-olds falls below 5%. Where the starting district-level prevalence of active disease is 10% to 30% mass treatment should continue for 3 years and then prevalence reassessed; where the starting prevalence is above 30% mass treatment should be continued for 5 years before reassessment. If the starting district-level prevalence is between 5% and 9% then targeted treatment is recommended at the sub-district level. There has been considerable debate, generation of studies, and mathematical modeling regarding optimal frequency and duration of treatment. In very high-prevalence communities biannual treatment may be more effective, and in low-prevalence communities a shorter duration of treatment may be adequate. However, in the absence of widespread testing for *C. trachomatis* infection WHO guidelines remain the best guide for treatment[.17](#page-6-8) Coverage rates in national programs may also be conspicuously lower than in research studies.

Resistance to azithromycin has not been observed in *C. trachomatis.* After multiple rounds of mass treatment with azithromycin, there is a shift in the prevalent *Streptococcus pneumoniae* strains carried in the nasopharynx to ones with greater macrolide resistance. However, this appears to be a temporary shift, with the prevalent strains tending to revert back to the pattern that preceded the introduction of treatment after this has been discontinued.[38](#page-6-24) Recent studies have shown that azithromycin distribution has been associated with significant reductions in diarrhea, respiratory tract infections, and a 50% reduction in childhood mortality[.19](#page-6-10) These additional benefits need careful consideration and follow-up in future studies.

#### Facial Cleanliness and Environmental Improvements to Interrupt *C. trachomatis* Transmission

The presence of ocular and/or nasal discharge has been consistently associated with trachoma, but may be a result of trachoma rather than a risk factor for transmission. Although the causative relationship between dirty faces and trachoma is not completely clear, and evidence that promotion of face washing actually reduces the prevalence of active trachoma is limited, facial hygiene is generally considered an important modifiable risk factor.[39](#page-6-25) Trachoma was once a major problem in Europe and North America and disappeared from these areas as a result of improved living conditions rather than mass antibiotic distribution. Environmental interventions involve components such as improving water and latrine access and use, reducing fly density, and providing health education. Without addressing these underlying hygiene issues, attempts to eliminate *C. trachomatis* infection with antibiotics alone are likely to lead to recurrence once distribution ceases. However, the evidence base for environmental improvements is poor and implementation in national trachoma control programs often limited or non-existent[.27,40](#page-6-16) Integration with national hygiene and sanitation programs may benefit this aspect of trachoma control.[17](#page-6-8)

#### **Conclusion**

The goal of eliminating blinding trachoma by 2020 has seen encouraging progress with reductions, particularly in active disease, in many countries. Concerted implementation of all components of the SAFE strategy is likely to have the most success in reducing blinding disease, and integration with control strategies for other neglected tropical diseases may provide a cost-effective way forward. Trachoma still continues to be a major problem in poor, rural areas in many countries, and there is a large backlog of trichiasis cases that needs to be addressed. There is also a large cohort of people with a history of recurrent *C. trachomatis* infection who remain at risk of future scarring complications.

#### **INCLUSION CONJUNCTIVITIS**

#### **Epidemiology**

*C. trachomatis* infection is the most common bacterial sexually transmitted infection worldwide[.41](#page-6-26) There were an estimated 131 million new cases of chlamydia among 15- to 49-year-olds in 2012, with the incidence highest among young women. The highest prevalence was in the region of the Americas and the Western Pacific region, but genital chlamydial infection is found worldwide. In contrast to trachoma, genital disease is caused by serotypes D–K, as discussed in the trachoma section earlier. The prevalence of *C. trachomatis* in pregnant women ranges from 2% to 20% depending on the population screened, with those under 25 years having the largest burden of infection.[42–47](#page-6-27)

#### **Clinical Features and Transmission**

The majority of those with genital tract *C. trachomatis* infection are asymptomatic, with implications for control measures, discussed later. Historical contact tracing studies reported genital infections from *C. trachomatis* to be asymptomatic in around 70% of women and 50% of men[.48](#page-6-28) However, these early studies were conducted using tests that have been superseded by more recent work using nucleic acid amplification, which has shown that asymptomatic infection is actually even more common: between 70% and 95.5% in women, and 25% to 100% in men[.49,50](#page-6-29) Urogenital symptoms in women include abnormal vaginal discharge, dysuria, and postcoital and intermenstrual bleeding. If infection ascends to the upper reproductive tract, then pelvic inflammatory disease, salpingitis, and tubal factor infertility can result. Symptoms in men include urethral discharge, dysuria, and testicular pain.

Transmission to the eye in adult inclusion conjunctivitis (AIC) is by autoinoculation in the vast majority of cases, either genital– hand–eye or genital–eye, with the infected genital secretions originating from either the patient or partner. The majority of affected patients have concomitant genital disease.[51](#page-6-30) Neonatal inclusion conjunctivitis (NIC) is usually transmitted by contact with infected secretions in the birth canal during delivery. A handful of cases have also been reported where infection has occurred after cesarean section in the presence of ruptured membranes and, more rarely, with intact membranes.[52–54](#page-6-31) The risk of transmission of *C. trachomatis* to an infant born through an infected birth canal has been reported to be approximately 50%, with the risk of chlamydial conjunctivitis in the order of 20% to 35% and 15% to 20% developing pneumonia[.55,56](#page-7-0) With modern detection techniques, these rates would be expected to be higher.

Ocular features in AIC typically develop 5 to 14 days after inoculation, presenting as an acute follicular conjunctivitis with redness and mucopurulent discharge. The follicular response is often more prominent in the lower tarsal conjunctiva and fornix, in contrast to trachoma. The infection is usually unilateral to start with, but may spread to the other eye, and is frequently associated with pre-auricular lymphadenopathy. Superficial punctate keratitis, peripheral sub-epithelial infiltrates, or pannus of the superior cornea may occur with time. NIC usually develops 5 to 14 days after birth, often with redness of both eyes. This may be associated with some discharge, lid swelling, pseudomembranes, and a papillary reaction, but the immune response is too immature to develop a follicular response at this stage. Rarely, conjunctival scarring and corneal pannus may develop in untreated cases. Although many cases of AIC and NIC may be self-limiting regarding the ocular disease, it can be critical to make the correct diagnosis so that appropriate systemic treatment is administered.

#### **Patient Evaluation, Diagnosis, and Differential Diagnosis**

Inclusion conjunctivitis is usually diagnosed clinically and confirmed by laboratory testing (see [Table 39.2\)](#page-3-0). Culture from a swab containing conjunctival epithelial cells was the "gold standard" for diagnosis, with high specificity and moderate sensitivity, dependent on user expertise. EIA and direct fluorescent antibody assays (DFAs) have high specificity, but sensitivity may be limited by the type of kit used. Nucleic acid amplification techniques (e.g., polymerase chain reaction [PCR]) have higher sensitivity than culture methods while retaining high specificity and thus have replaced the other techniques. If resources are limited, Giemsa-stained conjunctival scrapings can be examined for the presence of blue-stained intracytoplasmic inclusions within epithelial cells.

When inclusion conjunctivitis is identified in children beyond the neonatal period, child sexual abuse must be considered[.57](#page-7-1) Although persistence of infection has been reported for up to 3 years, there must be a high index of suspicion for sexual abuse, regardless of the age of the child. In post-pubertal girls consensual sexual activity should also be considered.[58](#page-7-2)

The differential diagnosis of AIC is similar to the differential of active trachoma (see [Table 39.3\)](#page-4-0). The most important differential diagnosis in neonates is conjunctivitis caused by *Neisseria gonorrhoeae.* However, this usually occurs earlier (2–5 days after birth) and is rapidly progressive, with a thick, purulent discharge and marked edema of the eyelids and conjunctiva. If possible, taking appropriate ocular samples is extremely important in all cases of neonatal conjunctivitis for microscopy, culture, and PCR to detect the causative micro-organism.

#### **Treatment**

The recommended treatment in adults and children (over 8 years of age and 45 kg in weight) with inclusion conjunctivitis is a single dose of oral azithromycin 1 g or doxycycline 100 mg orally twice a day for 7 days.[59–61](#page-7-3) In the UK there is a move away from use of the single dose of azithromycin with the appearance of rapidly emerging resistance to *Mycoplasma genitalium,* in addition to the evidence that a single dose of azithromycin is less effective in treatment of rectal chlamydia.[62](#page-7-4) Doxycycline is contraindicated in the second and third trimesters of pregnancy, and both the Centers for Disease Control (CDC) and WHO recommend azithromycin first[.59,63](#page-7-3) If second-line treatment is used to treat urogenital chlamydia—for example, erythromycin 500 mg four times a day for 7 days—a test of cure is advised. Topical tetracycline ointment or azithromycin drops could be considered as an adjunct, but the evidence for this is largely from trachoma studies[.31,64](#page-6-19) Most importantly, sexual partners need to be treated to reduce the risk of re-infection in addition to preventing the sequelae of untreated genital chlamydial infection.

WHO first-line therapy for NIC is now oral azithromycin 20 mg/kg/day orally, one dose daily for 3 days, in preference to erythromycin 50 mg/kg/day orally in four divided doses daily for 14 days.[63](#page-7-5) The CDC and American Academy of Ophthalmology recommend erythromycin base or ethyl succinate 50 mg/kg/day orally divided into four doses daily for 14 days, with azithromycin as an alternative regimen[.59,60](#page-7-3) A possible association between oral erythromycin and infantile hypertrophic pyloric stenosis (IHPS) has been reported, and it may also be less effective.[65](#page-7-6)

#### **Prevention and Control**

Annual screening of all sexually active women aged <25 years is recommended in the United States, as is screening of older women at increased risk for infection.[59](#page-7-3) This has led to a reduction in the prevalence of chlamydial infection, including AIC and other extra-genital complications. Other measures, including consistent condom use, presumptive treatment of sexual partners, and abstinence from sex until treatment is completed, can further reduce incidence of disease.

The most effective prevention method in reducing NIC is the screening and treatment of pregnant women. Chlamydia screening in the United States is recommended at the first prenatal visit for all pregnant women, and repeat screening during the third trimester is recommended for women aged <25 years or those at increased risk[.59,66,67](#page-7-3) The prevalence of NIC is lower in areas where routine screening and treatment of chlamydial infection in pregnant women occur, and where effective *C. trachomatis* screening programs are in place the incidence has dropped dramatically[.68](#page-7-7) The risk of re-infection or new infection in the third trimester has been shown to be as high as 13% in some settings, further supporting this screening and re-screening policy[.42](#page-6-27) A test of cure is recommended for the mother 3 to 4 weeks after treatment to ensure eradication. Erythromycin eye ointment has previously been recommended as a prophylactic agent to prevent neonatal conjunctivitis[.60](#page-7-8) However, there is no evidence that prophylactic treatment should be given to infants born to mothers with untreated chlamydial infection, and there is also no evidence that infants with chlamydial infections should be isolated (standard hygiene precautions are recommended).[59](#page-7-3)
