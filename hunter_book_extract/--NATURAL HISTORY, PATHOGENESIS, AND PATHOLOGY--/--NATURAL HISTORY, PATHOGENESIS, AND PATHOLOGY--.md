centers. The spread of the virus is probably a consequence of the circulation of viremic people in localities where the transmitting vector can be found and where there is a large concentration of susceptible individuals.[4](#page-0-2)

# **NATURAL HISTORY, PATHOGENESIS, AND PATHOLOGY**

Oropouche fever is a self-limiting, febrile illness with no fatalities recorded. Using molecular typing methods, four different OROV genotypes have been described in the Americas.[3–5](#page-0-1) Little is known about the pathogenesis of the Oropouche fever in humans—most of the information on pathogenesis has been obtained in experimental studies on golden hamsters. As in humans, the viremic period in these animals is brief and reaches titers high enough to easily infect *C. paraensis* midges.[2](#page-0-3) In lethal infections in hamsters, intense encephalitis is observed with a prominent hepatitis, the probable mechanism of animal deaths.[1](#page-0-0)

# **CLINICAL FEATURES**

Clinically, Oropouche fever is characterized by the sudden onset of high fever, headache, myalgia, arthralgia, anorexia, dizziness, chills, and photophobia. Some patients present with a morbilliform exanthem that resembles rubella or dengue. Nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, conjunctiva congestion, epigastric and retro-ocular pain, and other constitutional symptoms are also common[.1](#page-0-0) Some patients may display a picture of aseptic meningitis, and others temporary encephalitis. A recrudescence of mild symptoms several days after waning of the initial febrile episode is commonly seen (biphasic illness). Recovery is complete in all individuals without apparent sequelae, even in the most severe cases. There are no reports of proven lethality caused by Oropouche fever.[2](#page-0-3)

# **PATIENT EVALUATION, DIAGNOSIS, AND DIFFERENTIAL DIAGNOSIS**

The differential diagnosis includes other causes of febrile illness, particularly dengue fever, chikungunya fever, and malaria. Blood samples collected during the acute phase of illness (up to 5 days after the onset of the symptoms) can be used for virus detection methods. The most commonly applied molecular method is reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR)[,3–5](#page-0-1) and recently a real-time PCR showed excellent results.[6](#page-0-4) Virus isolation can be attempted in newborn mice or hamsters (1–3 days), or in Vero or C6/36 cell cultures. For viral identification, suspensions prepared from brains of mice or supernatants of infected Vero or C6/36 cells are used as antigens in complement fixation or immunofluorescence assays with OROV hyper-immune serum. More recently the molecular approaches have been used for genotyping and identification of isolates[.3–6](#page-0-1) For specific identification of OROV, neutralization and hemagglutination inhibition tests can be also performed[.2](#page-0-3)

## **TREATMENT AND PREVENTION**

Treatment is supportive, common analgesics should be used to relieve the headache and muscle and joint pains, in particular to treat retrobulbar pain that in general is severe. No vaccine is available to prevent Oropouche fever; only personal control measures are recommended, including use of repellents.

*Pedro F. C. Vasconcelos, Marcio R. T. Nunes*

### KEY FEATURES

- • Mayaro fever virus is an alphavirus responsible for sporadic cases and several outbreaks of illness with fever, arthralgia, and rash in northern South America.
- • Some infected patients develop severe arthralgia during the defervescence period that can last up to a year.
- • Three Mayaro fever virus genotypes are recognized.
- • Mayaro fever virus is transmitted by *Haemagogus* mosquitoes, particularly *H. janthinomys.*
- • The main vertebrate hosts are non-human primates.
- • In the Brazilian Amazon, the specific antibody rate ranges from 5% to 60%; it is higher among closed communities (South American Indians) in the forests.

#### **INTRODUCTION**

Mayaro virus (MAYV) is a single-stranded, positive-sense, arthropod-borne RNA virus in the family Togaviridae, genus *Alphavirus.* Typically, it causes Mayaro fever, an acute fever illness, accompanied by intense arthralgia and a rash syndrome.[1](#page-1-0) Mayaro virus causes sporadic cases or small outbreaks in forest workers, but has caused a few larger epidemics, particularly in Brazil and nearby South American countries, especially in people living in communities near or inside the forest. The original isolation of Mayaro virus occurred in Trinidad and Tobago in 1954 from the blood of febrile patients. Two major epidemics were described in the Brazilian Amazon regio[n2](#page-1-1) ; smaller epidemics have been recognized since then in other parts of Brazil and in Santa Cruz, Bolivia.[3,4](#page-1-2) Mayaro virus is maintained in nature in a cycle involving mammals, birds, and hematophagous arthropods. New World non-human primates and marmosets have been implicated as natural hosts.[5](#page-1-3) The virus has been isolated several times from *Haemagogus* spp. mosquitoes, mainly from *H. janthinomys* species, which is considered the primary potential vector. There are three distinct genotypes of the virus. In addition, a unique strain of Mayaro virus has been recovered from *Coquillettidia venezuelensis* in Trinidad, two others from *Sabethes* spp., and one from *Culex* spp., which can represent spillover of the virus from the hosts.

#### **EPIDEMIOLOGY**

Mayaro virus has been isolated from patient residents in tropical areas of Central and South America, mainly in Brazil, Trinidad and Tobago, Bolivia, Surinam, and Haiti. The virus has also been isolated in French Guiana, Colombia, Panama, and Peru. Detection of antibodies to the virus has been also demonstrated in certain populations of these countries, as well as in Guyana, Colombia, and Peru[.2](#page-1-1) Most cases occur in forest workers, who are typically adult males. In the Brazilian Amazon, the specific antibody rate ranges from 5% to 60%; it is higher among closed communities (South American Indians).

Only a few major Mayaro fever epidemics have been reported in the Americas: two in Brazil, one in Bolivia, and one in Peru[.2,6](#page-1-1) Between 1955 and 1991, epidemics of Mayaro fever were restricted to Brazil, beginning in the municipality of Guamá, Pará state (1955), and spreading toward other localities in the São Miguel do Pará state, such as Belterra (1978), Conceição do Araguaia (1981), Itaruma in Goias state, the central region of Brazil (1981), Benevides, Pará state (1991), and Peixe, Tocantins state (1991). In the following years, the agent reached other Peruvian Amazon counties (Tumbes, Aucayacu, and Huanuco in 1995)[.6](#page-1-4) In 2008 the virus re-emerged in Pará state causing an outbreak in the municipality of Santa Bárbara, Pará state, 50 km from Belém in northern Brazil,[4](#page-1-5) and in 2014 to 2016 small outbreaks were also reported in central Brazil in the states of Mato Grosso and Goiás, where this agent is considered an emerging virus.

# **NATURAL HISTORY, PATHOGENESIS, AND PATHOLOGY**

Little is known about the pathogenesis of Mayaro fever in humans, as the virus has not been associated with deaths. Thus no material is available for histopathologic examination[.1](#page-1-0) The data regarding its pathogenesis are a result of experimental in vitro studies using Vero cell cultures. These have indicated intense cytopathic effects and cell death, with casein kinase 2 (CK2) having an important role during the Mayaro virus infection cycle[.7](#page-1-6)

## **CLINICAL FEATURES**

Mayaro fever is clinically characterized as an acute febrile illness, generally accompanied by headache, myalgia, rash, chills, and photophobia. Dizziness, eye pain, nausea, and vomiting are less frequently reported. Arthralgia, predominantly affecting the wrists, fingers, ankles, and toes, as well as a cutaneous rash, are also commonly observed on the trunk and extremities[.2,3](#page-1-1) Occasionally, there may also be painful joint swelling that can persist. In some patients, arthralgia lasts up to a year. An aspect to consider is the possibility of co-circulation of MAYV and chikungunya virus (CHIKV) in a same area, because both viruses are members of the Semliki Forest group in the *Alphavirus* genus, and a high cross-reactivity is present in serologic tests even on IgM-ELISA (enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay). Thus the molecular biology approaches are more indicated to confirm MAYV and/or CHIKV infection; indeed, the real-time polymerase chain reaction (PCR) is the gold standard diagnostic test to make a confirmation of infection by both viruses.

# **PATIENT EVALUATION, DIAGNOSIS, AND DIFFERENTIAL DIAGNOSIS**

Leukopenia is a common finding in unspecific laboratory tests within the first week of illness, and a white cell count of about 2500/mm3 is commonly observed; platelet counts and liver function tests are usually normal. The differential diagnosis includes other causes of fever, arthralgia, and rash, particularly dengue, Oropouche, chikungunya, and Zika fever viruses. The laboratory diagnosis of Mayaro fever either depends on virus isolation attempts or serologic diagnostic and molecular methods for genome detection. For virus isolation, biologic samples (serum or blood) obtained from viremic patients (up to 5 days after the onset of the symptoms) are used for inoculation in newborn mice or in Vero cells. Suspensions prepared from brains of mice or supernatants of infected cells are used as antigens in either complement fixation tests or an immunofluorescence assay against hyperimmune sera of different arboviruses circulating in the region. Specific identification of Mayaro virus is carried out using neutralization and hemagglutination inhibition test[s1](#page-1-0) and by reverse transcription (RT)–PCR[,3,4](#page-1-2) as well as by real-time PCR, that has showed excellent results[.8](#page-1-7)

#### **TREATMENT AND PREVENTION**

Treatment is supportive. Some patients require hospitalization, but no deaths have been reported. In theory, personal protection against mosquito bites (insect repellent and long sleeves and trousers) should be protective, but this is not practical for most forest workers. Bed nets and window screens are of little benefit because *Haemagogus* mosquitoes are day biters. In addition, no vaccine is available to prevent Mayaro fever.
