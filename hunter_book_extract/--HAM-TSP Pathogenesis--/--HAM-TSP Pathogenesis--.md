is the major driver of viral transcription and transformation, and it also functions at transcriptional and post-transcriptional steps during transformation by up-regulating several interleukins, cytokines, adhesion molecules, growth-promoting factors, and apoptosis-inhibiting factors. However, in a significant majority of ATL cases, *tax* expression is lost. In contrast, ATL tumors always express *hbz,* which produces a protein, HBZ, that supports the proliferation of tumor cells in vivo and in vitro. Current data suggest that Tax is responsible for initiating transformation, while HBZ provides maintenance functions or cell survival signals. There are no data for insertional mutagenesis, activation of tumor suppressor genes, or activation of proto-oncogenes as part of the pathogenesis of HTLV-I–mediated tumorigenesis; however, low incidence and long latency suggest contribution by both cellmediated and viral mechanisms.[5–7](#page-3-1)

# **HAM/TSP Pathogenesis**

HAM/TSP likely is caused by both immunologic and genetic factors. HTLV-I–specific cytotoxic T cells control infection by destroying infected CD4 cells. These cells are unable to eradicate the infection, and a steady state of immune activation is established. Patients with HAM/TSP have increased pro-inflammatory cytokines, high levels of HTLV-I–specific CD8<sup>+</sup> T cells, and higher pro-viral loads. In Japanese populations genomic alterations involving cytokines have also been shown to be associated with an increased incidence of HAM/TSP[.8](#page-3-2)

# **CLINICAL FEATURES**

Although most patients with HTLV infection will remain asymptomatic, certain individuals are at higher risk for infectious, neurologic, dermatologic, rheumatologic, autoimmune, and malignant diseases.

### **Adult T-Cell Leukemia/Lymphoma**

HTLV-I–associated ATL occurs mainly in adults, usually 20 to 40 years after HTLV-I infection. Only about 5% of HTLV-I– infected persons in endemic foci develop ATL. ATL is divided into four categories in the Shimoyama classification ([Table](#page-0-0) [38.8.3](#page-0-0)). HTLV-I–infected individuals with circulating abnormal lymphocytes who do not meet criteria for one of the subtypes are classified as pre-ATL. The acute type is the most common, followed by lymphomatous, chronic, and then smoldering. ATL is most commonly seen in southwestern Japan, with vertical transmission and breastfeeding posing the highest risk for disease development.[4,5](#page-3-0)

### Symptoms

Most patients present with lymphadenopathy; half have hepatosplenomegaly, and a third have skin manifestations in the form

of a nodular, indurated rash. With metastasis, ATL can affect the lungs, gastrointestinal tract, central nervous system, and musculoskeletal system. Patients with indolent ATL may progress to a more aggressive form, and patients with pre-ATL may spontaneously revert to an asymptomatic state or progress to malignancy.[4,5,8](#page-3-0)

### Diagnosis

ATL is suspected with the clinical findings of lymphadenopathy, rash, and hepatosplenomegaly. Early in the disease, complete blood counts reveal leukocytosis without anemia or thrombocytopenia, due to a lack of bone marrow involvement. Acute and lymphomatype ATL are strongly suspected when characteristic flower cells are seen on blood smear—these are atypical, multi-lobulated, pleomorphic lymphoid cells with abnormal-appearing nuclei and basophilic cytoplasm, and patients with aggressive ATL typically have >5% of these cells. HTLV-I pro-virus can be detected in abnormal nuclei of flower cells or in biopsies of lesions. Monoclonal pro-viral integration is found in all ATL cases, and integrated defective pro-viruses also have some classification and prognostic value. Bone marrow examination, radiologic imaging, endoscopy to assess for gastrointestinal involvement, cytogenetics, serum lactate dehydrogenase (LDH), and immunophenotypic analysis may also be helpful in directing therapeutic approaches[.5](#page-3-1)

Metabolically, hypercalcemia is common (30%–60%), and is due to both parathyroid hormone (PTH)–related peptide overproduction by Tax protein and liberation of calcium from lytic bony lesions.[8](#page-3-2)

### Treatment

Treatments for ATL include conventional and intensive chemotherapeutic regimens, allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation, anti-virals, and antiretrovirals. Conventional chemotherapy remains the mainstay of treatment, though median survival times with commonly used chemotherapeutic regimens are only a little more than 1 year. In all patients, except those with lymphoma subtype of aggressive ATL, first-line treatment with zidovudine and interferon-α will significantly improve survival.[9](#page-3-3) Several targeted therapies, from monoclonal antibodies to the immunomodulatory drug lenalidomide, are currently under investigation and have shown mixed success. Because of immunosuppression, patients often succumb to opportunistic illness such as *Pneumocystis jirovecii* pneumonia, cryptococcal meningitis, and disseminated herpes zoster. These illnesses, as well as pulmonary and liver dysfunction, uncontrolled hypercalcemia, and sepsis, are the main causes of mortality[.5](#page-3-1)

## **HTLV-I–Associated Myelopathy/Tropical Spastic Paraparesis**

### General

The association of HTLV-I and HAM/TSP was first noted in the Caribbean and South America (hence the original name tropical spastic paraparesis). Soon thereafter, HTLV-I–positive patients in southern Japan were noted to have similar clinical findings, and the name was changed to HTLV-I–associated myelopathy/tropical spastic paraparesis (HAM/TSP).

The lifetime risk of developing HAM/TSP in an HTLV-I carrier is estimated at 0.25% to 3%, depending on endemic region, with higher incidence in South America and the Caribbean than southern Japan. Most reported cases are due to HTLV-I infection; however, 1% of patients infected with HTLV-II in the HTLV Outcomes Study have also developed HAM/TSP. HAM/TSP presents as an indolent and progressive spastic paraparesis with bladder disturbances and sensory signs, usually in adults (mean age of onset 40–50 years), though there are rare reported cases

in children.[10](#page-3-4) The disease is more common in women, and women progress faster than men for unknown reasons.

The most common risk factor for HAM/TSP is sexually acquired HTLV-I infection.[11](#page-3-5) Blood transfusion is also an important risk factor. In a Japanese case control study, more patients with HAM/ TSP self-reported blood transfusion than did controls (20% compared with 3%–5%)[.12](#page-3-6) In Peru, Martinique, and Brazil, 20% to 30% of HAM/TSP patients reported an episode of blood transfusion[,13](#page-3-7) and there are documented cases in France and the United States with molecular evidence linking donor and recipient.[14,15](#page-3-8)

Risk factors for rapid progression include female gender, older age at disease onset, and increased HTLV-I pro-viral loads[.16,17](#page-3-9) Some studies suggested a role for polymorphisms in the IL-10 (interleukin-10) promotor and IL-28B gene.[18,19](#page-3-10) Though not studied in randomized control trials, the incidence of HAM/ TSP seems to be increased in the setting of HIV infection, possibly by 7% to 8%. HTLV-II–associated disease appears to be milder and have a more slowly progressive course.

## Symptoms

In general, HAM/TSP is a chronic, sub-acute, and progressive disease characterized by spasticity and/or hyperreflexia, urinary bladder dysfunction, and sensory disturbances[.20](#page-3-11) Neurologic findings are often the first manifestations of the disease, and if they are not, they usually appear within the first year. In 60% of patients, weakness in the lower limbs is the first symptom. Patients then go on to develop a spastic gait with hyperreflexia and extensor plantar responses. Urologic symptoms are also common and vary from urgency and frequency to incontinence and retention. Other symptoms and syndromes commonly seen are back pain, constipation, and paresthesias[.20,21](#page-3-11) Of note, significant pain is a frequently mentioned symptom, adding to the disability caused by the disease.

### Diagnosis

Diagnostic criteria for HAM/TSP were developed by the World Health Organization (WHO) in 1989. A new set of diagnostic criteria were proposed by De Castro-Costa et al. in 2006 after reviewing previously published articles of over 3000 patients with HAM/TSP[.22](#page-3-12) These new criteria include diagnostic levels—definite, probable, and possible—based on clinical characteristics, serologic and/or virologic confirmation, and exclusion of other diagnoses. Another study has proposed HTLV-I pro-viral load in cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) as a diagnostic tool, but it remains prohibitively expensive in most endemic areas.[23](#page-3-13) The WHO criteria remain the scheme most commonly followed in the literature.

Symptoms of HAM/TSP can mimic other disease entities, and pursuance of this diagnosis requires the exclusion of other processes, summarized in [Box 38.8.1](#page-1-0).

### Monitoring and Treatment

Patients with HAM/TSP should be monitored clinically on a regular basis for any change in symptoms and function. Laboratory

### <span id="page-1-0"></span>**BOX 38.8.1** Differential Diagnosis of HAM/TSP

Spinal cord tumors Compressive lesions of the spinal cord Multiple sclerosis Toxic neuropathies Amyotrophic lateral sclerosis Lathyrism (due to ingestion of grass pea) Konzo (due to ingestion of cassava root)

markers that may be used for disease monitoring are the HTLV pro-viral load and the quantitative measurement of HTLV-I Tax mRNA by polymerase chain reaction (PCR)[.24](#page-3-14) Whereas the former has the most data supporting an association with disease progression, the latter has been implicated to identify populations of HTLV-I– infected cells that are influencing the host immune response.

Many treatments have been attempted for patients with HAM/ TSP, but none has been shown to decrease long-term disability. A summary of treatment modalities attempted is found in [Table 38.8.4](#page-1-1).

### **General Infections**

A wide variety of infectious diseases, including crusted scabies, molluscum contagiosum, extrapulmonary histoplasmosis, TB, leprosy, and strongyloidiasis, are associated with HTLV-I in case reports and series of HTLV-I–infected patients. A review of over 1200 blood donors in the United States revealed a significantly higher incidence of kidney and bladder infections with HTLV-I infection. HTLV-II infection was associated with higher incidence of bronchitis, bladder or kidney infections, and oral herpes. Additionally, there was a trend toward higher incidence of pneumonia in HTLV-II patients.[25](#page-3-15)

Specific infectious diseases associated with HTLV-I infection are reviewed next.

### Other Neurologic Manifestations

Other neurologic syndromes associated with HTLV-I infection, which do not meet the case definition of HAM/TSP, include leg weakness, impaired gait, hyperreflexia, and impaired vibratory sense[.20](#page-3-11) In one study of HTLV-I–infected patients in Brazil,

pro-viral load was shown to be higher in patients with non-HAM/ TSP neurologic disease than in asymptomatic carriers[.26](#page-3-16) A longitudinal cohort study found that up to 30% of infected patients developed non-HAM/TSP neurologic symptoms over 8 years, but results should be interpreted with caution, given the lack of control group and self-report of symptoms.[27](#page-3-17)

### Infective Dermatitis and Scabies

Dermatologic alterations are seen commonly in the setting of HTLV infection and include dermatophyte infections, seborrheic dermatitis, acquired ichthyosis, infective dermatitis (ID), scabies, and others.

ID was first described in Jamaica in the 1960s, and studies in the Caribbean confirm a strong association with HTLV-I infection.[28](#page-3-18) La Grenade et al. proposed diagnostic criteria to help differentiate ID from the similarly presenting skin conditions atopic dermatitis and seborrheic dermatitis. Symptoms of ID include eczema about the scalp, ears, and face, with nasal crusting and a fine papular rash. Children typically have chronic watery discharge, and their anterior nares are frequently colonized with *Staphylococcus aureus* or β-hemolytic streptococci. ID responds rapidly to antibiotics and topical steroids, only to relapse chronically once these treatments are withdrawn. The presence of ID in children has been implicated as a marker of risk for development of HAM/TSP.

Scabies is known to have atypical presentations and potentially be a marker for ATL in patients with HTLV-I infection. Treatments are either topical (permethrin cream) or oral (ivermectin) in severe cases.

## Tuberculosis and Other Mycobacterial Disease

Multiple studies demonstrate increased prevalence of HTLV-I infection in patients diagnosed with TB, including a study showing 10% of TB patients in an infectious disease hospital in Salvador, Bahia, were co-infected with HTLV-I[.29](#page-3-19) Studies have also demonstrated an association of increased risk of *Mycobacterium tuberculosis* infection and disease severity in HTLV-I–infected individuals[.30–32](#page-3-20) These studies also suggest the association between HTLV-I and TB may lead to worse prognosis of TB and perhaps increased incidence of HAM/TSP[.33,34](#page-3-21)

Pulmonary *M. avium* infection is more common and more severe in HTLV-I–infected patients.[35](#page-3-22) A recent study of Brazilian patients with Hansen's disease demonstrated at 2.5% co-infection rate with HTLV-I and found more severe nerve impairment and higher relapse rate in co-infected patients[.36](#page-3-23)

### *Strongyloides stercoralis* Infection

There is strong evidence for the relationship between *Strongyloides stercoralis* and HTLV.[37](#page-3-24) HTLV-I infection is a well-known and significant risk factor for the development of hyperinfection syndrome or disseminated strongyloidiasis that may be related to HTLV-I–driven alterations in IgE or associated type 2 responses.[38–40](#page-3-25) A growing body of evidence suggests a synergistic relationship in which higher rates of *S. stercoralis* infection and complications are found in HTLV-I patients and *S. stercoralis* infection influences the natural history of HTLV-I infection.[38,41](#page-3-25)

### Rheumatologic and Pulmonary Conditions

Multiple rheumatologic diseases are described with HTLV-I detected in target tissues. These conditions include polymyositis, Sjögren's syndrome, uveitis, and arthropathy.[42–45](#page-3-26)

An association between HTLV-I infection and bronchiectasis has been demonstrated in populations of indigenous Australians and a UK cohort[.46,47](#page-3-27)

# **PATIENT EVALUATION, DIAGNOSIS, AND DIFFERENTIAL DIAGNOSIS**

HTLV infection should be in the differential diagnosis when patients in or from endemic areas present with ATL, HAM/TSP, neurologic syndromes, or any of the infectious syndromes outlined earlier. Since the late 1980s, the Food and Drug Administration recommended screening of whole blood for HTLV I/II antibodies. This is done by enzyme immunoassay (EIA) or particle agglutination test. Confirmation via Western blot or PCR is necessary, especially in low-prevalence areas where rates of false-positive serology are common.

Recommendations for counseling of patients presenting with positive HTLV-I/II serology have been published previously[.48](#page-3-28) Health care workers should inform patients first and foremost that HTLV is not the virus that causes AIDS, as this is a source of common confusion and anxiety for patients. Second, patients should be screened for risk factors for HTLV infection, including living in an endemic area, sexual partners from an endemic area, blood transfusions in the United States before 1988, history of injection drug use, sexual partners with histories of injection drug use, or having sex with multiple partners without condom use. Patients with a history of intravenous drug use or unprotected sex should also undergo HIV testing.

Confirmed cases of HTLV infection should be referred to a physician with experience in the field. Complete physical examination with special attention to lymph nodes, skin lesions, liver, spleen, and neurologic examination should be completed. Baseline laboratory evaluation includes a complete blood count with differential, serum chemistries, complete sexually transmitted infection screening, hepatitis serologies, testing for latent TB infection, and chest radiography.

HTLV-I–infected individuals should be informed of their increased risk for autoimmune disease, HAM/TSP, and malignancy. These patients should be followed more closely with prompt referrals to specialists such as neurologists or hematologists if examination or blood count changes occur, respectively.

HTLV-II–infected patients can be reassured that their overall risk of major illness is low. Upon meeting with health care providers, these patients should be informed of the potential sequelae of HTLV-II infection. Specifically, they should understand the increased risk of urinary, kidney, and upper and lower respiratory tract infections. For these reasons, clinicians need to counsel patients about smoking cessation and consider offering patients pneumococcal vaccination. As neurologic abnormalities not meeting criteria for HAM/TSP are commonly seen, referral to a neurologist for evaluation should take place if any of these symptoms arise[.8](#page-3-2)

### **TREATMENT**

Potential therapies for the more severe manifestations of HTLV-I/ II infection have been discussed earlier. No definitive treatment for primary HTLV infection in the absence of such manifestations is available or currently recommended. The nucleoside analogs zidovudine and lamivudine have both been shown to decrease pro-viral loads in small in vitro and in vivo trials, respectively[.49,50](#page-3-29) These studies are from small case series, and opinions are conflicting in the literature. However, no change in clinical outcome has been demonstrated from use of these medications to date. Prevention measures (refraining from breastfeeding and blood donation, condom use) are recommended to avoid transmission of the virus to others.
