# KEY FEATURES

- • The importance of nontyphoid *Salmonella* (NTS) as a cause of invasive disease (iNTS disease) in Africa has overtaken their importance as a cause of diarrheal illness and enterocolitis.
- • iNTS disease disproportionately affects very young children and adults with advanced HIV infection, in whom it is considered an AIDS-defining illness.
- • The nonspecific clinical presentation of invasive NTS disease and frequent occurrence of co-infections such as pneumonia, malaria, and tuberculosis (TB) presents diagnostic challenges and complicates treatment decisions.
- • The decision to initiate antibiotic therapy for iNTS disease is, however, usually based on clinical suspicion alone. The emergence of multidrug-resistant, and more recently extended spectrum beta-lactamase producing NTS strains, presents additional management challenges.
- • High mortality rates and frequent recurrence after discontinuation of therapy underscore the importance of iNTS disease.

# **INTRODUCTION**

The importance of nontyphoid *Salmonella* (NTS) as a cause of invasive disease in Africa has overtaken its importance as a cause of diarrheal illness and enterocolitis. NTS has been a significant cause of invasive bacterial disease among children in the tropics, particularly in sub-Saharan Africa (SSA), for many decades, predating the HIV pandemic. In 1983 the first six cases of AIDS presenting among African adults were described, three of whom had *Salmonella* Typhimurium bacteremia[.1,2](#page-5-0) Invasive NTS (iNTS) disease, associated with AIDS in Africa, was first described as being predominantly caused by *S.* Typhimurium, with an absence of diarrhea and a high recurrence rate,[3](#page-5-1) and these are now all wellrecognized features of this illness. Recurrent NTS bacteremia was added to the Centers for Disease Control (CDC) case definition of AIDS in 1987. As the HIV pandemic has evolved, iNTS disease has become one of the most common causes of febrile adult admission in SSA. iNTS disease in children and HIV-infected adults carries an estimated case fatality rate (CFR) of 19%[4](#page-5-2) ; even with appropriate antibiotic treatment, there is a 30% to 50% rate of recurrence. Empiric diagnosis and management remain challenging, multi-drug resistance (MDR) to commonly used agents is common, and extended-spectrum beta lactamase (ESBL)–producing isolates are now reported from Africa.

# **EPIDEMIOLOGY**

Blood culture series of febrile adults and children in HIV-endemic Africa have consistently shown that NTS is one of the most common causes of invasive bacterial infection, together with *Streptococcus pneumoniae* and *Mycobacterium tuberculosis* [\(Fig. 49.1](#page-1-0))[.5](#page-5-3) The most recent estimate of the global burden of iNTS disease was made for 2010, and the incidence is highest in SSA, at 227 cases (range 152–341) per 100,000 population, with an estimated 388,000 deaths/year.[6](#page-5-4) *S.* Typhimurium and *S.* Enteritidis are the most commonly isolated serovars. In contrast, in North Africa, where HIV prevalence is lower and malaria is not endemic, *S.* Typhi is often the most common blood isolate.[5,7](#page-5-3) Co-infection with malaria and iNTS is common in febrile children from high-malaria-transmission areas compared with those from lowmalaria-transmission area[s8,9](#page-5-5); conversely typhoid fever is uncommon in febrile children from high-malaria-transmission areas.[8](#page-5-5) An increase in iNTS disease coincided with an increase in HIV prevalence in Thailand, but iNTS remains much less common in Asia than *S.* Typhi and *S.* Paratyphi A in all ages.

A major assessment of the etiology of moderate and severe diarrhea in Africa and Asia was recently made in seven countries, and although *Salmonella* was significantly associated with diarrhea, the prevalence was low.[10](#page-5-6) Most healthy African children appear to have been exposed to *Salmonella,* presumably during early intestinal infection, and acquired killing antibodies by the age of 16 months[.11](#page-5-7) Among African children, the rate of asymptomatic carriage in the stool may be nearly as high as the rate of detection during diarrheal disease,[9](#page-5-8) but this is not a universal finding.

iNTS disease occurs in a bimodal age distribution in Africa, peaking among young children aged 6 to 24 months and among adults aged 20 to 45 years ([Fig. 49.2](#page-1-1))[.12](#page-5-9) Conservative estimates of the incidence of pediatric iNTS in SSA range from 170 to 388 per 100,000 person-years in children under the age of 3 years; this drops to 6/100,000 in children over the age of 5 years[.13,14](#page-5-10) There is a lower incidence among infants in the first 4 months of life, consistent with protection from maternal immunoglobulin (Ig)G or from secretory IgA in breastmilk[,11](#page-5-7) but NTS is a significant cause of neonatal sepsis and meningitis[.15,16](#page-5-11)

In children, malaria is associated with an increased risk of invasive bacterial disease, including iNTS. Increased complement consumption (including C1q, C4, C3, and C5–9) during acute malaria has been demonstrated[,17–19](#page-5-12) and this appears to contribute to loss of both cell-free and phagocyte-mediated killing of NTS despite high antibody titers to lipopolysaccharide (LPS) in African children.[19](#page-5-13) Malaria-derived products (malaria-infected red blood cells [RBCs] and hemozoin, hemoglobin-derived heme, and heme oxygenase-1 [HO-1]) compromise the effector functions of neutrophils, monocytes, and macrophages in humans and animals favoring the proliferation of NTS.[20–23](#page-5-14) Furthermore, malaria induces an anti-inflammatory environment (increased interleukin [IL]-10 production and reduced IL-12 production), which is favorable for the growth of NTS within the gastrointestinal tract and systemic circulation.[24–27](#page-5-15)

Compared with other bacterial pathogens in children, iNTS is associated with severe anemia, often in the context of malaria[.28–31](#page-5-16) Studies have shown that malaria, particularly severe malariaassociated anemia, is a key risk factor for iNTS.[32,33](#page-5-17) Malaria-induced destruction of infected-RBCs allows the release of iron and heme, which promote intracellular bacterial growth and inhibit the effector functions of phagocytes[.20,34,35](#page-5-14) Sickle cell anemia is strongly associated with iNTS in African children, although this is not a common risk factor. The susceptibility may be attributed to reduced serum bactericidal activity as a result of defective function of the alternative complement pathway and low concentration of C3.[36](#page-5-18) HIV infection is also a major risk factor for iNTS disease in African children, but in contrast to adults, the majority of children with iNTS

disease are not HIV infected. In one study from Malawi, however, HIV was a major independent risk factor for mortality[.37](#page-5-19)

In adults, advanced HIV infection is the major risk factor for iNTS disease in SSA, with over 95% of cases occurring in HIVinfected individuals[.7,38](#page-5-20) The incidence of iNTS in antiretroviral treatment (ART)–naïve HIV-infected adults ranges from 2000 to 8500/100,000 person-years of observation. Events are rare at high CD4 counts but rise up to 9000/100,000 with CD4 <200 cells/µL[.39](#page-5-21) The impact of widely available ART in Africa is not yet clear but is likely to be highly protective against primary and recurrent iNTS disease where coverage is optimal.

Other conditions predisposing adults to iNTS disease include diabetes, long-term steroid use, hematologic or solid cancers, autoimmune disease, advanced liver disease (particularly alcoholic liver disease), renal or other transplantation, and the use of other immunosuppressive drugs, including anti–tumor necrosis factor (TNF) antibody treatment. iNTS disease is also seen in children with specific primary immunodeficiencies, including chronic granulomatous disease and rare genetic deficiencies of cytokine subunits or receptors in the IL-12/IL-23 pathway.[39](#page-5-21)

iNTS incidence in both adults and children is associated with seasonal rainfall ([Fig. 49.3](#page-1-2)). It is uncertain whether this results

from increased waterborne transmission, or whether it is because it coincides with the peak period for malaria and malnutrition. A study from Malawi suggested that changes in incidence of iNTS were consequent upon changes in incidence of both malaria and, to a lesser extent, prevalence of malnutrition[,40](#page-5-22) and in a number of different settings in Africa a decline in the incidence of iNTS disease has been associated with a decline in malaria endemicity.[41–43](#page-5-23) The relationship between invasive disease, diarrheal disease, and stool carriage of NTS is poorly understood, and transmission routes are not well defined. In contrast to the well-known role of infected food/animals or contaminated food items in diarrheal *Salmonella* disease in industrialized countries, studies have failed to identify a major animal, food, or environmental reservoir of NTS in Africa, and person-toperson spread may play a relatively greater role in transmission[.44](#page-5-24) The conditions in many hospitals in tropical Africa may also support nosocomial transmission, especially in the emergence of drug-resistant NTS[.45](#page-5-25)

# **NATURAL HISTORY, PATHOGENESIS, AND PATHOLOGY**

# **Diarrheal Disease**

Diarrheal disease caused by NTS in immunocompetent individuals is characterized by inflammatory mucosal disease, with inflammatory infiltrates in the lamina propria of the ileum and colon, and crypt abscess formation (enterocolitis). A lack of colonic crypt architectural disturbance may be helpful in distinguishing infective colitis from idiopathic inflammatory bowel disease on biopsy. Asymptomatic carriage in the stool may continue for several months. Antibiotic treatment is known to increase the rate and duration of carriage in the stool after an episode of *Salmonella* diarrhea.

# **Invasive Disease**

NTS causing invasive disease likely invade through the small bowel mucosa, causing a primary bacteremia. Because many patients do not report gastrointestinal symptoms, such as pain or diarrhea, this may occur without overt inflammation. The lack of inflammation and diarrhea in HIV-infected patients may be because of a loss of mucosal Th17 T cells, leading to a lack of recruitment of neutrophils.[46](#page-6-0) By the time patients present with fever, they usually already have an established disseminated intracellular infection with replication in the bone marrow and reticuloendothelial system, as well as bacteremia [\(Fig. 49.4](#page-2-0))[.47,48](#page-6-1) This may be the explanation for the high rate of recrudescence, even after antibiotic treatment, and this is supported by genomic studies of recurrent iNTS disease, which revealed the majority of recurrence isolates are indistinguishable from the index case.[49](#page-6-2) Although the pathogenesis of iNTS is reminiscent of that of enteric fever, classic complications of enteric fever such as small bowel perforation and hemorrhage are not usually seen in iNTS disease.

Malaria contributes to reduction of gut mucosal resistance to NTS, particularly the gut epithelial layer. Malaria parasite sequestration to the gut is common in human[s50](#page-6-3) and appears to contribute to gut epithelial damage, evidenced by increased levels of intestinal fatty acid binding protein (IFABP), a biomarker of intestinal barrier ischemia,[51](#page-6-4) which may promote microbial translocation, including NTS, from the gut to the bloodstream.[52,53](#page-6-5)

# **Microbiology**

*Salmonella* is a genus of motile, facultative anaerobic gram-negative bacilli and a member of the Enterobacteriaceae family. Definitive diagnosis of iNTS disease is by blood culture, and of diarrheal NTS disease by stool culture. There are two species, *S. enterica* and *S. bongori,* and the vast majority of human disease is due to serovars of *S. enterica,* which has six subspecies. Human isolates usually fall within the subspecies *enterica.* A serologic method of typing devised by Kaufman and White, based on LPS somatic cell wall O antigens, envelope antigens (e.g., Vi antigen), and phase 1 and phase 2 flagellar H antigens enables differentiation of *Salmonella* into serovars, designated with names describing clinical syndromes (e.g., Choleraesuis, Typhimurium, Enteritidis), or the place where the organism was described (e.g., Dublin, Newport). To distinguish serovars from species and sub-species, they are notated in non-italicized text with a capital letter (e.g., *Salmonella enterica* subsp. *enterica* serovar Typhimurium, which is usually shortened to *S.* Typhimurium).

Among human isolates, *Salmonella* Typhi and Paratyphi A are considered "typhoidal" and cause a human-restricted illness called *enteric fever*. All other serovars, which have a wider vertebrate host range, are considered "non-typhoid Salmonellae," or NTS.

The vast majority of diarrheal illness is caused by only a few serovars, with *S.* Enteritidis, *S.* Typhimurium, *S.* Virchow, *S.* Newport, *S.* Hadar, *S.* Heidelberg, *S.* Agona, and *S.* Indiana being the most common globally, although there are much less data from the tropics.

Invasive *Salmonella* disease in the industrialized world is also caused by *S.* Enteritidis and *S.* Typhimurium; however, other serovars are associated with an invasive disease, typically but not exclusively, *S.* Cholerasuis, *S.* Virchow, and *S.* Dublin. Invasive disease in tropical settings is most commonly caused by *S.* Typhimurium and *S.* Enteritidis. Novel clades of these serovars have been described in SSA, variants of *S.* Typhimurium, which are of multi-locus sequence type ST313, and two variants of *S.* Enteritidis that are geographically restricted to West and Central and Eastern Africa, respectively. These clades have lost the genes required for an enteric lifestyle, similar to that seen in *S.* Typhi, novel prophage repertoires, and MDR virulence plasmids, and the genotypes and more recent phenotypic work raise the possibility of recent evolution toward a more human-adapted invasive lifestyle.[48,54,55](#page-6-6)

Antibiotic resistance is an emerging problem among *Salmonella* worldwide, including among clades associated with iNTS disease. Plasmid-borne MDR to chloramphenicol, cotrimoxazole, and ampicillin is now documented from many sites in Africa. Resistance to fluoroquinolones and cephalosporins is rapidly emerging and has been described in Mali, Democratic Republic of the Congo, Kenya, and Malawi[.56](#page-6-7)

# **CLINICAL FEATURES**

# **Diarrheal NTS Disease**

NTS enterocolitis presents with abdominal cramps, nausea and vomiting, and watery diarrhea, which may also be bloody in severe cases. Patients may be febrile, and 1% to 4% of adults have a transient bacteremia, which may lead to focal or metastatic infection,

particularly in elderly patients. In severe cases, enterocolitis may be accompanied by shock related to dehydration or to associated sepsis. Diarrheal illness usually lasts 2 to 5 days, resolving spontaneously. Complications, including toxic colonic dilatation and perforation, may be heralded by a prolonged disease course, severe pain, abdominal tenderness, and signs of peritonitis or shock. Diarrheal disease may be followed by seronegative reactive arthritis or Reiter's syndrome.

# **iNTS Disease**

The usual presentation of iNTS is a non-specific febrile illness, and the frequency of common presenting clinical features is shown in [Table 49.1](#page-3-0). As these data show, the clinical picture is heterogeneous, and there may be no obvious clinical focus. Diarrhea is often absent. The clinical picture may be complicated by co-infections—especially in HIV-infected patients—including respiratory, such as tuberculosis (TB)*, S. pneumoniae,* or *Klebsiella* spp. A concurrent respiratory infection may cause a simultaneous intravascular gram-negative sepsis to be overlooked[.19](#page-5-13) In young children especially, there is clinical overlap with the presentation of pneumonia, severe malaria, and anemia.[57](#page-6-8) This means that clinical diagnosis is especially difficult in the resource-limited setting and that empiric antibiotic treatment must have broad coverage (see later). Mortality associated with an index event of iNTS disease is high (25%–50%), even in microbiologically confirmed cases with appropriate antibiotic treatment[.19,25,27,38,56,58](#page-5-13)

In adults, iNTS disease generally presents during stage 4 HIV disease and 80% of ART-naïve patients at index presentation have a CD4 count of below 200 cells/µl. Features of advanced HIV disease may be present. Other causes of immunosuppression should be sought in the absence of HIV in adults.

# **Recurrent iNTS Disease**

Recurrence of NTS bacteremia occurs in 30% to 40% of HIVinfected ART-naïve survivors, even after 2 weeks of antibiotic treatment. Relapse is typically seen after 2 to 6 weeks and represents a recrudescence with the same index isolate. The number of viable bacteria is higher in bone marrow at relapse compared with the first presentation, suggesting an established intracellular niche. Re-treatment with antibiotics is not always successful, and 25% of patients with one recurrence go on to have multiple recurrences.[38](#page-5-26) If ART is available, successful immune reconstitution appears to greatly reduce the risk of iNTS recurrence.

# **Focal and Suppurative NTS Disease**

*Salmonella* has a capacity to cause focal suppurative disease.[59](#page-6-9) This is a problem in the elderly, in young children with diarrheal disease and transient bacteremia, in immunosuppressed patients, and in children with invasive NTS infection. There is a particular predilection to cause osteomyelitis and pyogenic arthritis, particularly in sickle cell disease. Intravascular infections at structurally damaged sites, such as atheroma, aneurysms, or damaged heart valves, cause persistent bacteremia, usually require combined surgical and medical therapy, and have a poor outcome. Focal infections during HIV are also described in the chest (empyema and, rarely, primary pneumonia), renal tract, genital tract, and hepatobiliary tract.[39](#page-5-21)

NTS meningitis in adults and children in Africa has a very poor outcome (60% mortality among children, 80% mortality among adults)[,16](#page-5-27) and subdural or epidural empyema are also described. Of particular note in the tropics is a phenomenon where active schistosomiasis is associated with persistent or recurrent NTS bacteremia among children, despite antibiotic treatment. This occurs because the bacterium is able to adhere to the adult helminth's tegument using a bacterial pilus, providing it with a sanctuary where it can evade antimicrobial treatment. Treatment with praziquantel kills the adult helminth and allows effective antibiotic eradication of the *Salmonella* with prompt resolution of fever.[60](#page-6-10)

# **PATIENT EVALUATION, DIAGNOSIS, AND DIFFERENTIAL DIAGNOSIS**

The two most common clinical syndromes arising from NTS are enterocolitis with diarrheal disease or invasive disease with sepsis. In resource-limited settings it is usually necessary to take a syndromic approach to evaluating these two modes of presentation.

# **Diarrheal Disease**

Acute febrile diarrheal disease is usually presumed to be infective unless specific features suggest other diagnoses or complications. Evaluation should include assessment of history, duration, fever, pain, shock, dehydration, urine output, and careful examination of the abdomen. The abdominal pain may be severe, and the clinical picture may resemble one of appendicitis. Simple stool microscopy may show polymorphic inflammatory cells. Stool may be positive for occult or occasionally frank blood, but this is not diagnostically helpful. Plain abdominal film or sigmoidoscopy is necessary only if toxic dilatation, other complications, or alternative diagnoses are suspected.

# **Invasive Disease**

The non-specific clinical features seen in iNTS disease (see [Table](#page-3-0) [49.1](#page-3-0)), limited access to laboratory and microbiology facilities, and the emergence of MDR make it a challenging illness to diagnose and manage in resource-limited settings. Although definitive diagnosis of iNTS is by blood culture, these facilities are not widely available in SSA. Therefore an empiric approach to diagnosis and management is often necessary.

An approach often used among children is to "rule out" malaria through blood film or malaria antigen card test. However, because of the association of pediatric malaria with iNTS, malaria does not rule out iNTS or other co-infections, particularly if diagnosed using a rapid-diagnostic antigen test, which may remain positive after acute parasitemia has resolved. Differential diagnosis of patients presenting in the tropics with fever as their primary complaint must include malaria, TB, and pneumococcal sepsis in addition to iNTS. Among adults, HIV testing and staging are essential, and presentation with iNTS defines stage 4 HIV disease. Given the strong association of iNTS with advanced HIV disease, co-infection with any, and all, of these pathogens must also be considered. Presentation with NTS bacteremia and concomitant pneumonia caused by a second pathogen is particularly diagnostically challenging among both adults and children. Many children with iNTS also meet the World Health Organization (WHO) case definition for acute lower respiratory tract infection (LRTI), and empiric treatment for pneumonia may not cover iNTS disease.[26](#page-5-28)

In a study of clinical predictors of bloodstream pathogens among febrile admissions in Africa, splenomegaly with high fever (>39°C) conferred a high independent odds ratio (4.9) for NTS bacteremia. Surprisingly, splenomegaly did not predict malaria or TB. Splenomegaly may therefore be a useful clinical marker of iNTS disease in adults in an HIV-prevalent setting[,61](#page-6-11) but it is only found in 30% to 40% of cases.

# **TREATMENT**

# **Diarrheal Disease**

Management of enterocolitis caused by NTS should be supportive; antibiotic treatment is not indicated except in severe or complicated adult cases or in young children or immunocompromised adults. In cases of dysentery (grossly bloody diarrhea), where an etiologic agent is not sought or identified, empiric antibiotic therapy should be directed against *Shigella* species, which are more common causes of dysentery and also derive a clear benefit from treatment. In contrast, antibiotics do not reduce the duration of diarrheal illness caused by NTS, and they prolong stool shedding and increase the risk of side effects from treatment itself (evidence grade 1).

# **Invasive Disease**

The choice of empiric therapy for febrile patients requiring hospital admission in an HIV-endemic area is difficult. Reliance on penicillin and chloramphenicol, even if respiratory features are prominent, would most likely fail to treat *Salmonella*, due to intrinsic resistance to penicillin and widespread resistance to chloramphenicol, ampicillin, and cotrimoxazole. Broader-spectrum coverage (see later) may be considered necessary and judged according to known local antimicrobial resistance patterns and local availability of antimicrobials. If an antibiotic or combination of antibiotics inactive against NTS fails to cause defervescence and clinical improvement in febrile patients after 48 hours, consideration should be given to changing to a regimen with likely activity against NTS.

Antibiotics that may be available and are likely to be effective against NTS include third-generation cephalosporins (such as ceftriaxone), fluoroquinolones (such as ciprofloxacin), and the macrolide azithromycin, except perhaps in Kenya, where resistance to cephalosporins and fluoroquinolones exceeded 50% in one study.[62](#page-6-12) However, there have been no clinical trials for iNTS disease to provide guidance. Fluoroquinolones probably offer superior intracellular penetration and reduce the risk of recurrence (evidence grade 4), but the risks of using fluoroquinolones include partial treatment of disseminated TB, which may obscure the diagnosis and generate drug resistance. Short courses of fluoroquinolones, as are used in typhoid fever, should be avoided in iNTS because of the high rate of recurrence seen in this disease. If a microbiologic diagnosis of iNTS is confirmed, then a course of 14 days of an effective antimicrobial should be used with rapid initiation of antiretroviral therapy for HIV if appropriate.

Failure to improve on an effective agent should lead the clinician to consider TB as an alternative or additional diagnosis. However, in some cases of iNTS, even in the setting of appropriate therapy, resolution of fever may take several days. A clinical search should also be made for focal suppurative complications. Prolonged antibiotic treatment for at least 6 to 8 weeks is required for focal sepsis, along with drainage of any pus collection. Needle aspiration of infected large joints is an acceptable first step, but formal surgical drainage may be necessary if there is a poor response (evidence grade 2). Joints should not be immobilized during treatment, but rather movement allowed as pain permits. Outcomes for septic arthritis can be excellent if well managed. Our experience of NTS empyema is that prolonged chest drainage is required, along with antibiotic treatment, but results were disappointing. Treatment of infected heart valves and vascular structures frequently requires a combination of surgical and prolonged antibiotic treatment, and outcomes after mycotic aneurysm infection are especially poor. Treatment with praziquantel to eradicate possible live schistosomal helminths in endemic areas is safe and may be helpful (evidence grade 4).

# **Prevention of Recurrence**

iNTS disease frequently recrudesces from an intracellular site of persistence in HIV-positive adults.[19,23,38,47](#page-5-13) Although prolonged courses of fluoroquinolones (i.e., 4–6 weeks of ciprofloxacin) have been suggested for treatment and secondary prevention in guidelines from industrialized countries (evidence grade 5), this is based on expert opinion in settings with low prevalence of TB and in the pre-ART era. Prolonged therapy has not been subject to clinical trials or cost–benefit analysis, and its impact on broader antimicrobial resistance has not yet been assessed. This is particularly important, as fluoroquinolones are a mainstay of treatment for MDR TB.

The impact of ART and cotrimoxazole preventive therapy on preventing recurrence in HIV-infected adults and children is undocumented, but our experience suggests that initiation of ARTs reduces recrudescence. However, as recrudescence is often early, resistance to cotrimoxazole and logistical difficulties in early initiation of antiretrovirals (ARVs) may reduce the impact of these interventions, and immediate initiation of ARVs may be important. Clinical trials of strategies to prevent recurrence without compromising antimicrobial efficacy are urgently needed. As there are no satisfactory evidence-based options for prevention, expectant management with retreatment of iNTS with an effective agent as it recurs remains essential (evidence grade 5).

# **VACCINATION**

There is currently no vaccine for iNTS, although several are in pre-clinical development. Antibody is likely to be protective, and a deficiency of antibody against LPS has been shown in susceptible African children[.8](#page-5-5) Among some HIV-infected adults, however, the observation has been made that there is an excess of inhibitory anti-*Salmonella* antibodies directed against LPS that compete with bactericidal antibodies. This raises the possibility that a vaccine directed against LPS might conceivably do harm in HIV-infected individuals, so a vaccine directed against LPS might be most appropriate in children. *Salmonella* membrane preparations, outer membrane proteins, or other targets such as flagellin could be more appropriate, and strategies are also under pre-clinical development.[63](#page-6-13)
