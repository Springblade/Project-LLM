# **137.3** Fish Capable of Inflicting Serious Trauma

*David A. Warrell*

### KEY FEATURES

- • Shark attacks can be devastating but only 70 to 100 occur each year with 5 to 15 fatalities. Florida, Australia, and South Africa have the highest risk.
- • Attacks are best prevented by taking local advice to avoid high-risk locations, circumstances, and behavior.
- • Medical problems include extensive trauma, hemorrhagic shock, and a high risk of bacterial contamination by unusual marine pathogens.
- • First aid involves securing the victim from drowning, resuscitation, control of bleeding and perforating injuries, intravenous fluid replacement, and rapid evacuation to a hospital for emergency surgery and treatment of infection.
- • Other fish capable of causing severe and fatal trauma include barracuda, moray eels, needle fish, stingrays, piranhas, and candiru.

## **SHARKS**

Sharks are most common in oceans between latitudes 47°S and 46°N, especially where water temperature is above 20°C. There are usually about 70 to 100 shark attacks with 5 to 15 (average 9) fatalities each year (case fatality ≈8%). However, in 2016, there were only 84 attacks with 4 deaths (case fatality 4.9%) in Australia and New Caledonia. Most attacks are in North American (especially Florida), Australian, and South African waters.[1](#page-3-0) Great white (*Carcharodon carcharias*) (length ≈16 m, weight 2250 kg), tiger (*Galeocerdo cuvier*) (5.5 m, 900 kg) (Fig. [137.3.1A–E](#page-0-0)), and bull (*Carcharhinus leucas*) (3.5 m, 360 kg) sharks are the most dangerous, but attacks have been reported by 32 species; all 70 species exceeding 2 m in length are potentially lethal. Devastating deep wounds, especially of buttocks, thighs, or shoulders, result in massive bleeding from severed arteries causing shock and the risk of drowning. Shark wounds are characterized by sharp incisions without abrasions, serrated edges, a triangular or rectangular flap of skin, regular spacing corresponding to the shark's teeth, gouge marks on the bones, and severing of body parts at the joints without fractures [\(Fig. 137.3.2A–C](#page-1-0))[.2](#page-3-1) Bumping or rubbing against shark

#### **MANAGEMENT**

Vascular injury is a major determinant of mortality. Immediate medical care involves resuscitation (control of hemorrhage, fluid replacement, and treatment of hypothermia), washout, debridement, and follow-up for prevention of infection and closure of more complex wounds.[3–5](#page-3-2) A study of shark wounds in Recife, Brazil, discovered 81 bacterial pathogens, mainly *Enterobacteriaceae,* all of which were covered by gentamicin, vancomycin, and levofloxacin.[6](#page-3-3) The wide variety of bacteria cultured from shark bite wounds include *Vibrio* spp., including *V. alginolyticus, V. carchariae,* and *V. parahaemolyticus; Photobacterium (Vibrio) damsel; Aeromonas* spp., including *A. caviae* and *A. hydrophila; Pasteurella* spp.; coagulase positive and negative *Staphylococcus* spp.; and *Bacillus* spp. Recommended empirical antibiotics include third-generation cephalosporin, ciprofloxacin, imipenem, aminoglycosides, metronidazole, fluoroquinolone, or doxycycline.

## **PREVENTION**

Take local advice. Most attacks occur between 6:00 AM and 8:00 PM, but sharks come closer to the shore and are most active in twilight or darkness. Avoid bathing between sandbars and the ocean, far out to sea, where dead fish or sewage are being discharged, and where flocks of birds are feeding. Do not bathe if you are injured, bleeding, wearing jewelry or brightly patterned or colored clothes, or with a pet dog. Surfers and surface swimmers are targeted more often than divers. Reduce risk by bathing in groups, close to the shore, and only in daylight. If attacked by a shark, fight back—hit it repeatedly on the nose and claw at its eyes and gills and try to get out of the water. Chemical and electrical-field repellents and chainmail protective suits have been developed.

## **OTHER DANGEROUS FISH[4](#page-3-4)**

Most fish can inflict a painful and damaging bite, susceptible to infection, if handled carelessly on a line or in a net, but the following deserve special mention.

#### **Barracudas**

The great barracuda (*Sphyraena barracuda*) of the tropical Atlantic can grow to almost 2 meters in length. Its powerful jaws and numerous long, razor-sharp, fanglike teeth can sever a digit or even a hand. Hands and ankles may be bitten when a landed fish is thrashing about still on the line or while the hook is being disengaged. Barracudas are attracted by shining objects, such as rings and bracelets on hands dangled in the water and may leap out of the water in pursuit of a fish that is being pulled in on an angler's line.

#### **Moray Eels (Muraenidae)**

The giant moray (*Gymnothorax javanicus*) can reach a length of 3 meters and a weight of 36 kilograms; the Californian moray (*G. mordax*) reaches 1.5 meters in length (see Fig. 139.1.2). Moray eels may be encountered by divers exploring coral reefs and wrecks. Attacks are unusual, but the eel's multiple rows of long, fanglike, backward-pointing teeth may cause deep puncture wounds with avulsion of tissue if the animal is forcefully removed [\(Fig. 137.3.3](#page-2-0)). Despite much speculation, they have no venom apparatus, but a major threat is infection of the bite wounds with a variety of marine *Vibrio, Aeromonas,* and *Pseudomonas* spp.[7](#page--1-0)

## **Needle Fish (Garfish) (***Tylosurus* **spp.) (Belonidae) ([Fig. 137.3.4A and B\)](#page-2-1)**

These Indo-Pacific fish can leap out of the sea at speeds of 60 km/h, attracted by light. They have impaled fishermen and, rarely, surfers and divers, sometimes causing fatal injuries ([Fig. 137.3.4C–E\)](#page-2-1).[8–10](#page--1-1)

## **Stingrays (Dasyatidae)**

Stingrays can inflict fatal penetrating trauma with their spines (see later).

#### **Piranhas (Pirañas) (Characidae) ([Fig. 137.3.5A\)](#page-3-5)**

These ferocious fish of the Amazon, Orinoco, and other South American river systems are alleged to have stripped unwary swimmers to the bone (Fig. [137.3.5B\)](#page-3-5). Such mass attacks on people or animals have rarely been reported, but piranhas' sharp teeth can bite out chunks of flesh (Fig. [137.3.5C](#page-3-5)).

**Fig. 137.3.6** Candiru (*Vandellia cirrhosa*), Brazil (© David A. Warrell).

## <span id="page-3-6"></span>**Candiru (Vampire, Toothpick, or Penis Fish) (***Vandellia cirrhosa***) (Trichomycteridae)**

In the Amazon region, these tiny parasitic catfish (Portuguese "candirú," Spanish "canero") ([Fig. 137.3.6](#page-3-6)) are feared more than piranhas. Normally, they attach to the gills of large fish and feed off their blood, but these fish are apparently also attracted to bathers by detecting urine or blood. Once they have burrowed into the urethra, vagina, or anus (especially in menstruating women), they erect spines on their gill covers, which prevents removal. One hospital in Puerto Maldonado, Peru, admits more than 10 cases each year. Although several herbal concoctions are said to promote their elimination, surgery or cystoscopy is usually necessary[.11,12](#page--1-2)

## **MANAGEMENT OF INJURIES BY OTHER DANGEROUS FISH**

The same principles apply as with shark bites, although trauma is usually on a much smaller scale. Infection with aquatic microorganisms sometimes leading to necrotizing fasciitis or myositis is a serious problem, especially in immunocompromised people; in salt water these include *Fusarium solani, Vibrio vulnificus, V. parahaemolyticus, V. alginolyticus, Erysipelothrix rhusiopathiae* (causing erysipeloid "seal finger" and "whale finger"), *Plesiomonas shigelloides, Acinetobacter* spp., *Chromobacterium violaceum, Flavobacterium* spp.*, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Mycobacterium marinum, Prototheca* spp., and *Staphylococcus aureus* (off populous beaches such as Waikiki, Honolulu); and in freshwater these include *Aeromonas hydrophila* and free-living amebae.

In cases of severe, extensive injuries, especially if there has been delay in presentation, empirical antibiotic treatment is appropriate with oral doxycycline or fluoroquinolone or parenteral tetracycline and an aminoglycoside combined with either cefotaxime or a fluoroquinolone. Results of cultures will direct specific therapy.
