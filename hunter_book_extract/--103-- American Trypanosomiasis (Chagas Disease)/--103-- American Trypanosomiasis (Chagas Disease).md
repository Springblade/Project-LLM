# **103** American Trypanosomiasis (Chagas Disease)

*Rogelio López-Vélez, Francesca F. Norman, Caryn Bern*

# KEY FEATURES

- • Caused by *Trypanosoma cruzi,* a flagellated protozoan parasite of the order Kinetoplastida, family Trypanosomatidae.
- • Endemic in the Americas from Mexico to northern Argentina and Chile. Twenty-eight million people are at risk; it is estimated that 6 million people are currently infected. 38,600 new infections and 10,600 deaths are estimated to occur annually.
- • The southern half of the United States has enzootic vector-borne transmission and rare autochthonous human cases.
- • Due to migration, chronic Chagas disease is now seen in North America, Europe (particularly Spain), Australia, and Japan; acute Chagas disease has rarely been reported in travelers returning from endemic countries.
- • Transmitted by hematophagous triatomine vectors (Hemiptera, Reduviidae, Triatominae); more than 100 species of mammals act as reservoirs.
- • *T. cruzi* can also be transmitted congenitally, by blood transfusion or organ donation, and via contaminated food or drink.
- • Factors that may affect pathogenesis include parasite burden, the severity of the initial infection, host immune response, and human genetic factors. Tissue inflammation may be caused directly by the parasite as well as secondary to the host's immune response.
- • The natural history includes the acute phase, lasting 2 to 3 months, and the chronic phase, which lasts the lifetime of the host. An estimated 20% to 30% of people who initially have the indeterminate (asymptomatic) form progress over a period of years to clinically evident cardiac and/or gastrointestinal disease.
- • Severe and fatal cases of *T. cruzi* infection after organ, tissue, or cell transplantation and HIV co-infection can occur.
- • Diagnosis of acute and early congenital *T. cruzi* infection requires demonstration of the parasite in blood by microscopy, polymerase chain reaction (PCR), or hemoculture. Diagnosis of chronic infection relies on serologic tests (e.g., enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay [ELISA]) to detect immunoglobulin G (IgG) antibodies to *T. cruzi.*
- • Indication for anti-parasitic therapy depends on the phase of the disease and the clinical status and age of the patient. There are currently only two available drugs: benznidazole and nifurtimox.
- • Prevention and control rely on residual application of long-lasting insecticides in human dwellings and peridomestic structures, as well as serologic screening of blood donors, pregnant women, and the children of women found to be infected.

#### **INTRODUCTION**

Chagas disease is a zoonotic protozoan infection transmitted by hematophagous triatomine bugs (Hemiptera, Reduviidae, Triatominae), a subfamily of the reduviid bugs [\(http://www.cdc.gov/](http://www.cdc.gov/parasites/chagas/gen_info/vectors/index.html) [parasites/chagas/gen\\_info/vectors/index.html\)](http://www.cdc.gov/parasites/chagas/gen_info/vectors/index.html). In Latin America, Chagas disease affects millions and is one of the leading causes of cardiomyopathy with high morbidity and mortality rates[.1](#page-11-0)

Due to efforts undertaken to control the vector and secure the blood supply, the incidence and prevalence have decreased considerably since the 1990s. However, imported Chagas disease is increasingly recognized as an emerging problem in the United States and Europe as a result of immigration from Latin America. Clinicians in non-endemic areas may therefore face migrants with symptomatic or asymptomatic *T. cruzi* infection, as well as acute infections transmitted congenitally, through organ donation or blood transfusions. Chagas disease is considered a neglected tropical disease, characterized by an urgent need for new tools for screening, treatment, and test of cure.

### **EPIDEMIOLOGY**

## **Vector-Borne Transmission, Vectors, and Non-Human Reservoir Hosts**

*Trypanosoma cruzi* is carried in the gut of the triatomine bug; transmission occurs when infected bug feces are inoculated through the bite wound or intact mucous membranes.[2](#page-11-1) Vector-borne transmission occurs exclusively in the Americas and remains the predominant mechanism for new human infections.

Triatomines of both sexes must take blood meals to develop through their nymphal stages to adults; females require a blood meal to lay eggs. Thus nymphs and adults of either sex may be infected with *T. cruzi,* but infection rates increase with increasing vector stage and age. There are at least 130 triatomine species in the Americas; a handful of highly domiciliated vector species are of disproportionate importance in the human epidemiology of disease.[3](#page-11-2) These include *Triatoma infestans* in the Southern Cone (Argentina, Bolivia, Chile, Paraguay, southern Peru, Uruguay, and southern Brazil), *Rhodnius prolixus* and *T. dimidiata* in northern South America and Central America, and *Panstrongylus megistus* and *T. brasiliensis* in Brazil. Most domesticated species feed nocturnally and are able to complete their blood meal without waking the host. The major Latin American vectors defecate during, or immediately after taking, a blood meal, increasing the likelihood of infecting the host. Some triatomine species can infest both domestic and sylvatic sites and may play a bridging role.

More than 100 species of mammals have been reported to have natural infections with *T. cruzi.* Sylvatic transmission cycles are maintained by wild mammals and triatomine species; the vectors often colonize nests of rodent or marsupial reservoir hosts. Wild triatomine adults may fly into human dwellings, attracted by light, and cause sporadic human infections. Domestic transmission cycles occur where vectors are adapted to living in human houses and nearby animal enclosures. The peridomestic environment provides abundant hosts that act as blood meal sources, and poor-quality housing provides crevices and other diurnal hiding places for triatomines. In endemic communities, a high proportion of houses may be infested, and a house and its immediate surroundings may support large colonies of bugs. Dogs, cats, and guinea pigs act as important domestic *T. cruzi* reservoir hosts, and opossums, rodents, armadillos, and raccoons are important sylvatic hosts.

#### **Non-Vectorial** *Trypanosoma cruzi* **Transmission**

*T. cruzi* can also be transmitted congenitally, by blood transfusion or organ donation, and via contaminated food or drink. An estimated 5% to 6% (range 1%–10%) of infants of infected mothers are born with congenital *T. cruzi* infection.[4](#page-11-3) Factors reported to increase risk include higher maternal parasitemia level, less robust maternal anti–*T. cruzi* immune responses, HIV, and, in an animal model, parasite strain. The risk of *T. cruzi* transmission per infected unit transfused is estimated to be 1.7%[.5](#page-11-4) Risk from platelet transfusions was estimated at 13.3%, substantially higher than for other components, such as packed red cells.[6](#page-11-5) Uninfected recipients who receive an organ from a *T. cruzi*–infected donor may develop acute *T. cruzi* infection; transmission is not universal and varies depending on the organ transplanted and degree of immunosuppression.[7](#page-11-6) In a series of 16 uninfected recipients of kidneys from infected donors, only 3 (19%) acquired *T. cruzi* infection; cardiac transplantation is thought to pose a much higher risk. Twenty instances of transmission by organ transplantation have been documented in the literature to date (12 kidney, 1 kidney and pancreas, 3 liver, 1 bilateral lung, 3 heart).[7,8](#page-11-6) Recently, increasing attention has focused on the oral route of *T. cruzi* transmission, with several outbreaks attributed to contaminated fruit or sugar cane juice reported from Brazil and Venezuela[.9,10](#page-12-0)

#### **Geographic Distribution and Disease Burden**

Historically, Chagas disease primarily affected rural Latin America.[2,11](#page-11-1) In settings with endemic vector-borne transmission, *T. cruzi* infection is usually acquired in childhood. Because the infection is lifelong, the seroprevalence in an area with sustained vector-borne transmission rises with age and may reach high levels in adulthood, reflecting cumulative incidence. The country with the highest estimated prevalence of *T. cruzi* infection is Bolivia, where many endemic rural communities have adult infection prevalences >20%, followed by Argentina, El Salvador, and Honduras. However, vector-borne transmission occurred historically throughout the Americas from the southern United States to Chile and Argentina[.2](#page-11-1) Because cardiac and gastrointestinal manifestations usually begin in early adulthood and progress over a period of years (to decades), the prevalence of symptomatic clinical disease increases with increasing age.

Several Chagas disease control initiatives have made major advances in decreasing house infestation and ensuring *T. cruzi* screening of blood supplies[.11,12](#page-12-1) As a consequence, the estimated global prevalence of Chagas disease has fallen from 18 million in 1991 to 6 million in 2010.[13](#page-12-2) A total of 38,600 new infections and 10,600 deaths are estimated to occur annually.[13,14](#page-12-2) At the same time, migration has brought infected individuals to cities both within and outside of Latin America. The disease burden outside of Latin America includes an estimated 42,000 *T. cruzi*–infected immigrants in Spai[n15](#page-12-3) and tens of thousands in Italy, France, and Switzerland[.16](#page-12-4) Immigrants with Chagas disease are also known to be living in Japan, Australia, and Canada **(**Fig. [103.1](#page-1-0)).

The southern half of the United States contains established enzootic cycles of *T. cruzi,* involving 11 triatomine vector species and multiple mammalian hosts, such as rodents, raccoons, opossums, and domestic dogs.[17](#page-12-5) A total of seven locally acquired vector-borne *T. cruzi* infections have been documented in the United States since the 1950s, but most are presumed to go undetected[.12](#page-12-6) Nevertheless, the number of autochthonous *T. cruzi* infections is dwarfed by the estimated 300,000 infected immigrants from endemic areas of Latin America[.18](#page-12-7)

#### **Control and Prevention**

Application of long-lasting insecticides in human dwellings and peridomestic structures is effective against domestic triatomine vectors but must be followed by monitoring for re-infestation[.11](#page-12-1) Between 1991 and 2004, four sub-regional control programs were established. The major aims are to control transmission by domestic vectors through house spraying programs and to prevent bloodborne *T. cruzi* transmission by establishing blood donation screening. Programs to address congenital *T. cruzi* infection were subsequently added in several countries.

The Southern Cone Initiative, the first program to be established, has resulted in the certification of elimination of domestic transmission by *T. infestans* in Chile (1999), Uruguay (1997), and Brazil (2006), plus several departments/provinces of Argentina and Paraguay[.12](#page-12-6) The success of the Southern Cone Initiative inspired the subsequent establishment of initiatives in Central America, the Amazon, and Andean countries. Domestic *T. cruzi* transmission by *R. prolixus* was certified as interrupted in Central America in 2010.

Serologic screening of blood components for *T. cruzi* is now compulsory in all endemic countries in the region, and the prevalence of infection in screened donors has decreased substantially[.19](#page-12-8) Nevertheless, Chagas disease screening coverage by country was estimated to vary from 25% to 100% in 2002, and the risk of transmission through blood transfusion, though much decreased, has not been eliminated. The residual risk in Latin America where screening has been implemented is estimated to be 1:200,000 units.

Congenital Chagas disease screening programs usually rely on prenatal serologic screening followed by microscopic examination of concentrated cord blood from infants of seropositive mothers[.4](#page-11-3) Conventional immunoglobulin G (IgG) serology is recommended after 9 months of age for infants with negative screening tests at birth. These programs have been challenged by suboptimal sensitivity of cord blood screening and high loss to follow-up later in infancy[.20](#page-12-9)

Surveys of sentinel populations, usually children younger than 5 years of age or new military recruits, are used to monitor the impact of control initiatives: steep declines in *T. cruzi* infection prevalence have been documented in many Latin American countries[.13](#page-12-2) However, focal vector-borne transmission continues in most endemic countries of Latin America, and the success of the Southern Cone Initiative is now challenged by re-infestation from residual vector colonies and the development of insecticide resistance, especially in the Gran Chaco—a heavily infested ecologic zone shared by Argentina, Bolivia, and Paraguay.

## **NATURAL HISTORY AND PATHOGENESIS**

# **Life Cycle**

*T. cruzi* is a flagellate protozoan parasite of the order Kinetoplastida, family Trypanosomatidae, which passes part of the life cycle in the triatomine vector and part in the human or non-human mammalian host.In the mammalian host (Fig. [103.2\)](#page-2-0),infective trypomastigotes circulate in the bloodstream and intracellular dividing amastigotes are found in tissues. Triatomine vectors are infected by ingestion

![](_page_2_Figure_11.jpeg)

<span id="page-2-0"></span>**Fig. 103.2** Life cycle of *Trypanosoma cruzi.*

of circulating trypomastigotes in a blood meal. In the triatomine midgut, trypomastigotes transform into epimastigotes, which replicate by binary fission. Daughter epimastigotes migrate to the vector hindgut and differentiate into metacyclic trypomastigotes. Infective metacyclic trypomastigotes are excreted during defecation and enter the mammalian host by penetrating the bite wound or other breaks in the skin, or through intact mucous membranes. Trypomastigotes circulate in blood, invade cells and differentiate into amastigotes which replicate, and then transform into trypomastigotes. Infected cells rupture and disseminate trypomastigotes into the circulation to invade adjacent cells and other tissues at distant sites via the bloodstream and lymphatics, with special affinity for muscle and ganglion cells (Fig. [103.3\)](#page-3-0).[2](#page-11-1)

#### **Pathogenesis and Pathology**

Both parasite and host factors are thought to influence the development of clinical manifestations and severity of disease after *T. cruzi* infection. The pathogenesis of Chagas disease is incompletely understood; possible factors that may alter chronic severity include the parasite burden and severity of the initial infection, re-infections, the host immune response, and human genetic factors. Distinct evolutionary lineages of the parasite (*T. cruzi* Discrete Typing Units [DTUs] I–VI) have been identified[.21](#page-12-10) Specific *T. cruzi* DTUs may be associated with different geographic distributions, transmission cycles, and susceptibility to trypanocidal drugs. The occurrence of the digestive form of Chagas disease principally in areas south of the Amazon basin is believed to be a result of differences in parasite strains.[22](#page-12-11) Multiple DTUs with different tissue tropism may coexist in the same patient, and the type detected in blood may not be the same as that found in tissue lesions. Some studies suggest that specific parasite DTUs may be more frequently associated with cardiac involvement,[23](#page-12-12) but this has been difficult to demonstrate. Parasite molecules such as cruzipain and transsialidases regulate adhesion and invasion of host cells and/or immune evasion; variations in expression of these molecules may influence the virulence of *T. cruzi.* Tissue damage appears to be caused mainly by direct parasite effects and the host's immune response.[2,24](#page-11-1)

During the acute phase of infection (usually corresponding to the first 2–3 months after infection), all types of nucleated cells may be infected and inflammatory changes are especially marked close to ruptured infected cells. Histopathology reveals localized inflammatory reactions, acute diffuse myocarditis with myocyte necrosis, interstitial edema, and inflammatory cell infiltrates[.25](#page-12-13)

Inflammatory foci may also be found in the smooth muscle of the esophagus and colon and the central and peripheral nervous systems.

In nearly all infected individuals, an effective host immune response, involving T helper-1, CD4<sup>+</sup> , and CD8<sup>+</sup> lymphocytes and the production of interferon-γ, tumor necrosis factor-α, and interleukin-12, develops within 60 days of infection—which controls the parasitemia. However, in the absence of effective treatment, tissue infection persists for the life of the host, and a failure to down-regulate the inflammatory response appears to play a role, especially in the pathogenesis of cardiomyopathy. In the indeterminate form of the chronic phase, isolated inflammatory foci may be found in tissues.

The parasite may be difficult to detect in the chronic phase, but there is consensus that parasite persistence is required for development of disease. At least four mechanisms are believed to be involved in the pathogenesis of chronic Chagas disease, including parasite-dependent injury, immune-mediated tissue damage, and neurogenic and microvascular changes.[26](#page-12-14) A positive correlation between parasite DNA in tissue lesions and disease progression and severity has been shown[.27](#page-12-15) A range of autoantibodies may be detected in patients with cardiomyopathy, although their role remains unclear and the "autoimmunity hypothesis" remains controversial.[26](#page-12-14) A low-level, ongoing myocarditis of all chambers leads to diffuse myocardial fibrosis, scarring of the conduction system, and reduction in cardiac fibers, often leading to dilated cardiomyopathy, sometimes accompanied by an apical aneurysm.

Gastrointestinal involvement in chronic Chagas disease is thought to be produced by destruction of autonomic ganglia in the gut walls, with unmasking as a result of age-related attrition of the remaining nerve cells and eventually leading to megaesophagus and/or megacolon.[28](#page-12-16)

#### **CLINICAL MANIFESTATIONS**

#### **Acute** *Trypanosoma cruzi* **Infection**

After vector-borne *T. cruzi* exposure, the incubation period is 1 to 2 weeks, after which the acute phase of infection begins.[2](#page-11-1) The acute phase lasts 8 to 12 weeks and is characterized by circulating trypomastigotes detectable by microscopy of fresh blood or buffy coat smears (see Fig. [103.3\)](#page-3-0). Most patients are asymptomatic or have mild, non-specific symptoms, such as fever, lymphadenopathy, and/or hepatosplenomegaly, and do not come to clinical attention during the acute phase. Some patients have inflammation and swelling at the site of inoculation, known as a *chagoma*. Chagomas

Inoculation via the conjunctiva leads to the characteristic unilateral swelling of the upper and lower eyelid known as the *Romaña sign* (Fig. [103.4](#page-4-1)). Severe acute disease occurs in less than 1% of patients; manifestations include acute myocarditis, pericardial effusion, and/or meningoencephalitis. Acute Chagas disease carries an estimated risk of mortality in the range of 1 in 200 to 1 in 400 cases, but this is difficult to estimate as the vast majority of infections are not detected in the acute phase[.2](#page-11-1) Orally transmitted *T. cruzi* infection appears to be associated with more severe acute morbidity and higher mortality than vector-borne infection. For example, 75% of 103 infected individuals in a 2007 outbreak in a Caracas school linked to contaminated fruit juice were symptomatic, 59% had electrocardiography (ECG) abnormalities, 20% were hospitalized, and there was one death from acute myocarditis[.12](#page-12-6)

#### **Chronic** *Trypanosoma cruzi* **Infection**

Eight to 12 weeks after infection, parasitemia levels become undetectable by microscopy and, in the absence of effective antitrypanosomal treatment, the individual passes into the chronic phase of *T. cruzi* infection. Despite the absence of microscopically detectable parasites in the peripheral blood, persons with chronic *T. cruzi* infection can transmit the parasite to the vector and directly to other humans through blood components, organ donation, and congenitally. Persons with chronic *T. cruzi* infection but without signs or symptoms of Chagas disease are considered to have the indeterminate or asymptomatic form. An estimated 20% to 30% of people who initially have the indeterminate form progress over a period of years (to decades) to clinically evident cardiac and/or gastrointestinal disease.[2](#page-11-1)

#### **Chagas Cardiomyopathy**

Chagas cardiomyopathy is characterized by chronic inflammation affecting all chambers of the heart, conduction system damage, and often an apical aneurysm (Fig. [103.5\)](#page-4-2).[29](#page-12-17) The first manifestations usually consist of right bundle branch block, left anterior fascicular block, and/or segmental left ventricular (LV) wall motion abnormalities ([Table 103.1\)](#page-4-3)[.2,30](#page-11-1) Later manifestations include complex ventricular extrasystoles and non-sustained and sustained ventricular tachycardia; sinus node dysfunction leading to severe bradycardia; a high degree of atrioventricular (AV) block; an apical aneurysm, usually in the left ventricle; emboli as a result of thrombus formation

Signs of impaired LV function, New York Heart Association functional class III or IV heart failure, cardiomegaly on chest x-ray, and/or non-sustained ventricular tachycardia on 24-hour ambulatory ECG monitoring indicate poor prognosis and high risk of mortality in the short term[.31](#page-12-18)

#### **Chagas Digestive Disease**

Gastrointestinal involvement is less common than Chagas heart disease. This form is more frequently seen in patients infected in the countries of the Southern Cone, and is rare in northern South America, Central America, and Mexico. The effects on the esophagus span a spectrum from asymptomatic motility disorders through mild achalasia to severe megaesophagus. Symptoms include dysphagia, odynophagia, esophageal reflux, weight loss, aspiration, cough, and regurgitation. As in idiopathic achalasia, the risk of esophageal carcinoma is elevated. Megacolon (Fig. [103.6](#page-5-0)) is characterized by prolonged constipation and may give rise to fecaloma, volvulus, and bowel ischemia.

#### **Congenital** *Trypanosoma cruzi* **infection**

Most infected newborns are asymptomatic or have subtle findings, but a minority presents with severe life-threatening disease[.4](#page-11-3) The manifestations of symptomatic congenital Chagas disease can include low birth weight, prematurity, low Apgar scores, hepatosplenomegaly, anemia, and thrombocytopenia. Severely affected neonates may have myocarditis, meningoencephalitis, gastrointestinal megasyndromes, anasarca, pneumonitis, and/or respiratory distress. In published studies from the 1990s and earlier, mortality among infected infants was significantly higher than in uninfected infants, ranging from <5% to 20%[.32](#page-12-19) However, even severe congenital Chagas disease may not be recognized, as signs are often non-specific or the diagnosis is not considered. More recent cohort studies have shown lower rates of severe congenital Chagas disease, and some investigators hypothesize that disease severity has decreased as a result of better vector control and decreasing maternal parasite exposure.

Acute *Trypanosoma cruzi* Infection in Organ Transplantation Recipients

Acute *T. cruzi* infection in organ recipients has several features that differ from acute *T. cruzi* infection in immunocompetent hosts.[7](#page-11-6) The incubation period can be prolonged over several months to more than 1 year. A relatively severe clinical spectrum has been

reported, with manifestations that include fever, malaise, anorexia, hepatosplenomegaly, acute myocarditis, and decreased cardiac function; approximately 10% of reported patients presented with fulminant myocarditis and congestive heart failure.

As noted in the section on non-vectorial transmission, available data suggest that transmission occurs in a minority of recipients of solid organs from *T. cruzi*–infected donors. In a patient series in Argentina, 3 (19%) of 16 recipients of kidney transplants from infected donors acquired *T. cruzi* infection. A similar transmission rate (2/11, 18%) was reported in kidney recipients in the United States. Based on these data, transplantation of kidneys from known infected donors may be considered with appropriate informed consent and post-transplantation monitoring.

#### Reactivation of Chronic *Trypanosoma cruzi* Infection in Organ Recipients

Patients with chronic *T. cruzi* infection are considered candidates for organ transplantation. Survival of patients who received a heart transplant because of chronic Chagas cardiomyopathy was better than among those with idiopathic or ischemic cardiomyopathy; *T. cruzi* reactivation was a rare cause of death.[33](#page-12-20) The cumulative risk of reactivation among patients who received a heart transplant for Chagas cardiomyopathy ranged from 29% to 50% in published cohort studies. Reactivation was diagnosed at times varying from 38 days to more than 7 years after transplantation. In addition to fever and acute Chagas myocarditis in the transplanted heart, common manifestations of reactivation disease include inflammatory panniculitis and skin nodules.[34](#page-12-21) Central nervous system (CNS) involvement has been reported, but is a much less frequent manifestation of reactivation among transplant recipients than in HIV–co-infected patients. Reactivation should be considered in the differential diagnosis of febrile episodes and apparent rejection crises. When reactivation is suspected, serial monitoring by peripheral blood buffy coat examination and polymerase chain reaction (PCR) is recommended[35](#page-12-22) (see "Utility of PCR for Diagnosis or Monitoring" and [Box 103.1\)](#page-6-0).

#### Reactivation of Chagas Disease in HIV/AIDS Patients

Reactivation of *T. cruzi* infection in HIV/AIDS patients can cause severe clinical disease with high risk of mortality[.36,37](#page-12-23) However, reactivation is not universal, even in those with low CD4<sup>+</sup> lymphocyte counts. The only published prospective cohort study followed 53 HIV–*T. cruzi* co-infected patients in Brazil for 1 to 190 months; 11 (21%) had *T. cruzi* reactivation diagnosed based on symptoms and/or microscopically detectable parasitemia[.37](#page-12-24) Symptomatic reactivation is seldom seen in patients until the CD4 count falls below 200. However, even in the absence of clinical reactivation, parasitemia levels are higher among HIV–co-infected patients compared with HIV-negative patients. Symptomatic *T. cruzi* reactivation in AIDS patients is most commonly reported to cause meningoencephalitis and/or *T. cruzi* brain abscesses; the presentation may be confused with CNS toxoplasmosis and should be considered in the differential diagnosis of CNS syndromes in AIDS patients. The second most commonly reported sign is acute myocarditis, sometimes superimposed on pre-existing chronic Chagas cardiomyopathy. Patients may present with new arrhythmias, pericardial effusion, acute cardiac decompensation, or accelerated progression of chronic heart disease. Less common manifestations of reactivation in HIV/AIDS patients include skin lesions; erythema nodosum; and parasitic invasion of the peritoneum, stomach, or intestine.

#### <span id="page-6-0"></span>**BOX 103.1** Management of *Trypanosoma cruzi*–Infected Blood Donors in the United States

In December 2006, the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) approved an ELISA assay to screen for antibodies to *T. cruzi* in donated blood. A second *T. cruzi* ELISA was approved for blood bank screening in April 2010. No confirmatory test has been approved by the FDA but, to date, most blood banks have used the radioimmune precipitation assay (RIPA). The FDA has not issued formal guidance for appropriate use of the tests, and screening of blood donations remains voluntary.

The management of a blood donor with reported positive results by blood bank screening assays should begin with confirmation by at least two serologic tests conducted by a diagnostic laboratory. Options for *T. cruzi* serologic testing in the United States are relatively limited. Three ELISA kits based on parasite lysate or recombinant antigens (Ortho ELISA [Raritan, NJ, USA], Wiener

Chagatest 3.0 [Riobamba, Rosario, Argentina], Hemagen [Columbia, MD, USA]) are currently FDA-cleared for diagnostic application. Of these three tests, the Ortho and Wiener ELISAs demonstrated high sensitivity and specificity in published evaluations[.67,68](#page-13-0) The CDC routinely tests each specimen by two conventional serologic assays and, when necessary, uses a third test to resolve discordant results. The CDC also provides information concerning patient evaluation and treatment, and acts as a reference laboratory for *T. cruzi* PCR (Parasitic Diseases Inquiries: Tel.: 404-718-4745; email: [chagas@](mailto:chagas@cdc.gov) [cdc.gov;](mailto:chagas@cdc.gov) website: <http://www.cdc.gov/parasites/chagas/index.html>).

Patients with confirmed infection should be counseled not to donate blood in the future, and testing should be offered to family members with likely exposure to vectorial transmission and children of *T. cruzi*–infected women.

depending on the phase of the disease and the immune status of the patient [\(Table 103.3\)](#page-7-0).

# **Utility of PCR for Diagnosis or Monitoring**

Molecular techniques currently provide the most sensitive tools for diagnosis of acute-phase and early congenital Chagas disease and to monitor for acute *T. cruzi* infection in the recipient of an infected organ or after accidental exposure (see [Table 103.3](#page-7-0)). PCR assays usually show positive results days to weeks before circulating trypomastigotes are visible by microscopy of peripheral blood[.38](#page-12-25) In chronic *T. cruzi* infection, PCR is used as a research tool but is not generally a useful diagnostic test. Quantitative PCR assays (e.g., real-time PCR) are useful for monitoring for

reactivation in immunosuppressed patients with chronic *T. cruzi* infection, such as an organ recipient or HIV–co-infected patient. In these patients, a positive result on conventional PCR does not prove reactivation, but quantitative PCR assays showing rising parasite numbers over time provide the earliest and most sensitive indicator of reactivation.[38](#page-12-25) The Centers for Disease Control (CDC) currently performs several conventional and real-time PCR assays with primers targeting kinetoplast and nuclear DNA (see [Box 103.1\)](#page-6-0).[39–41](#page-12-26)

#### **Diagnosis of Acute** *Trypanosoma cruzi* **Infection**

Because the parasitemia level is high during the acute phase, motile trypomastigotes can be detected by microscopy of fresh preparations of anti-coagulated blood or buffy coat[.3](#page-11-2) Parasites may be visualized in blood smears stained by Giemsa or other standard stains. Even without treatment, the parasitemia level decreases within 90 days of infection and is undetectable by microscopy in the chronic phase. PCR is a sensitive diagnostic tool in the acute phase of Chagas disease, to monitor for acute *T. cruzi* infection in the recipient of an infected organ, or after accidental exposure[.7](#page-11-6)

# **Diagnosis of Congenital** *Trypanosoma cruzi* **Infection**

In the first months of life, congenital Chagas disease is an acute *T. cruzi* infection and similar diagnostic methods are employed[.4](#page-11-3) Concentration methods give better sensitivity than direct examination of whole blood, such as the microhematocrit method. In this technique, cord or neonatal blood is collected and sealed in four to six heparinized microhematocrit tubes, centrifuged, and the buffy coat layer examined by microscopy. Repeated sampling on several occasions during the first months of life increases sensitivity. Hemoculture can increase sensitivity, but the technique is not widely available, and results are not available for 30 to 60 days. Molecular techniques have higher sensitivity and detect congenital infections earlier in life compared with the microhematocrit method[.42,43](#page-12-27) Transient detection of parasite DNA has occasionally been reported in specimens from infants who subsequently are found to be uninfected[.4](#page-11-3) For this reason, positive PCR results on two samples drawn on separate occasions are sometimes required for confirmation of congenital infection[.43](#page-12-28) PCR is increasingly used for the early diagnosis of congenital Chagas disease in Latin America and is the method of choice in industrialized countries. For infants not diagnosed at birth, conventional IgG serology (as outlined next for chronic *T. cruzi* infection) is recommended after 9 months of age, when transferred maternal antibody has disappeared and the congenital infection has passed into the chronic phase.

# **Diagnosis of Chronic** *Trypanosoma cruzi* **Infection**

Diagnosis of chronic infection relies on tests to detect IgG antibodies to *T. cruzi,* most commonly the enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) and immunofluorescent antibody assay (IFA). No single serologic assay has sufficient sensitivity and specificity to be relied on alone; two tests based on different antigens (e.g., whole parasite lysate and recombinant antigens) and/or techniques (e.g., ELISA, IFA, immunoblot) are used in parallel to increase the accuracy of the diagnosis[.4](#page-11-3) Published data suggest that the sensitivity of serologic assays varies by geographic location, possibly because of *T. cruzi* strain differences and resulting antibody responses[.44,45](#page-12-29) Inevitably, a proportion of individuals tested by two assays will have discordant serologic results and need further testing to resolve their infection status. The status of some individuals remains difficult to resolve, even after a third test, because there is no true gold-standard assay for chronic *T. cruzi* infection[.46](#page-12-30) Assays such as the radioimmune precipitation assay (RIPA) and trypomastigote excreted-secreted antigen immunoblot (TESA-blot) are promoted as reference tests, but even these do not have perfect sensitivity and specificity, and may not be capable of resolving the diagnosis.

#### **PATIENT EVALUATION**

The initial evaluation of a patient diagnosed with *T. cruzi* infection should begin with a complete medical history and physical examination. Details on family history, potential exposure to the vector, and history of blood transfusion in endemic areas should be recorded. A detailed review of systems should focus on cardiovascular and gastrointestinal symptoms [\(Table 103.4](#page-8-0)). Screening should be offered to other family members, including children of seropositive mothers, and the patient should be advised regarding possible transmission routes (such as blood and organ donation). An HIV test and/or evaluation for other causes of immunosuppression should be considered, as management of Chagas disease in these patients merits special attention.

Every *T. cruzi*–infected patient should have a resting 12-lead ECG with a 30-second rhythm strip; other tests should be ordered if warranted by signs and symptoms elicited during the history and examination. In the strict sense, the indeterminate form is defined by positive anti–*T. cruzi* serology in an asymptomatic person with a normal physical examination; a normal 12-lead ECG; and normal radiologic examination of the chest, esophagus, and colon. However, patients with a normal ECG and no cardiovascular and gastrointestinal symptoms have a favorable prognosis, and yearly follow-up may be sufficient without having to perform any additional tests.[2,47](#page-11-1)

Patients with cardiovascular symptoms and/or ECG abnormalities suggestive of Chagas cardiac disease (see [Tables 103.1](#page-4-3) and [103.4\)](#page-8-0) should undergo further evaluation, including two-dimensional (2-D) echocardiography, exercise testing, and 24-hour ambulatory ECG monitoring. A barium swallow or enema should be performed in patients with upper or lower gastrointestinal symptoms, respectively. Esophageal manometry may be of use for patients with suggestive symptoms in whom the barium swallow is inconclusive. Patients with megaesophagus may be at increased risk for esophageal cancer and an upper gastrointestinal endoscopy may be indicated, especially in patients with new or progressive symptoms. An increased risk of colorectal cancer has not been found in patients with megacolon.

Additional procedures may have a role in patient evaluation in the future. Segmental cardiac wall motion abnormalities detected by 2-D echocardiography and areas of myocardial fibrosis demonstrated by delayed-enhancement magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) have been found in patients with normal ECGs; research studies suggest that minor abnormalities of ventricular contractility may be predictive of future deterioration in function.[48–50](#page-12-31) Diastolic <span id="page-8-0"></span>**TABLE 103.4** Symptoms Suggestive of Chagas Disease that Should Be Queried in the Review of Systems

dysfunction and elevated blood levels of brain natriuretic peptide (BNP) appear to correlate with prognosis in patients with cardiomyopathy due to a variety of etiologies, including Chagas disease[.51](#page-12-32) Two-dimensional echo and 24-hour ambulatory ECG monitoring results are used to assess risk in some prognostic scores for Chagas disease.[31](#page-12-18)

# **MANAGEMENT**

Currently, the only available anti–*T. cruzi* drugs with proven efficacy in humans are benznidazole and nifurtimox. Both drugs have a high rate of adverse effects, especially in adults, and require prolonged treatment courses (usually 60–90 days). Tolerance and adherence are therefore sub-optimal. The cure rate in acute and early congenital infection is high, and these drugs have been accepted as standard of care since they were introduced in the 1970s. However, their use in the chronic phase has been more controversial, because of the lack of a reliable test of cure and the variable natural history of the disease. Adverse effects of benznidazole and nifurtimox with recommendations for management are outlined in [Table 103.5](#page-9-0). As of May 14, 2018, benznidazole is commercially available in the United States. Nifurtimox is not approved by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) but can be obtained free of charge from the CDC and used under investigational protocols (see [Box 103.1](#page-6-0)). Questions about drug access outside the United States can be addressed to the World Health Organization (<http://www.who.int/chagas/en/>).

#### **Specific Anti-Parasitic Drugs**

Nifurtimox, a nitrofuran compound, acts through production of nitrogenated free radicals (e.g., superoxide, hydrogen peroxide) for which parasites have much lower detoxification capacity than vertebrates[.52](#page-12-33) Benznidazole, a nitroimidazole derivative, is thought to act through the mechanism of reductive stress by covalent binding of nitroreduction intermediates to parasite molecules[.52](#page-12-33) Both drugs are rapidly absorbed from the gastrointestinal tract (plasma levels peak at 1 hour after a single oral dose); the average biological half-life is 12 hours. Nifurtimox is rapidly and extensively metabolized in the liver using cytochrome P-450 and P-450 reductase. Interindividual variability suggests that metabolism of nifurtimox may be under genetic control. Elimination of both drugs is predominantly renal. Hepatic or renal function impairment increases blood concentrations of the medication, increasing the risk of side effects. Concurrent alcohol intake may enhance the occurrence of side effects. Both drugs are mutagenic and have been reported to increase the risk of lymphomas in experimental animals. The drugs are known to be teratogenic in experimental animals, and their use in pregnant women is contraindicated. Risk for significant infant exposure to drugs through breast milk seems small and below the level of drug exposure of infants with Chagas disease receiving treatment doses of benznidazole or nifurtimox. This potential degree of exposure may not justify discontinuation of breastfeeding[.53,54](#page-12-34) Recent trials have all used benznidazole, and this drug is usually better tolerated than nifurtimox; for these reasons benznidazole is viewed by most experts as the first-line treatment. Nevertheless, individual tolerance varies—if one drug must be discontinued, the other can be used as an alternative. Nifurtimox is indicated for a patient in the acute phase with documented benznidazole treatment failure.

#### Evidence Base for Anti-Trypanosomal Drug Therapy

In symptomatic acute *T. cruzi* infection, treatment reduces severity and shortens the clinical course. The parasitologic cure rate in acute and early congenital infection ranges from 60% to 100% in published reports[.2](#page-11-1)

The degree of efficacy in chronic *T. cruzi* infection is still uncertain, in part because of a lack of a reliable test of cure. Results by conventional serology remain positive for years to decades after successful treatment, and experimental tests of cure have not been rigorously validated. In the second half of the 1990s, two double-blinded, randomized, placebo-controlled trials of benznidazole treatment in children with chronic *T. cruzi* infection demonstrated cure rates of 60% to 85%, as measured by conversion to negative serology 4 years post-treatment and, in one trial, by xenodiagnoses[.55,56](#page-12-35) Each trial used a different experimental serologic test to assess cure. Based on these trials, treatment of children up to 12 years of age with chronic *T. cruzi* infection became the standard of care by the late 1990s.

The evidence base for anti-trypanosomal treatment of adults with long-standing chronic *T. cruzi* infection remains suboptimal, but since 2000 there has been an increasing trend to offer treatment to these patients. This trend is based on the growing consensus that persistence of parasites, coupled with an unbalanced immune response in some individuals, leads to the sustained inflammatory responses that underlie the characteristic lesions of chronic Chagas cardiomyopathy. This new paradigm indicates that elimination of *T. cruzi* may be a prerequisite to arrest the evolution of Chagas disease and avert its irreversible long-term consequences, and implies that Chagas disease must be treated primarily as an infectious and not an autoimmune condition. In a non-randomized, non-blinded trial that included 566 adults followed for a mean of 9.8 years, benznidazole treatment was associated with decreased development and progression of Chagas cardiomyopathy[.57](#page-12-36) In a systematic review on the treatment of chronic Chagas disease with benznidazole compared with placebo or no treatment[,58](#page-12-37) benznidazole increased the probability of response to therapy 18-fold, although up to 18% of patients discontinued treatment because of toxicity. However, in the recently published BENEFIT trial, a multi-center, randomized, double-blinded, placebo-controlled trial in over 2800 patients with established Chagas cardiomyopathy, the hypothesis that benznidazole treatment could decrease disease progression was not confirmed[.59](#page-12-38) Some limitations to the study have recently been

Mild rash may be managed initially with oral antihistamines or steroids and by decreasing the dose or stopping the anti-trypanosomal drugs temporarily. A threefold increase in aspartate transaminase serum levels is an indication for decreasing or stopping the anti-trypanosomal drugs temporarily (reversible temporary secondary effect).

explored, including the advanced age and cardiomyopathy severity in the trial population[.26](#page-12-14) Further studies are warranted in adults with early Chagas cardiomyopathy or the indeterminate form of chronic Chagas disease.

#### **Indications for Anti-Trypanosomal Therapy**

Recommendations for anti-trypanosomal therapy vary according to phase and form of Chagas disease and by patient age ([Table](#page-10-0) [103.6](#page-10-0)).

#### Treatment of Acute and Early Congenital Infection

All acute and congenital infections should be treated. The earlier treatment is begun, the better the response obtained. There is a pediatric formulation (easily dispersible tablet of 12.5 mg) for use in infants and young children under 2 years of age (20 kg body weight).

#### Treatment of Chronic Infection

Treatment is indicated for all children up to age 18 years with chronic *T. cruzi* infection. For adults between 19 and 50 years who do not have advanced cardiomyopathy, treatment should generally be offered, bearing in mind the less certain efficacy and the higher frequency of side effects in adults compared with children. For adults older than 50 years, treatment is considered optional and should reflect a careful assessment of the potential risks and benefits. Characteristic early signs (e.g., right bundle branch block) may indicate a risk of future cardiac progression and may alter the risk–benefit equation toward treatment. On the other hand, a patient over 50 years of age with long-standing infection and no cardiac signs or symptoms may have a low risk of developing significant disease during the rest of their lifetime.

A recent pharmacokinetic study found lower benznidazole plasma concentrations in children than those previously reported

in adults treated with comparable mg/kg doses, attributed to a higher weight-corrected clearance rate in children. The high therapeutic response in children despite these lower drug levels in blood have raised the possibility that lower doses of benznidazole in adults may reduce side effects while maintaining efficacy[.60](#page-13-1)

#### Treatment of Immunocompromised Patients

Reactivation carries a high risk of morbidity and mortality even with adequate anti-parasitic treatment. Treatment consists of the standard daily dosage regimen, but the course may need to be prolonged based on the clinical and parasitologic response.

In patients with pre-existing *T. cruzi* infection who undergo organ transplantation, presumptive anti-trypanosomal treatment is unlikely to be curative and is not recommended in the absence of evidence of reactivation. Monitoring for *T. cruzi* reactivation is recommended with the same schedule used for rejection monitoring, for example 1, 3, 6, 9, and 12 months after transplantation, plus 1 month after steroid treatment for rejection and when fever or other symptoms occur. Laboratory testing should include microscopy and/or PCR of serial peripheral blood or buffy coat specimens, plus PCR and histologic examination of endomyocardial biopsy specimens collected for routine rejection monitoring.

Early effective antiretroviral therapy is essential in HIV–*T. cruzi* co-infected patients. In HIV–*T. cruzi* co-infected patients, standard dosing regimens are used for treatment of reactivation, but a more prolonged course (90–120 days) may be needed. The usefulness of suppressive treatment (secondary prophylaxis) after treatment has not been established. Secondary prophylaxis with benznidazole 5 mg/kg/day PO in two doses administered 3 days per week has been used empirically, but data on efficacy are lacking. Benznidazole is mainly metabolized in the liver by the cytochrome P-450 system, and some antiretroviral drugs could increase or decrease efficacy and synergize toxicity of benznidazole. There are no published reports of immune reconstitution syndrome (IRIS) in HIV–*T. cruzi* co-infected patients.

# **Documentation of Response After Specific Treatment**

For monitoring response to treatment of acute, early congenital, or reactivated *T. cruzi* infection, direct examination of blood or buffy coat, hemoculture, and PCR have high sensitivity. In the chronic phase, negative seroconversion by conventional assays occurs after successful treatment, but takes years to decades, making this an impractical test of cure. There is currently no standard test recommended for the assessment of response to treatment in chronic *T. cruzi* infection. Quantitative PCR has been used as an outcome measure in clinical trials; negative results do not indicate cure, but positive results indicate treatment failure. A recent randomized pilot study found benznidazole-treated patients showed significantly less immune activation and lower regulatory T-cell counts, with an increased Th17 and Th1 response compared with untreated patients[.61](#page-13-2)

# **Novel Anti-Trypanosomal Drug Candidates**

New drugs with high efficacy and with a better side effect profile are urgently needed, especially for the treatment of chronic infection[.62](#page-13-3) Triazole derivatives combine potent inhibition of *T. cruzi* ergosterol biosynthesis and pharmacokinetic properties (long terminal elimination half-life and large distribution volume), and were considered promising candidates based on animal models. However, two recent randomized clinical trials showed low longterm efficacy of posaconazole using *T. cruzi* PCR results as the primary end point. In per-protocol analyses, 80% to 90% of patients in the posaconazole groups (high dose 400 mg twice daily or low-dose 100 mg twice daily for 60 days) had treatment failure based on positive PCR results during 12 months of follow-up, compared with 6% of the benznidazole group[.63](#page-13-4) In the second study (comparing posaconazole 400 mg twice daily, benznidazole 200 mg + placebo twice daily, benznidazole 200 mg + posaconazole 400 mg twice daily, and placebo 10 mg twice daily) benznidazole monotherapy was superior to posaconazole and no advantages were observed with combined therapy compared with benznidazole monotherapy.[64](#page-13-5) Other possible drug candidates include newer 5-nitroimidazoles (fexinidazole) and inhibitors of protein or purine synthesis, trypanothione metabolism, cysteine protease, phospholipids (miltefosine), or pyrophosphate metabolism (risedronate).

#### **Management of Cardiac Disease**

#### Congestive Heart Failure Treatment

In the absence of randomized controlled trials, treatment of patients with Chagas heart failure has been extrapolated from guidelines developed for the management of heart failure from other causes ([Table 103.7\)](#page-11-7)[.2,29](#page-11-1) Increased doses of diuretics are justified in the advanced stages of disease because of the predominance of systemic congestive manifestations over signs of pulmonary congestion. Angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors (captopril, enalapril) can reduce myocarditis and fibrosis in *T. cruzi* infection in animal models. Calcium channel antagonists (verapamil) may act early in the course of *T. cruzi* infection to prevent ventricular dilatation and myocardial dysfunction in animal models. Palliative procedures, such as dynamic cardiomyoplasty and partial left ventriculectomy, are contraindicated because of unsatisfactory results.

#### Anti-Arrhythmic Treatment

Almost all of the widely used anti-arrhythmic agents have been used in patients with Chagas disease. The potential role of β-blockers, possibly in combination with amiodarone, to reduce mortality remains to be established. The β-blockers have been classically avoided in chagasic patients because of conduction defects, but in some studies β-blockers have been associated with improved survival. Observational data suggest that amiodarone may improve survival in cardiomyopathy patients at high risk of death from malignant arrhythmias. Thus amiodarone is usually recommended as the treatment of choice for all patients with

sustained ventricular tachycardia and for those with non-sustained ventricular tachycardia and myocardial dysfunction. Because of the high occurrence of thromboembolic phenomena, oral anticoagulants are recommended for patients with atrial fibrillation, previous embolism, apical aneurysm, and mural thrombus. Recommendations for permanent cardiac pacing are sinus node dysfunction, atrial fibrillation with AV block, second- and third-degree AV block, and trifascicular block, among others. Implantable cardioverter-defibrillators are the first-line therapeutic option for primary and secondary prevention of terminating life-threatening arrhythmias in patients with depressed LV function. Radiofrequency catheter ablation could be an option in patients with recurrent ventricular tachycardia. Cardiac resynchronization has become an established treatment for patients with moderate to severe heart failure, wide QRS complex, optimized heart failure treatment, and evidence of ventricular dyssynchrony, and it is also a promising therapy for patients with refractory heart failure.

#### Cell Therapy

Heart transplantation is currently the only available option for patients with heart failure who have failed optimal medical management. Although animal experiments suggested that stem cell–based therapy may be therapeutic in the management of heart failure in Chagas cardiomyopathy, a recent randomized study found intracoronary injection of autologous bone-marrow–derived mononuclear cells did not improve LV function or quality of life in patients with chronic chagasic cardiomyopathy.[65,66](#page-13-6)

# **Management of Digestive Disease**

There are no data to suggest that anti-parasitic treatment affects progression of gastrointestinal tract disease. Treatment of megaesophagus is similar to that for idiopathic achalasia[.35](#page-12-22) Sublingual nitrates and nifedipine induce lower esophageal-sphincter relaxation and could be used before meals. Non-advanced megaesophagus is best treated by laparoscopic Heller's myotomy and fundoplication, a more definitive form of treatment. In advanced cases, different techniques of esophageal resection have been used with variable results.

The early stage of colonic dysfunction can be treated with a fiber-rich diet and abundant fluid intake, as well as laxatives and intermittent enemas. Fecal impaction can occur as the disease progresses, requiring manual emptying under general anesthesia. Patients with megacolon who fail to respond to conservative measures, and those with frequent fecaloma or sigmoid volvulus, need to undergo surgical organ resection.
