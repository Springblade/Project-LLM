## **139.1** Seafood Poisoning: Fish and Shellfish Poisoning

*David A. Warrell*

#### KEY FEATURES

- • Food poisoning from toxins in fish, shellfish, and crustaceans, rather than pathogenic organisms, is prevalent in many ocean communities and is increasingly recognized in travelers and those who eat exotic fish. Toxins are ultimately derived from dinoflagellates, diatoms, and bacteria.
- • As most seafood toxins are thermostable, cooking does not remove the risk of poisoning. Certain species of very large reef fish (e.g., moray eels, parrot fish, puffer fish) and fish viscera should be strictly avoided, and shellfish should not be eaten when there are red tides or when marine birds and mammals are dying off.
- • Diarrheal, neurotoxic, paralytic, and amnesic syndromes of shellfish poisoning are recognized. Acute gastrointestinal symptoms are associated variously with paresthesia and more serious paralytic and central nervous system (CNS) symptoms that can be fatal. Treatment is symptomatic.
- • Ciguatera and tetrodotoxic fish poisonings cause acute gastrointestinal symptoms followed by paresthesia and neurotoxic or paralytic symptoms.
- • Scombroid fish poisoning produces anaphylactic, histamine-like symptoms caused by eating fish spoiled by bacterial decomposition.
- • Palytoxin, Haff disease, carp gallbladder, and *Pfiesteria*-associated poisoning are also discussed.

## **INTRODUCTIO[N1](#page-3-0)**

Inhabitants of oceanic islands and sea coasts who are largely dependent on marine animals for their protein intake are at particular risk of acute gastrointestinal symptoms ("food poisoning") after eating toxic seafood ([Table 139.1.1](#page-1-0)). In some island communities, such as Kiribati, Tokelau, and Tuvalu in the Pacific region, up to 2% of the population may be affected each year. Globalization of the seafood industry and expanding appetites for novel gustatory experiences or use as traditional medicines now ensure that exotic tropical fish, crustaceans, and mollusks are widely available in fish markets worldwide [\(Fig. 139.1.1\)](#page-1-1)

#### **PREVENTION OF SEAFOOD POISONING**

Most marine toxins are heat-stable, and so cooking does not prevent poisoning. However, some toxins are fairly water-soluble and may be leached out by soaking. In tropical areas, the flesh of fish and crabs should be separated as soon as possible from the head, skin, intestines, gonads, and other viscera that may contain high concentrations of toxin. All scale-less fish should be regarded as potentially tetrodotoxic. Fish may accumulate toxins from the food chain throughout their lives, and so very large reef fish carry the highest risk of being ciguatera-toxic. Certain species are especially dangerous, such as moray eels and parrot fish (Scaridae), and should never be eaten. Scombroid poisoning can be prevented by eating only fresh fish or by freezing fish as soon as possible after they are caught. Shellfish should never be eaten during the dangerous seasons, when red tides declare the blooming of toxic dinoflagellates that kill fish, sea birds and marine mammals. In wealthier countries, there is increasing surveillance of levels of toxins in seafood by regulatory authorities (in the United States by Food and Drug Administration [FDA] and Centers for Disease Control and Prevention [CDC]).

## **CIGUATERA FISH POISONIN[G2](#page-3-1)**

Ciguatera is by far the most common cause of seafood poisoning worldwide. Its estimated global incidence is 50,000 to 500,000 cases per year with a case fatality of 0.1%. Ciguatera is often misdiagnosed because of ignorance of its distinctive clinical syndrome and lack of rapid diagnostic assays. The increasing market for exotic fish from the Caribbean and elsewhere has led to cases of ciguatera in Britain, other European countries, and North America. Thanks to climate change and destruction of coral reef systems, the distribution of ciguatoxic fish has extended from tropical/sub-tropical waters to the Eastern Atlantic, Gulf of Mexico, Eastern Mediterranean, Eastern Atlantic Ocean, and Canary Islands.[3](#page-3-2)

The tropical reef fish most likely to be toxic are groupers, snappers, parrot fish, trigger fish, surgeonfish, mackerel, moray eels ([Fig. 139.1.2](#page-1-2)), barracudas, and jacks.

Toxins are polyethers, such as ciguatoxin (activates Na<sup>+</sup> channels), maitotoxin (activates Ca2<sup>+</sup> channels), and scaritoxin, ultimately derived along the food chain from benthic dinoflagellates such as *Gambierdiscus toxicus.* They are concentrated in the liver, viscera, and gonads of fish.

Symptoms[4](#page-3-3) include a burning sensation or metallic taste in the mouth, which may be experienced about 45 minutes after ingestion, followed 1 to 6 hours later (extreme range: minutes to 30 hours) by gastrointestinal symptoms—nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, and abdominal colic—that subside within a week. Patients feel cold and within 24 hours have generalized pruritus. In some, neurologic symptoms follow within the first 2 days: paresthesia around the mouth and extremities, a sensation of having painful or loose teeth, reversed hot–cold sensation (cold allodynia or dysesthesia) especially of the extremities, weakness, ataxia, arthralgia, myalgia, and even dyspareunia. Neuropsychiatric symptoms such as confusion, amnesia, depression, and fatigue may develop within days or weeks. Life-threatening cardiovascular features include bradycardia, hypotension, and hypovolemia. Rashes are also described. These symptoms usually resolve within a few hours, but in about 5% of cases, they persist for a week, or even months and

<span id="page-1-1"></span>exceptionally up to a year as "chronic ciguatera." Geographically distinct clinical patterns have been identified in the Caribbean (predominantly gastrointestinal), Pacific (more neurotoxic), and Indian Oceans (hallucinations, incoordination, dysequilibration, depression, and nightmares), reflecting variation in the prevailing toxins.

Similar, but much more severe, symptoms (chelonitoxism) may follow ingestion of marine turtles, especially hawksbill turtle (*Eretmochelys imbricata*), in the Indo-Pacific area, but the case fatality is much higher[.5](#page-3-4)

## **TETRODOTOXIN POISONING**

Marine scale-less fish, such as puffer, porcupine ([Fig. 139.1.3](#page-2-0)), toad, and sun fish (order Tetraodonitiformes), may become highly poisonous in certain seasons, such as May to June—the spawning <span id="page-1-2"></span>season in Japan. Eating these fish is proscribed in the Old Testament (e.g., Leviticus 11:9-12). Puffer fish ("fugu") is particularly popular in Japan where, despite stringent regulations, there are still cases of tetrodotoxin poisoning, with about four deaths each year.

Tetrodotoxin, an aminoperhydroquinazoline, is one of the most potent non-protein toxins known. It produces neurotoxic and cardiotoxic effects by blocking voltage-gated Na<sup>+</sup> channels. It has been detected in animals of six different phyla: it is concentrated in the ovaries, viscera, and skin of tetraodontiform fish; in the skin of newts (genus *Taricha*), frogs and toads (genera *Colostethus, Atelopus, Bracycephalus*), and salamanders; in xanthid crabs (Xanthidae); in the saliva of octopuses; in the digestive glands of several species of gastropod mollusks; and in a starfish, flat worm (*Planorbis* spp.), and nemertine worms in Japan. Its ultimate source is bacteria (*Pseudomonas, Pseudoalteromonas, Vibrio* spp., etc.). West African and Southeast Asian freshwater puffer fish (e.g., *Pao* [*Tetraodon*] *fangi* in Thailand)

<span id="page-2-0"></span>have caused poisoning. In northeast Thailand, saxitoxin was implicated and is also responsible for paralytic shellfish poisoning.

Nausea and abdominal pain occur in 10 to 45 minutes (maximum 3 hours), usually without other gastrointestinal symptoms. Neurotoxic symptoms evolve within 10 to 45 minutes: paresthesia of the lips, tongue, and throat; altered taste; dizziness; headache; sweating; hypersalivation; ataxia; and flaccid ascending paralysis with fasciculationsleading to respiratory failure.Hypotension (shock) may develop with cardiac brady- or tachyarrhythmias. Exfoliative dermatitis, erythema, petechiae, and blistering are also described.

Fatalities usually occur 2 to 6 hours after eating the fish. Patients usually remain conscious throughout, although they may appear comatose. Patients with fixed dilated pupils and brainstem areflexia are not necessarily brain dead. They may recover with assisted ventilation.

## **HISTAMINE FISH POISONING (SCOMBROID FISH POISONING OR PSEUDOALLERGIC FISH POISONING)[6](#page-3-5)**

Unless eaten fresh or adequately frozen, the histidine-rich dark-red flesh of scombroid fish (tuna, mackerel, bonito, and skipjack) and of canned non-scombroid fish (mahi-mahi, sardine, anchovy, herring, pilchard, ocean salmon) may decompose. Scombroid fish poisoning is underdiagnosed but is the most commonly reported kind of seafood poisoning in the United States.

Bacteria such as *Proteus morgana, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Enterobacter, Serratia, Citrobacter, Escherichia coli, Clostridium, Vibrio, Acinetobacter, Pseudomonas,* and *Photobacterium* are responsible. Their histidine decarboxylase converts fish muscle histidine into saurine, histamine, cadaverine, putrescine, and other unidentified toxins: 100 g of spoiled fish may contain almost 1 g of histamine.Histamine absorbed from the gut is normally broken down by *N*-methyl-transferase and diamine oxidase (histaminase), but if the histamine concentration is very high, or if the patient is taking a diamine oxidase inhibitor such as isoniazid (as anti-tuberculosis chemotherapy) or a monoamine oxidase inhibitor, scombroid poisoning may result.

Toxic fish may produce an immediate tingling or smarting sensation in the mouth or a metallic, bitter, or peppery flavor on first contact. Usually within 20 to 30 minutes, but up to a few hours after ingestion, there is flushing of the face, neck, and trunk; burning; sweating; pruritis; and urticarial rash, followed by throbbing headache, palpitations, nausea, dry mouth, abdominal colic, vomiting, diarrhea, angioedema, bronchial asthma, dizziness, and syncope. Cardiac complications include tachyarrhythmias, coronary artery vasospasm, and myocardial ischemia. Full recovery is expected over 6 to 8 hours, but symptoms may persist for up to 24 hours. No fatalities are reported.

## **SEAFOOD POISONING WITH GENERALIZED RHABDOMYOLYSIS**

Palytoxin is a potent Na<sup>+</sup> -K<sup>+</sup> ATPase inhibitor occurring in zoanthid corals (*Palythoa toxica*)*,* red algae, sea anemones, and in dinoflagellates (*Ostrepsis siamensis*)[.7](#page-3-6) Tropical aquarium keepers may notice conjunctival and dermal burning after cleaning out tanks. Ingestion of palytoxin in reef fish, crabs, and shellfish causes acute gastrointestinal symptoms followed by paresthesias, hypertension, distorted sense of taste (dysgeusia), rhabdomyolysis, cardiac arrhythmias, respiratory failure, and coma, rapidly progressing to death. There is no specific treatment.

Haff disease, named after Frisches Haff in Kaliningrad, has been reported from Sweden; Russia; the Baltic coast; and, more recently, from North America, Brazil, and China. Within 24 hours of eating cooked sea fish or freshwater crayfish, victims develop myalgia, myoglobinuria, and evidence of generalized rhabdomyolysis with a risk of acute kidney injury (AKI). The heat-stable toxin is unidentified.

## **POISONING BY INGESTING CARP GALLBLADDER[8](#page-3-7)**

In parts of South Asia and the Far East, raw bile and gallbladder of freshwater carp (e.g., grass carp [*Ctenopharyngodon idellus*], Jullien's golden carp [*Probarbus jullieni*], and Indian rohu [*Labeo rohita*]) are believed to have medicinal properties. Acute abdominal pain, vomiting, and watery diarrhea develop 2 to 18 hours after ingesting raw bile or gallbladder of these fish, followed by hepato-renal syndrome. 5α-cyprinol sulfate has been implicated.

## **SHELLFISH POISONIN[G9](#page-3-8)**

Filter-feeding bivalve mollusks, commonly termed *shellfish*, concentrate pathogenic bacteria and phycotoxins derived from dinoflagellates, diatoms, cyanobacteria, and other marine microalgae. Several different clinical syndromes of shellfish poisoning are described.

#### **Diarrheal (Diarrhetic) Shellfish Poisoning and Azaspiracid Shellfish Poisoning**

Within 30 minutes to 12 hours of eating contaminated bivalve shellfish, such as mussels, scallops, cockles, oysters, and whelks (as well as green crabs), patients have diarrhea, nausea, vomiting, and abdominal colic, recovering within 3 days. Outbreaks have been reported in Japan, Europe, and elsewhere.

Okadaic acid and other dinophysis toxins and pectenotoxins are phosphatase inhibitors derived from *Dinophysis* and *Prorocentrum* dinoflagellates. Azaspiracid analogs from *Protoperidinium crassipes* and *Azadinium spinosum* dinoflagellates cause diarrheal poisoning after ingestion of mussels, oysters, clams, and scallops in Europe, Japan, North Africa, and elsewhere. The toxin is potentially carcinogenic.

#### **Neurotoxic Shellfish Poisoning**

Thirty minutes to 3 hours after eating contaminated bivalve mollusks, patients develop gastroenteritis, chills, sweats, hypotension, arrhythmias, and ciguatera-like paresthesia, including cold allodynia, with myalgia, muscle spasms, vertigo, and ataxia. Paralysis, seizures, and coma are rare complications. Symptoms usually last for a few days. Inhalation of harmful algal blooms in sea spray causes conjunctival, nasal, and bronchial irritation.

Brevetoxins are derived from dinoflagellates *Karenia brevis* (formerly *Gymnodinium breve, G. brevis,* or *Ptychodicus brevis*). They are responsible for harmful algal blooms, sometimes visible as "red tides." Marine birds, mammals, and fish are killed off in large numbers. In the United Kingdom there have been several outbreaks of neurotoxic red whelk (*Neptunea antiqua*) poisoning attributable to tetramine.

#### **Paralytic Shellfish Poisoning**

Symptoms can develop within 30 minutes of eating bivalve mollusks, such as mussels, clams, oysters, cockles, and scallops, as well as xanthid, coconut, and horseshoe crabs. Circumoral paresthesia spreads to the face, neck, and extremities. More severe poisoning causes headache, nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, and descending paralysis: dysarthria, dysphagia, ataxia, diplopia, dizziness, incoherent speech, lightheadedness, and increasing dyspnea. Fatal respiratory paralysis supervenes within 12 hours in 8% of untreated cases.

Tetrahydropurine neurotoxins such as saxitoxin and gonyautoxins from dinoflagellates (*Alexandrium* spp., *Pyrodinium bahamense* var. *compressum,* and *Gymnodinium catenatum*) are responsible. They bloom between latitudes 30°N and 30°S in the warmer months of May to October to produce a "red tide." Many dead fish, sea birds, and marine mammals will litter the beaches.

#### **Amnesic Shellfish Poisoning**

Gastroenteritis starts within 24 hours of exposure to mussels and other bivalve mollusks, such as scallops and razor clams, and crustaceans. In about half the cases, neurotoxic symptoms develop within 48 hours. Severe headache and short-term memory loss are common. Amnesia is sometimes permanent. Severe symptoms include agitation, seizures, coma, profuse respiratory secretions, circulatory instability, and death. Elderly patients and those with underlying illnesses are more likely to suffer amnesia. Outbreaks have been reported in North America, Europe, and elsewhere. Affected sea birds and marine animals behave bizarrely and many die. Domoic acid is derived from diatoms (*Pseudo-nitzschia* spp.).

## *Pfiesteria***-Associated Possible Estuary-Associated Syndrome**

Although the toxic dinoflagellate *Pfiesteria piscicida* is commonly associated with fish kills and can be concentrated in shellfish, toxic exposure in humans is thought to be by direct contact with the toxin, absorbed through the skin or from aerosols. It became a major environmental concern in the coastal waters of North Carolina, Virginia, and Maryland in the late 1990s. *Pfiesteria*-associated possible estuaryassociated syndrome (PEAS) was characterized by impaired cognitive function and rapid and severe decrements in visual contrast sensitivity. PEAS signs and symptoms responded to cholestyramine treatment, supporting the hypothesis that PEAS was a biotoxin-associated illness. The status and etiology of PEAS remain controversial.

## **LABORATORY DIAGNOSIS OF SEAFOOD POISONING**

Diagnosis of human cases is usually clinical, based on the nature of the exposure, epidemiologic circumstances, and incubation period. Toxins can be detected in fish or shellfish samples or remains of toxic meals by regulatory authorities using functional assays, for example, for ciguatoxins, tetrodotoxins, and diarrhetic shellfish toxins (rapid protein phosphatase 2A inhibition assay); immunodetection using enzyme immunosorbent assay (EIA) (e.g., for tetrodotoxins, histamine in scombroid poisoning) and physicochemical methods such as liquid chromatography tandem mass spectrometry (LC-MS/MS) (e.g., for saxitoxins, domoic acid); and reverse-phase highperformance liquid chromatography or flow injection analysis for histamine. Toxins are not detectable in clinical samples, with the exception of saxitoxin in the urine in paralytic shellfish poisoning.

#### **DIFFERENTIAL DIAGNOSIS**

Gastrointestinal symptoms must be distinguished from bacterial and viral food poisoning if the incubation period is longer (days), unless they are caused by a pre-formed toxin (e.g., staphylococcal, clostridial, and *Bacillus cereus* poisoning). Infectious causes include viruses: hepatitis A virus (mollusks, especially clams and oysters), Norwalk virus (clams and oysters) and astroviruses and caliciviruses (cockles and other mollusks); bacteria and their toxins: *Vibrio parahaemolyticus* (crustaceans, especially shrimps), *V. cholerae* (crabs and mollusks), non-O group 1 *V. cholerae* (oysters), *V. vulnificus* (oysters), *Aeromonas hydrophila* (frozen oysters), *Plesiomonas shigelloides* (oysters, mussels, mackerel, cuttlefish), *Shigella* spp. (mollusks), *Campylobacter jejuni* (clams), *Salmonella typhi* (mollusks), *Clostridium botulinum* (smoked and canned salmon); and the nematode worm *Anisakis* (raw or fermented fish). Neurologic symptoms suggest some kind of neurotoxic seafood poisoning or botulism. Allergic reactions produce anaphylactic symptoms (pruritus, urticaria, erythema, angioedema, bronchospasm, and shock), sometimes within minutes of ingestion. Unless there is a past history of specific seafood allergy (e.g., to prawns, tuna) or an epidemiologic clue (several diners affected), it can be difficult to distinguish allergy from scombroid poisoning. Fortunately, emergency treatment is the same for both. Allergy is supported by demonstration of fish-specific immunoglobulin E (IgE) by skin prick testing or radioallergosorbent test (RAST), and anaphylaxis by raised plasma mast cell tryptase or urinary prostaglandin D2 and its metabolites.

#### **TREATMENT OF SEAFOOD POISONING**

No specific treatments or antidotes are available. Elimination of gastrointestinal contents should be attempted only if it can be achieved safely within 1 to 2 hours of ingestion. Repeated-dose activated charcoal binds saxitoxin and some other shellfish toxins, limiting their enterohepatic circulation, but cholestyramine has no demonstrable value. Fluid losses through vomiting and diarrhea must be replaced parenterally. In patients with hypotension and sinus bradycardia, atropine may be beneficial.

The value of early mannitol (0.5–1.0 g/kg body weight IV over 30–45 minutes within 48–72 hours of exposure) remains uncertain in cases of ciguatera but is safe and widely recommended.[10](#page-3-9) In chronic ciguatera, amitriptyline, tocainide, fluoxetine, duloxetine, gabapentin, and pregabalin have been used with variable success.

For tetrodotoxic and paralytic shellfish poisoning, anticholinesterases are ineffective, but endotracheal intubation, mechanical ventilation, and cardiac resuscitation have proved lifesaving. In Malaysia, a patient with tetrodotoxin poisoning appeared brain dead with fixed dilated pupils and brainstem areflexia but made a complete recovery after being mechanically ventilated.

Scombroid-related symptoms can be alleviated with epinephrine, anti-H1 histamine blockers, adrenergic β-2 agonist bronchodilators, and fluid replacement.
