# **38.5** West Nile Virus

*Marc Fischer, J. Erin Staples*

## KEY FEATURES

- • West Nile virus (WNV) is transmitted to humans primarily through bites of infected mosquitoes.
- • WNV has been documented on all continents except Antarctica, but has most recently caused large seasonal outbreaks in the Middle East, Europe, and North America.
- • Most human WNV infections are asymptomatic (~80%), but clinical illness ranges from a systemic febrile illness (~20%) to severe neurologic disease (<1%).
- • The incidence of WNV encephalitis and death increases with age.
- • As there is no treatment or vaccine for WNV disease, prevention depends on community-level mosquito control programs, avoiding exposure to infected mosquitoes, and screening blood and organ donors.

## **INTRODUCTION**

West Nile virus (WNV) is a mosquito-borne, single-stranded, positive-sense RNA flavivirus (family Flaviviridae*,* genus *Flavivirus*) that was first isolated in Uganda in 1937.[1,2](#page-1-0) For the next 50 years, WNV received little attention as a cause of epidemics of febrile illness and sporadic encephalitis in parts of Africa, Asia, and Europe. Beginning in the 1990s, WNV outbreaks with a higher incidence of neurologic disease were identified in the Mediterranean Basin and Eastern Europe[.1](#page-1-0) WNV was first detected in the Western Hemisphere in New York City in 1999, where it subsequently spread across the continental United States and Canada, resulting in large seasonal outbreaks of both systemic febrile illness and neuroinvasive disease[.3–5](#page-1-1) More recently, WNV disease has reemerged in Eastern and Southern Europe[.6](#page-1-2)

## **EPIDEMIOLOGY**

WNV is the most widely distributed arthropod-borne virus (arbovirus) in the world, with transmission documented on every continent except Antarctica[.1,2](#page-1-0) Since the 1990s, the largest outbreaks of WNV neuroinvasive disease have occurred in the Middle East, Europe, and North America. In temperate and subtropical regions, most human WNV infections occur in summer or early autumn. In the tropics, the incidence is likely greatest during the rainy season, but data are scarce. Although all age groups and both sexes are equally susceptible to WNV infection, the incidence of encephalitis and death increases with age and male sex.[4](#page-1-3)

# **NATURAL HISTORY, PATHOGENESIS, AND PATHOLOGY**

WNV is primarily transmitted to humans through bites of infected *Culex* species mosquitoes.[7](#page-1-4) Birds are the primary amplifying hosts. Mosquitoes acquire WNV by feeding on infected birds and transmit the virus to humans and other vertebrates during subsequent feeding. Infected humans usually have <7 days of low-level viremia that is insufficient to transmit WNV to feeding mosquitoes. Nevertheless, human-to-human WNV transmission can occur through blood transfusion and organ transplantation[.8,9](#page-1-5) Intrauterine and probable breastfeeding transmission also have been rarely described. Percutaneous and aerosol transmission have occurred in laboratory workers, and one outbreak among turkey handlers suggested WNV transmission via aerosol.

## **CLINICAL FEATURES**

Approximately 80% of human WNV infections are asymptomatic[.10,11](#page-1-6) In clinical infections, the incubation period usually is 2 to 6 days, but can be up to 21 days in immunocompromised people. Most symptomatic persons experience an acute systemic febrile illness that often includes headache, myalgia, or arthralgia; gastrointestinal symptoms and a transient maculopapular rash also are commonly reported. Less than 1% of infected people develop neuroinvasive disease, which typically manifests as meningitis, encephalitis, or myelitis. Patients with encephalitis may present with seizures, mental status changes, focal neurologic deficits, or movement disorders. WNV myelitis is often clinically and pathologically identical to poliomyelitis caused by polioviruses, with damage of anterior horn cells in the spinal cord (anterior myelitis); it usually presents as acute flaccid paralysis and may progress to respiratory failure requiring mechanical ventilation. WNVassociated Guillain–Barré syndrome also has been reported and can be distinguished from WNV myelitis by clinical manifestations and electrophysiologic testing. Cardiac dysrhythmias, myocarditis, rhabdomyolysis, optic neuritis, uveitis, chorioretinitis, orchitis, pancreatitis, and hepatitis have been rarely described after WNV infection.

Most patients with WNV non-neuroinvasive disease or meningitis recover completely, but fatigue, malaise, and weakness can linger for weeks or months[.10,11](#page-1-6) Patients who recover from WNV encephalitis or myelitis often have residual neurologic deficits. Among patients with neuroinvasive disease, the overall case-fatality rate is approximately 10%, but it is significantly higher in WNV encephalitis and myelitis than in WNV meningitis. Risk factors for developing neuroinvasive or severe disease include older age, immunocompromising conditions or therapies, chronic renal disease, diabetes, hypertension, and alcohol abuse.[12](#page-1-7)

## **PATIENT EVALUATION, DIAGNOSIS, AND DIFFERENTIAL DIAGNOSIS**

Routine clinical laboratory results are generally non-specific in WNV infections. In patients with central nervous system disease, cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) examination generally shows lymphocytic pleocytosis, but neutrophils may predominate early in the illness[.10,11](#page-1-6) Brain magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) is frequently normal, but signal abnormalities may be seen in the basal ganglia, thalamus, and brainstem with WNV encephalitis, and in the spinal cord with WNV myelitis.

WNV infections are most frequently confirmed by detection of anti-WNV immunoglobulin M (IgM) antibodies in serum or CSF[.13](#page-1-8) The presence of anti-WNV IgM antibodies is usually good evidence of recent WNV infection, but may indicate infection with another closely related flavivirus (e.g., St. Louis encephalitis, Japanese encephalitis, dengue, or possibly Zika viruses). As anti-WNV IgM can persist in some patients for >1 year, a positive test result occasionally may reflect past, rather than recent, WNV infection. Serum collected within the first week of illness onset may lack detectable IgM; the test should be repeated on a convalescent-phase sample. Plaque-reduction neutralization tests can be performed to confirm recent infection by demonstrating a greater-than-fourfold change in WNV-specific neutralizing antibody titers between acute- and convalescent-phase serum samples and to rule out primary infection with a closely related flavivirus. In patients who have been previously infected by another flavivirus or vaccinated with a flavivirus vaccine (e.g., Japanese encephalitis or yellow fever), broadly cross-reactive antibodies may make it difficult to incriminate a specific flavivirus.

Nucleic acid amplification tests for WNV RNA can be performed on acute-phase serum, CSF, or tissue specimens; immunohistochemical staining can detect WNV antigens in fixed tissue, but the sensitivity of these tests is low and negative results are not definitive.

WNV disease should be considered in the differential diagnosis of febrile or acute neurologic illnesses associated with recent exposure to mosquitoes, blood transfusion, or organ transplantation, and of illnesses in neonates whose mothers were infected with WNV during pregnancy or while breastfeeding. In addition to other more common causes of encephalitis and aseptic meningitis (e.g., herpes simplex virus and enteroviruses), other arboviruses should be considered in the differential etiology of suspected WNV illness.

## **TREATMENT**

No specific antiviral treatment for WNV disease exists[.14,15](#page-1-9) Therapy consists of supportive care and management of complications. Several vaccines against WNV are licensed for use in horses; candidate human WNV vaccines are being evaluated.[14](#page-1-9) Information regarding the latest WNV treatment and vaccine trials can be found at <https://clinicaltrials.gov/ct2/home>and [https://www.cdc.gov/](https://www.cdc.gov/westnile/resources/pdfs/WNV-therapeutics-summary-P.pdf) [westnile/resources/pdfs/WNV-therapeutics-summary-P.pdf](https://www.cdc.gov/westnile/resources/pdfs/WNV-therapeutics-summary-P.pdf).

In the absence of a human vaccine, prevention of WNV disease depends on screening blood and organ donors, implementing community-level mosquito control programs, and avoiding exposure to infected mosquitoes[.1](#page-1-0) Personal protective measures include the use of mosquito repellents, wearing long-sleeved shirts and long pants, and limiting outdoor exposure from dusk to dawn. Using air conditioning, installing window and door screens, and reducing peri-domestic mosquito breeding sites can further decrease the risk for WNV exposure.

# **38.6** St. Louis Encephalitis and Rocio Viruses

*James J. Sejvar, Emily J. Curren, Susan L. Hills*

## KEY FEATURES

- • St. Louis encephalitis virus (SLEV) and Rocio virus are transmitted to humans by infected mosquitoes.
- • Both SLEV and Rocio virus cause central nervous system disease, including meningitis and encephalitis.
- • SLEV previously was the leading cause of arboviral encephalitis in the United States, causing periodic large urban outbreaks; however, since the introduction and spread of West Nile virus, SLEV disease incidence has decreased and few outbreaks have been reported.
- • Rocio virus resulted in a large outbreak of encephalitis in Brazil from 1975 to 1977; it has rarely been identified since then.
- • There is no vaccine or specific treatment for SLEV or Rocio virus infections; management is symptomatic.

# **INTRODUCTION**

St. Louis encephalitis virus (SLEV) and Rocio virus are arthropodborne viruses (arboviruses) of the *Flavivirus* genus (family Flaviviridae) that can produce acute febrile illness and central nervous system (CNS) disease. SLEV was named after the first recognized outbreak in St. Louis, Missouri[.1](#page--1-0) Rocio virus was first isolated from a fatal case of encephalitis in the Rocio district in São Paulo, Brazil. The two viruses, which are closely related, are maintained in enzootic cycles between birds and mosquitoes and are transmitted to humans by infected mosquitoes. *Culex* species mosquitoes, which breed in dirty or stagnant water, are the most important vectors. Since it was first identified in the 1930s, SLEV has caused periodic outbreaks throughout the United States, although sporadic cases occur as well. In contrast, Rocio virus was first identified as the cause of an outbreak of encephalitis in Brazil in the 1970s and has rarely been detected since[.2](#page--1-1)

## **EPIDEMIOLOGY**

Transmission of SLEV and Rocio virus involves mosquito vectors and avian amplifying hosts. The geographic range of SLEV extends from southern Canada to Argentina, but human cases have been identified primarily in the United States. Most SLEV disease cases occur during the summer and early autumn. SLEV previously was the leading cause of arboviral encephalitis in the United States, causing periodic large outbreaks. From 1970 through the 1990s, these outbreaks primarily occurred in urban areas in the southeastern and central United States, with a more sporadic disease pattern in the Southwest.[1,3](#page--1-0) The largest outbreak of SLEV disease was in the central United States in 1975 and resulted in about 2000 reported neuroinvasive disease cases ([Fig. 38.6.1](#page-2-0)). Subsequent focal outbreaks of SLEV disease occurred in Florida in 1977 and 1990, Louisiana in 2001, and Argentina in 2005[.1,4–6](#page--1-0) However, after the identification of West Nile virus in the United States in 1999 and its subsequent spread across the country, SLEV disease incidence has decreased and few outbreaks have been reported. The most recent outbreak, with co-circulation of both SLEV and West Nile virus, occurred in Arizona in 2015 with 23 laboratoryconfirmed SLEV disease cases reported[.7](#page--1-2)

# **NATURAL HISTORY, PATHOGENESIS, AND PATHOLOGY**

Most infections with SLEV are asymptomatic[.1](#page--1-0) Although serologic surveys suggest that all age groups are at roughly equal risk of infection, clinical illness is more frequent and more severe in older age groups.[8,9](#page--1-3)

Between 1975 and 1977, over 1000 cases of Rocio virus disease were reported in São Paulo state, Brazil[.2](#page--1-1) Subsequently, only sporadic cases have been reported, although asymptomatic infections have been identified during serosurveys. To date, Rocio virus has not been detected outside of Brazil.

### **CLINICAL FEATURES**

The incubation period for SLEV is estimated to be 4 to 14 days. Aseptic meningitis and encephalitis are the most commonly described clinical syndromes after infection; non-specific febrile illness also occurs. SLEV meningitis is clinically similar to other viral meningitides, with clinical features including fever, headache, neck stiffness, and other meningeal signs. Cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) shows a moderately elevated white cell count and protein. Outcome is generally favorable. Encephalitis caused by SLEV infection may result in altered mental status, ataxia, tremors, seizures, or other neurologic signs. The syndrome of inappropriate secretion of antidiuretic hormone causing hyponatremia has been described[.10](#page--1-4) Mortality after SLEV encephalitis ranges from 5% to 20%; the case-fatality rate is higher in older age groups.

Clinical illness from Rocio virus is essentially the same as that described for SLEV. The Rocio virus outbreak in 1975 to 1977 was associated with severe illness observed both in younger children and older individuals.

# **PATIENT EVALUATION, DIAGNOSIS, AND DIFFERENTIAL DIAGNOSIS**

SLEV infection should be considered in patients with fever, aseptic meningitis, or encephalitis in the setting of known SLEV transmission, or during the appropriate season in endemic areas. In patients presenting with signs of meningitis or encephalitis, CSF examination should be performed to exclude bacterial meningitis and assess for CNS inflammation. Patients also should be evaluated for possible metabolic causes of acute encephalopathy and other common viral etiologies of acute encephalitis, such as herpes simplex virus. As SLEV and West Nile virus co-circulate in largely the same areas and are clinically nearly identical, both viruses should be considered in tandem.

Laboratory confirmation of SLEV infection is most commonly made by detection of virus-specific immunoglobulin (Ig) M antibodies by immunoassay in acute serum or CSF, or demonstration of a fourfold or greater rise in SLEV neutralizing antibodies between acute- and convalescent-phase serum specimens collected 2 to 3 weeks apart. Antibodies to SLEV and Rocio virus may be cross-reactive with those against closely related flaviviruses (e.g., West Nile and dengue viruses) or flavivirus vaccines (e.g., yellow fever and Japanese encephalitis vaccines)[.11](#page--1-5) In these situations, plaque-reduction neutralization testing may help discriminate between cross-reacting antibodies. Viral culture or SLEV-specific polymerase chain reaction testing may be performed on acute-phase serum, CSF, or tissue, but the sensitivity is low.
