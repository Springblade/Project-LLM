- • Care for people with HIV in low- and middle-income countries should include:
  - • Isoniazid preventive therapy to reduce the risk of tuberculosis

- • Measures to prevent malaria in settings of stable malarial transmission.
- • Measures to minimize the risk of tuberculosis transmission are essential in health care facilities providing care for people with HIV.
- • HIV increases clinical episodes of malaria and their severity, including worse outcomes in pregnant women.

# **HIV AND TUBERCULOSIS**

## **The Effect of HIV on Tuberculosis**

The HIV epidemic is the main cause of the global resurgence of tuberculosis since the 1980s, with southern Africa most severely affected by the dual epidemic, such that in several countries more than half of people who have active tuberculosis are HIV-positive. HIV infection increases the risk of active tuberculosis by at least 20-fold.[1](#page-3-0) HIV-positive people are more likely to progress to active tuberculosis after recent tuberculosis infection and are more likely to reactivate latent tuberculosis. People with tuberculosis are more likely to die if they are HIV-positive, particularly if they are not taking antiretroviral therapy,[2](#page-3-1) underlining the importance of coordinated management of both diseases.

The clinical presentation of tuberculosis is altered in HIVpositive people, making it harder to diagnose clinically because manifestations may be atypical and more subtle. HIV-positive people with pulmonary tuberculosis are less likely to have upper lobe disease or to have cavitation, particularly if they have advanced immunosuppression. They can have atypical radiographic appearances of interstitial infiltrates or lymphadenopathy; they can also have normal chest radiographs, even in the presence of bacteriologically positive disease. HIV-positive people are more likely to have extrapulmonary (for example, pleural or pericardial) and disseminated tuberculosis.

HIV infection further complicates the management of tuberculosis by making laboratory diagnosis more difficult. HIV-positive people with pulmonary tuberculosis are likely to have a lower concentration of bacilli in sputum, reducing the sensitivity of tests based on bacteriologic detection. This presents problems in many low- and middle-income countries where sputum smear microscopy remains the only widely available diagnostic tool. Xpert MTB/ RIF, an automated polymerase chain reaction–based assay that detects *Mycobacterium tuberculosis* and rifampin resistance within 2 hours with high specificity and sensitivity, is recommended by the World Health Organization (WHO) as the first-line test for HIV-positive people with symptoms suggesting tuberculosis ([Fig. 31.1.1](#page-1-0)). Similar test platforms, potentially usable in primary care settings, are in development. Currently, available lateral flow assays for urinary lipoarabinomannan, a glycolipid virulence factor associated with *M. tuberculosis,* have sub-optimal sensitivity and have a limited role for tuberculosis diagnosis among immunosuppressed hospitalized and sick HIV-positive patients. Sputum culture, particularly using liquid culture media, is the most sensitive bacteriologic test; imaging appropriate to the clinical presentation is also useful where accessible.

Tuberculosis is a common cause of immune reconstitution disease, which may be classified as paradoxical (worsening of tuberculosis manifestations among people who start antiretroviral therapy when already on anti-tuberculosis treatment) or unmasking (disease that becomes clinically apparent after the start of antiretroviral therapy)[.3](#page-3-2)

The treatment of tuberculosis in HIV-positive people is, in principle, the same as for HIV-negative people. However, it is complicated by multiple drug–drug interactions, particularly between the key anti-tuberculous agent, rifampin, and protease inhibitors, non-nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitors, and integrase inhibitors (see <http://www.hiv-druginteractions.org/>). The WHO-recommended approach in low- and middle-income countries is to use standard rifampin-based anti-tuberculosis treatment along with an efavirenz-based antiretroviral regimen; dose adjustments may be needed with other regimens. Accumulating evidence supports initiation of antiretroviral therapy as soon as possible after the start of anti-tuberculous treatment; earlier antiretroviral therapy is associated with reduced mortality, which outweighs concerns about overlapping drug toxicities and the risk of morbidity caused by immune reconstitution syndrome. An exception is when tuberculosis involves the central nervous system.

HIV-positive people are more likely to experience recurrence of tuberculosis after successful treatment. Where tuberculosis is

common, studies using molecular epidemiology show that this is more often caused by re-infection than by relapse.

There is no clear evidence that HIV infection makes drugresistant tuberculosis more common. However, because HIVpositive people are more likely to progress rapidly to active tuberculosis after new infection, in settings where transmission of drug-resistant tuberculosis is frequent, HIV-positive people are likely to be disproportionately affected. This problem was illustrated in an outbreak of extensively drug-resistant tuberculosis linked to an HIV clinic in KwaZulu-Natal, South Africa[.4](#page-3-3)

#### **The Effect of Tuberculosis on HIV Disease**

Laboratory studies have been interpreted as suggesting that tuberculosis accelerates the progression of HIV disease. HIVpositive people with tuberculosis are at higher risk of death than their HIV-negative counterparts, particularly if antiretroviral treatment is delayed. However, epidemiologic studies from the pre-antiretroviral era indicate that after controlling for confounding factors, survival among HIV-positive people in settings of high and low prevalence of tuberculosis is similar, suggesting that tuberculosis is more likely to be a marker of HIV disease progression than a cause of it[.5](#page-3-4)

#### **Management Points**

- • All people diagnosed with, or under investigation for tuberculosis should know their HIV status.
- • People diagnosed with HIV-associated tuberculosis in low- and middle-income countries should take cotrimoxazole preventive therapy.
- • WHO guidelines recommend antiretroviral therapy for all HIV-positive people diagnosed with tuberculosis, starting as soon as possible after the start of anti-tuberculous therapy.
- • HIV-positive people entering or re-entering care should be screened for tuberculosis. In southern Africa, the prevalence of active tuberculosis among people presenting for HIV care is so high that investigation (preferably with a high-sensitivity test such as Xpert MTB/RIF) should be considered for all. A symptom screen for tuberculosis (cough, fever, night sweats, weight loss) should be part of every clinical encounter.
- • Sputum microscopy for acid-fast bacilli is less sensitive among HIV-positive people; more sensitive tests, such as molecular testing or culture, should be used, if available. Imaging may be useful if initial bacteriologic tests are negative.
- • Isoniazid preventive therapy reduces the risk of developing tuberculosis and should be part of the package of care for HIV-positive people. Effective antiretroviral therapy also reduces the risk of tuberculosis.
- • Measures to minimize the risk of tuberculosis transmission are essential in health care settings serving HIV-positive people.

#### **HIV AND MALARIA**

# **The Effect of HIV on Malaria**

Mathematical modeling suggests that in southern Africa, HIV may have contributed to an increase in episodes of clinical malaria by up to 28%. In areas of stable malaria transmission, HIV-positive pregnant women are more likely than their HIV-negative counterparts to have clinical malaria, higher parasitemia, anemia, and placental parasitemia leading to adverse birth outcomes. Placental malaria has been associated with increased expression of CCR5, a co-receptor for HIV cell entry, in placental macrophages and an increase in maternal viral load. Data are conflicting concerning whether malaria during pregnancy increases the risk of HIV transmission to the fetus.

In settings of stable malaria, HIV impairs acquired immunity to malaria among adults and older children such that they are more likely to have asymptomatic parasitemia and clinical malaria that is proportional to the degree of immunosuppression, particularly when the CD4 count is <350 cells/µL. Pregnant women, especially primigravidae, are also at risk of transient loss of acquired immunity. In settings of unstable malaria, non-immune HIV-positive adults are at higher risk of severe malaria and death[.6](#page-3-5)

HIV infection has been associated with an increased risk of failure of malaria treatment, although most studies used sub-optimal drug therapy, and recurrence may be caused by re-infection rather than re-crudescence.

In settings of stable malaria, the effect of co-trimoxazole preventive therapy in reducing morbidity results, in part, from a reduction in symptomatic malaria episodes.[7](#page-3-6) WHO guidelines recommend that co-trimoxazole preventive therapy can be discontinued among people who are stable on antiretroviral therapy in settings of low malaria prevalence but should be continued in malaria-prevalent areas. Co-trimoxazole preventive therapy has been associated with an increased risk of failure of anti-malarial treatment with sulfadoxine-pyrimethamine (which has a similar mechanism of action and of resistance). Some antiretroviral agents have anti-malarial activity; however, to date, there is no clear evidence that this has clinical relevance. There are potential interactions between anti-malarial and antiretroviral drugs, which require careful monitoring. For example, protease inhibitors and pharmacokinetic boosters can increase levels of quinine or lumefantrine, potentially increasing adverse effects. Efavirenz and amodiaquine should never be co-administered due to risk of significant transaminitis. Clinicians should be aware of overlapping toxicities; for example, artesunate and amodiaquine may cause neutropenia, as can older antiretroviral agents such as zidovudine as well as co-trimoxazole.

# **The Effect of Malaria on HIV**

HIV viral load has been noted to increase transiently after an episode of malaria in HIV-positive people not taking antiretroviral therapy; however, there is no clear evidence that this has clinical relevance. Malarial anemia, particularly among children, has indirectly contributed to HIV transmission via transfusion of unscreened, HIV-infected blood.

#### **Management Points**

- • In malarial areas, standard anti-malarial prevention measures, such as insecticide-treated bed nets, should be part of the package of care for HIV-positive people.
- • HIV-positive people who present with fever while taking cotrimoxazole preventive therapy are unlikely to have malaria and need further investigation; if malaria is diagnosed, sulfadoxine-pyrimethamine should not be used for treatment.
- • There are potential interactions between anti-malarial and antiretroviral drugs (see <http://www.hiv-druginteractions.org/>). Most specifically, people taking efavirenz should not be given amodiaquine, and people taking protease inhibitors should not take halofantrine or lumefantrine.
- • In settings of stable malaria, HIV-positive pregnant women should receive three doses of intermittent presumptive malaria treatment during pregnancy (rather than two) if they are not taking co-trimoxazole preventive therapy.

# **HIV AND** *STREPTOCOCCUS PNEUMONIAE*

# **Interactions**

HIV-positive people are at a greatly increased risk of pneumococcal disease.[8](#page-3-7) Pneumococcal disease can occur at any CD4 count but occurs more frequently and is more severe among those whose CD4 is lower or who have other co-morbidities; pneumonia is more common among smokers. The clinical presentation of pneumococcal pneumonia, with fever, chest pain, and cough, is similar in HIV-positive and -negative people; HIV-positive people are more likely to have pneumococcal bacteremia. HIV infection is also associated with pneumococcal meningitis; *Streptococcus pneumoniae* is the dominant cause of bacterial meningitis among people with HIV in southern Africa[9](#page-3-8) and has high mortality.

# **Management Points**

- • People with presumed/confirmed pneumococcal disease should be recommended to test for HIV.
- • In HIV-positive people who have suspected bacterial pneumonia, the possibility of underlying tuberculosis should be considered. In this case the empirical use of fluoroquinolones should be avoided in view of their anti-tuberculous activity, which may delay diagnosis and complicate treatment of tuberculosis.
- • Although the evidence supporting the efficacy of 23-valent polysaccharide pneumococcal vaccination for adults with HIV is weak, many guidelines recommend it—particularly for people with CD4 counts above 200 cells/µL. Newer conjugate pneumococcal vaccines may be more efficacious, but there are fewer serotypes in the conjugate vaccine. Pneumococcal conjugate vaccine is efficacious in both HIV-positive and HIV-negative children and is recommended: there is evidence that vaccination of children under 5 years of age provides protection for HIV-positive adults in the same household.
