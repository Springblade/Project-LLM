# **139.2** Plant Poisoning

*Hans Persson, Michael Eddleston*

#### KEY FEATURES

- • Ingestion of or contact with poisonous plants is common. However, serious plant poisoning is rare because most plant exposures are accidental, occurring in small children who eat only a small amount and require no treatment.
- • Intentional exposures may be with suicidal intent (e.g., *Cascabela, Cerbera, Aconitum,* and *Colchicum* spp.) or involve psychotropic and hallucinogenic plants that are abused as recreational drugs (e.g., *Datura* and *Cannabis* spp.).
- • Use of herbal medicines or foods containing plant toxins, for example, aconitine in China and cyanide (cassava) in Africa, may cause severe poisoning. Food insecurity increases the risk of plant poisoning in food in vulnerable populations.
- • Treatment involves careful decontamination and symptomatic and supportive care.
- • Specific antidotes are available for poisoning by plants containing belladonna alkaloids, cardiac glycosides, and cyanogenic agents.

### **INTRODUCTION**

Accidental exposure to plants is common in small children, due to their curiosity and habit of testing things by putting them into the mouth. However, the amount swallowed is usually trivial, and serious plant poisoning is therefore uncommon in small children[.1](#page-3-0) More commonly, toxic plants may be mistaken for edible ones and prepared as food that causes poisoning in both adults and children. Food insecurity, forcing people to eat or prepare food in atypical ways, increases the risk of food poisoning.[2](#page-3-1)

Another cause of significant plant poisoning is deliberate ingestion of plants whose toxins have psychotropic and hallucinogenic properties, such as belladonna alkaloids (e.g., in *Datura* spp.) [\(Fig. 139.2.1](#page-0-0)), tetrahydrocannabinols (in *Cannabis sativa*), or mescaline (in *Lophophora williamsii*). Toxic plants are also used as suicidal agents. In South India and Sri Lanka, yellow oleander (*Cascabela thevetia*) seeds are commonly chosen for self-harm.[3](#page-3-2)

Treatment of plant poisoning involves decontamination, symptomatic care, and administration of antidotes, such as physostigmine for belladonna alkaloids, digitalis-specific antibodies for cardiac glycosides, and hydroxocobalamin or sodium thiosulphate for cyanogenic plant toxins.

# **SPECIFIC PLANT POISONINGS** ([BOX 139.2.1\)](#page-0-1)

### **Gastrointestinal Irritants**

Ingestion of many plants may cause gastroenteritic symptoms (abdominal colic, vomiting, and diarrhea) as the sole toxic manifestation. Oxalic acid and calcium oxalate crystals occur in many popular decorative plants, such as dumb cane (*Dieffenbachia* spp.), elephant's ear (*Philodenron* spp.), and cuckoo pint (*Arum maculatum*). The crystals cause intense irritation of mucous membranes in the mouth, esophagus, stomach, and intestine. Increased salivation, reddening,

blistering, and dysphagia may ensue. Other decorative plants, for example, *Euphorbia* and *Daphne* spp., contain highly irritating diterpene esters that cause burning sensations and pain in the mucous membranes of the gastrointestinal tract, particularly in the oropharynx. Some of these toxins may also cause skin lesions and in large amounts acute kidney injury.

Treatment is with oral fluids to rinse and dilute the irritant material, together with symptomatic care as required.

#### **Skin Lesions**

*Dieffenbachia* and *Euphorbia* spp. are irritating to skin, with dermatitis developing in people who handle these plants frequently. Hypersensitivity reactions may follow exposure to certain plants, for example, poison ivy (*Rhus radicans*), western poison oak (*Toxicodendron diversilobum*), and poison primrose (*Primula obconica*). Treatment is by rinsing the skin with water and symptomatic care.

More dramatic reactions occur after exposure to plants containing phototoxic psoralens, such as giant hogweed and other *Heracleum* spp., rue (*Ruta graveolens*), and the gas plant (*Dictamnus albus*). Skin that is contaminated with sap from these plants and subsequently exposed to sunlight may develop a nasty phototoxic reaction involving eczematous skin lesions and extensive, painful bullae. To prevent this reaction, exposed skin should be irrigated immediately and sunlight avoided. Established injuries are treated as chemical burns.

#### **NEUROTOXIC PLANTS**

### **Belladonna Alkaloids**

Belladonna alkaloids have long been used in clinical medicine to reduce gastric acid secretion, as spasmolytics, and to treat bradycardia and cholinergic poisoning. They occur in a number of plants, for example, deadly nightshade (*Atropa belladonna*) [\(Fig.](#page-1-0) [139.2.2](#page-1-0)), henbane (*Hyoscyamus niger*), thorn apple/jimsonweed (*Datura stramonium*), and angel's trumpet (*Brugmansia suaveolens*) (see [Fig. 139.2.1\)](#page-0-0). The alkaloids antagonize acetylcholine at muscarine receptors, resulting in both peripheral and central anti-cholinergic effects. Exposed patients may present with central nervous system (CNS) symptoms, such as anxiety and agitation, hallucinations, mydriasis, and fever. Peripheral symptoms include tachycardia, urinary retention, dry mouth, warm skin, and flushing. In severe exposure, seizures and coma may ensue.

Treatment is both specific and symptomatic. Sedation, preferably with benzodiazepines, is often effective, but large doses may be required. Physostigmine in a dose of 1 to 2 mg given slowly intravenously (IV) in adults (0.02–0.04 mg/kg slowly IV in children) will more specifically antagonize both central and peripheral anti-cholinergic symptoms.[4](#page--1-0) However, physostigmine should be withheld if cardiotoxic agents have been co-ingested, if the patient is bradycardic, or if a diagnostic electrocardiogram (ECG) reveals any conduction abnormalities.

Unilateral mydriasis may be an alarming clinical sign; however, it happens when people who handle anti-cholinergic plants rub their eye ("gardener's eye"). This has sometimes caused diagnostic confusion, resulting in expensive, but unnecessary, investigations.

#### **HALLUCINOGENIC PLANTS**

These plants are popular because of their strong hallucinogenic effects. Most important are tetrahydrocannabinols from cannabis (*C. sativa*), cathinone alkaloids in khat (*Catha edulis*), mescaline in peyote (*L. williamsii*), and myristicin in nutmeg (*Myristica fragrans*). Ingestion of the plant itself usually causes only moderate toxic exposure. Treatment is symptomatic.

#### **PLANTS CAUSING CONVULSIONS**

Cicutoxin and oenanthotoxin are potent gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA) antagonists that can produce recurrent convulsions. Cicutoxin occurs in *Cicuta virosa* (cowbane), *C. maculata* (water hemlock), and *C. douglasii* (western water hemlock), and oenanthotoxin occurs in *Oenanthe crocata* (hemlock water dropwort).

Severe poisoning with these plants has occurred in adults who have mistaken them for edible plants. The onset of symptoms is dramatic, with initial cholinergic symptoms, such as gastrointestinal upset, hypersalivation, and sweating, followed by recurrent, longlasting tonic-clonic convulsions. On arrival in hospital, patients may have hypoxia, severe metabolic acidosis, circulatory instability, joint dislocations, and rhabdomyolysis.

Treatment requires maximum symptomatic and supportive care in an intensive care unit. Emphasis should be put on stopping the convulsions, which may necessitate complete muscle relaxation and ventilator support.

Other plants that have been associated with convulsions include ackee fruit (*Blighia sapida*) ([Fig. 139.2.3](#page-1-1)) and chinaberry (*Melia azedarach*). Treatment is symptomatic and supportive.

### **PLANTS WITH NICOTINIC EFFECTS**

Some plants contain toxins that are agonists at nicotinic acetylcholine receptors and can cause respiratory failure in severe poisoning.[5](#page--1-1) The toxins include coniine in hemlock (*Conium maculatum*), nicotine in tobacco (*Nicotina tabacum*), anabasine in wild tobacco (*Nicotiana glauca*), and cytisine in blue wild indigo (*Baptisia australis*). Although their taste does stop many people from ingesting these plants, poisoning has occurred after mistaken identity. Symptoms are variable: salivation, nausea, vomiting, thirst, vision disturbances, sweating, and vertigo. In more severe poisoning, hypertension and tachycardia, followed by bradycardia and hypotension, muscle fasciculation, convulsions, muscular weakness, paralysis, and coma can occur. Deaths have resulted from respiratory failure. Treatment is symptomatic and supportive.

Nicotine-like effects have been reported from China and Hong Kong after ingestion of jessamine (*Gelsemium elegans*), which contains the toxins gelsemine and gelseminine. Cytisine, the toxic principal of *Laburnum* spp. (e.g., golden chain tree), may cause mild nicotine effects, but symptoms observed in children after ingestion of seeds are mostly vomiting and diarrhea. After heavy exposure, typical nicotine symptoms may occur, as noted earlier. Ingestion of *Lobelia* spp., many of which contain the nicotinic agonist lobeline, may cause similar symptoms.

### **CARDIOTOXIC PLANTS**

For **cardiac glycosides**, see [Chapter 139.3.](#page--1-2)

### **Aconitine**

*Aconitum* spp., such as *Aconitum napellus* (monkshood, wolfbane), *A. carmichaelli,* and *A. ferox* (roots used for the Nepalese arrow poison bikh), contain aconitine, one of the most potent plant toxins. Severe poisoning may occur through ingestion of herbal medicines containing aconitine and from deliberate ingestion of the plant for self-harm. These dreaded intoxications are not uncommon, and numerous fatalities have occurred.

Typically, burning and tingling sensations on the lips, in the mouth, and in the pharynx develop rapidly. Gastrointestinal and neurotoxic symptoms, including numbness and paresthesia in the limbs and hypersalivation, may develop. Life-threatening ventricular tachycardia and fibrillation often follow ventricular extrasystoles. These dysrhythmias are difficult to control, and the prognosis is poor. CNS depression and seizures are uncommon features.

Gastrointestinal decontamination should be attempted, even at a late stage. Treatment is symptomatic and supportive with careful use of anti-arrhythmic drug[s6](#page--1-3) ; extracorporeal life support may keep a severely poisoned patient alive until the toxins are eliminated.

### **Miscellaneous Cardiotoxic Plants**

Yew (*Taxus baccata*) and some other *Taxus* spp. contain toxic alkaloids that may exert significant cardiotoxicity; QRS widening, atrioventricular (AV) heart block, and fatal ventricular dysrhythmias have been observed. Veratrine (*Veratrum* and *Zigadenus* spp.) [\(Fig.](#page-2-0) [139.2.4\)](#page-2-0) is associated with digitalis-like effects. Cardiotoxic effects have also been associated with exposure to mountain laurel (*Kalmia latifolia*), *Menziesia* spp., *Rhodedendron* spp., and American mistletoe (*Phoradendron* spp.).

Ingestion of honey made from the nectar of rhododendron species growing near the Black Sea or in the Himalayas risks grayanotoxin poisoning[.7](#page--1-4) This toxin binds to voltage-gated sodium channels on nerves, muscle, and heart, preventing their inactivation. Cardiotoxicity is relatively mild, with bradycardia a common complaint; serious poisoning causes coma, respiratory depression, and, less commonly, ventricular dysrhythmias.

### <span id="page-2-0"></span>**CYTOTOXIC PLANTS**

These plant toxins disturb cell metabolism, affecting mitosis and intracellular protein synthesis.

#### **Colchicine**

Colchicine is the principal toxin found in *Colchicum autumnale* (autumn crocus, meadow saffron) and *Gloriosa superba* (glory lily). It has anti-mitotic effects, particularly affecting cells with rapid turnover, for example, intestinal mucosa and bone marrow, as well as heart, liver, and kidneys. Poisoning produces an initial phase of often severe gastrointestinal symptoms, particularly diarrhea, resulting in hypovolemia. Serious systemic features may follow with cardiac dysrhythmias, CNS depression and seizures, and liver and kidney injury. If the patient survives, bone marrow depression and hair loss may occur.

Apart from attempts to reduce absorption, treatment aims to provide adequate rehydration and supportive care, as well as enhancing elimination with multiple-dose activated charcoal. In cases of impaired bone marrow function, administration of granulocyte colony-stimulating factor (G-CSF) has proven useful. Colchicine-specific antibodies have been developed but are not yet commercially available.

### **Toxalbumins**

The toxalbumins ricin and abrin are water-soluble proteins that block protein synthesis, causing cell death, particularly of cells lining the gastrointestinal tract. They occur in *Ricinus communis* (castor oil plant or castor bean) ([Figs. 139.2.5](#page-3-3) and [139.2.6](#page-3-4)) and *Abrus precatorius* (jequirity or rosary bean—often threaded into attractive bracelets) (see [Fig. 139.2.6\)](#page-3-4). The toxins cause severe gastroenteritis with extensive fluid and electrolyte loss, with secondary renal and hepatic damage. Treatment is symptomatic and

## **Cyanogenic Glycosides**

More than 25 different cyanogenic glycosides occur in over 2500 species of plants. The glucosides and their hydrolyzing β-glucosidase enzymes are compartmentalized in intact plant tissue to prevent large-scale hydrolysis. When edible parts of the plants are chewed, they come into contact and cyanide release results.

The glycosides exist in the kernels of multiple *Prunus* spp. (e.g., almonds, apricots, cherries, apples, and peaches). Bitter almond varieties contain large amounts of glycosides, whereas sweet varieties are not toxic. Chewing and swallowing kernels or fruits of *Prunus* spp. may result in cyanide release in the stomach[.8](#page--1-5) This is a relatively slow process, and onset of symptoms is delayed in comparison with ingestion of cyanide salts or inhalation of hydrogen cyanide, where symptoms are either immediate (inhalation) or start in a few minutes (ingestion). Acute cyanide poisoning induced by plants is rare. Treatment is as for cyanide poisoning of any origin, providing supportive care and cyanide antidotes.

Cassava (*Manihot esculenta*), an important food crop in tropical countries, contains the cyanogenic glycosides linamarin and lotaustralin. Bitter and less bitter ("sweet") varieties exist; the former have 50-fold higher concentrations of glycosides than less bitter varieties. Thorough cooking removes most of the toxin, making it safe to eat. Ingestion of undercooked bitter cassava roots can cause acute cyanide poisoning (gastrointestinal symptoms after 30 minutes to hours) or, over a longer period, chronic cyanide poisoning aggravating iodine-deficiency cretinism and causing acute spastic paraparesis ("Konzo") in Tanzania and other East African countries, and tropical ataxic neuropathy in West Africa, Kerala, and other tropical regions.

#### **HEPATOTOXIC PLANTS**

Plants containing pyrrolizidine alkaloids cause chronic venoocclusive disease that gradually impairs liver function and, over time, cirrhosis. The alkaloids occur in certain *Heliotropium, Senecio, Crotalaria,* and *Symphytum* spp. Clinical cases have been reported from Jamaica, India, Afghanistan, and Central Asia. In the Farkhor region of Tajikistan during 1992, almost 4000 cases of hepatic veno-occlusive disease were noted over 5 months, with an attack rate of 4% and case fatality of 1.3%. It was later identified as being due to *Heliotropium lasiocarpum*–contaminated flour[.9](#page--1-6) In recent years, a number of widely distributed herbal medicines have been associated with hepatic toxicity.

*Senna occidentalis* is an invasive yellow-flowered toxic plant that contains anthraquinones and other toxins, particularly concentrated in seeds and roots. It is the probable cause of a pediatric acute hepatomyoencephalopathy syndrome that occurs regularly during autumn/winter months in India[.10](#page--1-7) Ingestion of unripe ackee (*Blighia sapida*) fruit produces Jamaican vomiting disease in West Africa and the Caribbean. Metabolites of the toxins hypoglycin A and B inhibit beta-oxidation of fatty acids, resulting in hypoglycemia, seizures, and coma.[11](#page--1-8) A somewhat similar syndrome has been described in children who developed nocturnal hypoglycemic encephalopathy after gorging on unripe lichi (lychee) (*Litchi chinensis*) fruits in Muzaffarpur, Bihar, India, attributed to methylenecyclopropylglycine and hypoglycin A metabolites[.12](#page--1-9) No specific treatments are available.

### **NEPHROTOXIC PLANTS**

Damage to the kidneys with a temporary decline in renal function is usually secondary to other features such as heavy fluid loss. Direct nephrotoxic effects may be observed after exposure to large amounts of the anthraquinone glycosides and oxalic acid in rhubarb (*Rheum rhabarbum*).

*Aristolochia* spp. (birthworts) contain aristolochic acids, which cause chronic kidney disease and urothelial cancer. Exposure has occurred from contamination of herbal medicines and from contamination with aristolochia plants of wheat fields harvested to make bread. *Cleistanthus collinus* is a tree that occurs in South Asia; in south India, its leaves are boiled and used for self-harm due to the presence of arylnaphthalene lignans, including cleistanthin A and B. The toxins cause a distal renal tubular acidosis, severe potassium loss in urine, and sometimes fatal cardiac dysrhythmias.[13](#page--1-10)

Spurge laurel (*Daphne laureda*), mezereon (*D. mezereum*), and savin (*Juniperus savina*) contain terpenes that are irritating and may cause blisters in mouth and gastrointestinal tract in addition to nephritis with hematuria and proteinuria.
