## **51.1** *Yersinia enterocolitica*

*Sonia Qureshi, Farah Naz Qamar*

### KEY FEATURES

- • *Yersinia enterocolitica* encompasses a heterogeneous collection of facultatively anaerobic gram-negative rods that belong to the family Enterobacteriaceae*. Y. enterocolitica* is found in dairy products, meats (e.g., pork and poultry), and vegetables.
- • The epidemiology of *Y. enterocolitica* infection is complex and remains poorly understood because most cases of yersiniosis are sporadic without an apparent source.
- • *Y. enterocolitica* is primarily associated with gastrointestinal disease but can cause extraintestinal infections in immunocompromised hosts, especially in conditions of iron overload.
- • Young adults may present with acute abdominal pain mimicking appendicitis (pseudo-appendicitis), and surgery may be inadvertently performed for suspected appendicitis.
- • Secondary immune-mediated sequelae, such as arthritis, glomerulonephritis, myocarditis, Reiter's syndrome, and erythema nodosum, can occur after *Y. enterocolitica* infection in individuals.
- • The diagnosis of yersiniosis is established by culture isolation from biological specimens.
- • Fluoroquinolone therapy can be used to treat individuals with severe enteritis. Cefotaxime and ceftriaxone alone, or in combination with aminoglycosides, are effective in the treatment of individuals with *Y. enterocolitica* bacteremia.
- • Safe food processing and preparation and handwashing after exposure to pigs or raw pork products, as well as avoiding consumption of raw pork, are important preventive measures.

#### **INTRODUCTION**

*Yersinia enterocolitica* is an important foodborne organism with worldwide distribution. It is a facultative, non–lactose-fermenting, gram-negative rod belonging to the family Enterobacteriaceae and is a member of the genus *Yersinia*. Within this genus, there are total of 11 species and only 3 (*Y. pestis, Y. pseudotuberculosis,* and *Y. enterocolitica*) are regarded as pathogenic for humans.[1](#page-1-0) The pathogen has the capacity to grow in both aerobic and anaerobic conditions. As *Y. enterocolitica* has the ability to multiply under extreme environmental conditions, it is well adapted to survival in cooler temperate zones as well as in microaerophilic environments, including aquatic environments. It is motile at 25°C but non-motile at 37°C[.2,3](#page-1-1) *Y. enterocolitica* is not able to grow at pH <4.2 or >9.0, or at salt concentrations greater than 7%[.4](#page-1-2) *Y. enterocolitica* lacks a siderophore, and growth is enhanced in the presence of a heme-rich environment with high concentrations of iron. The organism primarily causes gastrointestinal disease but can cause extraintestinal infections, particularly in immunocompromised hosts and in conditions associated with iron overload.

#### **EPIDEMIOLOGY**

*Y. enterocolitica* was discovered more than 60 years ago but was not considered a human or veterinary pathogen until the late 1960s when it became progressively recognized in foodborne gastrointestinal infections.[2](#page-1-1) The epidemiology of *Y. enterocolitica* infections is complex and remains poorly understood because most cases are sporadic without an apparent source. The incidence of *Y. enterocolitica* foodborne infection varies according to geography and climate. Chakraborty et al. analyzed the surveillance data from nine U.S. states during the period of 2005–2011 and found differences in the epidemiology of yersiniosis by race and also reported seasonality among African Americans and white populations[.5](#page-1-3) *Y. enterocolitica*–associated gastroenteritis is reported worldwide, most commonly from northern European countries. The infection is rarely reported from tropical regions[.3](#page-1-4) The natural reservoir of *Y. enterocolitica* is the intestinal tracts of farm animals, especially pigs, cows, and goats. The bacteria can also be isolated from the feces of dogs and cats. There are over 60 serogroups of *Y. enterocolitica* but only 11 are implicated in human disease.

A major source of infection in humans is ingestion of raw or improperly cooked swine products, such as chitterlings (pig intestines). Person-to-person transmission is rare. However, contamination of food by infected food handlers has been reported. Nosocomial and foodborne outbreaks have also been described.[3,6](#page-1-4) In 1980s, two large foodborne outbreaks were reported in China; one was caused by beef contamination in 1986 in Lanzhou, Gansu Province and was caused by *Y. enterocolitica* O:3; the second occurred in a school in Shenyang, Liaoning Province and was caused by *Y. enterocolitica* O:8[.7,8](#page-1-5) In recent times McDonald et al. investigated one of the largest foodborne outbreaks in Norway in 2014, which was caused by consumption of mixed salad in the military and civilian populations.[9](#page-1-6)

#### **NATURAL HISTORY, PATHOGENESIS, AND PATHOLOGY**

Infection with *Y. enterocolitica* occurs after ingestion of contaminated food or water. *Yersinia* species have a marked tropism for lymphoid tissue, and bacteria migrate to the terminal ileum, where they adhere to M cells in the Peyer's patches and penetrate through these cells to colonize lymphoid follicles. Continued proliferation of bacteria in the lamina propria enables the bacteria to survive and spread to other organs, such as the liver, spleen, and mesenteric lymph nodes. Virulence is associated with three chromosomally encoded proteins (invasin, ail, and YadA) that promote adherence to (YadA) and invasion (invasin) of M cells. Additionally, several plasmid-mediated outer member proteins (Yops) act synergistically to block various steps in the phagocytic pathway. Non-pathogenic strains of *Yersinia* are Yops negative and are rapidly phagocytized.[10](#page--1-0) Virulence is also associated with a 70-kb virulence plasmid (pYV/ pCD) that is absent in avirulent strains, and by production of heat-stable enterotoxin controlled by chromosomal genes *ystA, ystB,* and *ystC*.

An association of *Y. enterolitica* sepsis in patients with hematologic dyscrasias, such as thalassemia or aplastic anemia requiring frequent transfusions and deferoxamine as an iron-chelating agent, is well established. This propensity is related to the ability of *Y. enterocolitica* to use ferrioxamine as a growth factor[.12](#page--1-2)

#### **CLINICAL FEATURES**

#### **Gastroenteritis**

*Y. enterocolitica* can cause illness ranging from acute watery diarrhea or dysentery to fatal necrotizing enterocolitis. Infection is more common in children and often associated with fever and vomiting[.13](#page--1-3) The illness may last for 3 to 28 days. Exposure to the small intestines of pigs, especially when steamed or fried for food (also known as *chitterlings* or *chitlins*), has been associated with a high risk of *Y. enterocolitica* enteritis in children. Infants younger than 3 months old are at risk of developing bacteremia and sepsis. Infections with serogroup O:8 may be severe and can cause extensive ulceration of the gastrointestinal tract and death. In young adults, *Y. enterolitica* infection can present with acute terminal ileitis and mesenteric lymphadenitis mimicking other diseases such as appendicitis (pseudo-appendicitis) or inflammatory bowel disease (IBD), often delaying diagnosis and treatment[.14,15](#page--1-4) Surgery may be inadvertently performed for suspected appendicitis. Infected individuals may shed *Y. enterocolitica* in stools for weeks after resolution of symptoms. Treatment with antibiotics shortens the duration of bacterial shedding.[16](#page--1-5)

#### **Septicemia**

Septicemia is reported in patients with predisposing conditions, such as alcoholism, diabetes mellitus, immune deficiency, and iron overload. Invasion of the bloodstream may result in abscess formation in the liver or spleen, pneumonia, septic arthritis, meningitis, panophthalmitis, osteomyelitis, and endocarditis, or localize in a major blood vessel leading to a mycotic aneurysm. Occasionally, sepsis may be acquired through transfusion of contaminated blood that has been stored for long periods[.17–19](#page--1-6)

#### **Post-Infectious Sequelae**

*Y. enterocolitica* can cause post-infectious inflammatory conditions, such as reactive arthritis. Individuals with the HLA-B27 haplotype are particularly susceptible and can develop arthritis, Reiter's syndrome, glomerulonephritis, myocarditis, and erythema nodosum after *Y. enterocolitica* infection. Joint symptoms occur in up to 2% of patients, usually 1 to 2 weeks after gastrointestinal illness. The large joints of the lower extremities are most commonly involved, and symptoms usually persist for 1 to 4 months, although prolonged syndromes can occur. Erythema nodosum manifests as painful, raised, red or purple lesions on the lower extremities within 3 weeks of infection and usually resolves spontaneously.[19–21](#page--1-7)

#### **MISCELLANEOUS INFECTIONS**

*Y. enterocolitica* has rarely been reported to cause urinary tract infections, conjunctivitis, localized skin abscess, intussusception, and appendicitis. Pharyngitis after oral ingestion of the organism has also been reported.

#### **DIAGNOSIS**

Definitive diagnosis usually rests on isolating the organism from stool, blood, or other specimens, including mesenteric lymph nodes, pharyngeal exudates, peritoneal fluid, synovial fluid, urine, or bile[.21](#page--1-8) It is important to notify laboratory personnel when yersiniosis is suspected because many laboratories do not routinely test for *Yersinia*. *Y. enterocolitica* grow as small, non–lactose-fermenting colonies on MacConkey agar kept at 25°C for 48 hours. Growth can be enhanced by use of differential agar such as cefsulodinirgasan novobiocin (CIN) agar, as well as cold enrichment techniques. High levels of antibodies to *Yersinia* may be helpful in the diagnosis of post-infectious complications. In regions where the background seroprevalence to *Yersinia* antigens is high, serologic findings must be interpreted with caution[.22](#page--1-9) Ultrasound or computed tomography (CT) scanning may be useful in differentiating *Yersinia* mesenteric adenitis from acute appendicitis.[21](#page--1-8)

#### **TREATMENT**

*Y. enterocolitica* are usually susceptible to cotrimoxazole, fluoroquinolone, aminoglycosides, chloramphenicol, third-generation cephalosporins, aztreonam, and imipenem. Cefotaxime and ceftriaxone are the most active third-generation cephalosporins against *Y. enterocolitica.*

Use of antibiotics in uncomplicated enteritis is controversial; hydration is the mainstay of therapy. Antibiotics are indicated in immunocompromised individuals to prevent or mitigate bacteremia and sepsis. For severe gastrointestinal infections, doxycycline and aminoglycoside (in combination) or fluoroquinolone therapy is indicated. Antimotility agents are contraindicated in the treatment of *Y. enterocolitica* enteritis. Cefotaxime and ceftriaxone, alone or in combination with aminoglycosides, are effective in the treatment of *Y. enterocolitica* bacteremia. Deferoxamine therapy should be discontinued during treatment of *Yersinia* bacteremia.[23–25](#page--1-10)

#### **PREVENTION AND CONTROL**

Avoidance of contact with excreta from pigs or domestic pets, well-controlled pasteurization of milk, provision of safe drinking water, and good hygiene practices at all stages of food production and processing may reduce the risk of *Y. enterocolitica* infection.[4](#page-1-2)
