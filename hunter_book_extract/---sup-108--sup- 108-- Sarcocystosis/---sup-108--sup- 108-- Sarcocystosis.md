# **<sup>108</sup> 108** Sarcocystosis

*Benjamin M. Rosenthal*

## KEY FEATURES

- • *Sarcocystis* parasites are a rare cause of eosinophilic enteritis, subcutaneous nodules, and eosinophilic myositis.
- • Humans are definitive hosts for *Sarcocystis hominis* and *S. suihominis,* the agents responsible for intestinal sarcocystosis. Ingesting sarcocysts found in uncooked or undercooked beef or pork may cause mild enteritis, but most infections are thought to be asymptomatic.
- • Humans may also become dead-end (intermediate) hosts for non-human *Sarcocystis* spp. after the accidental ingestion of oocysts. This ingestion leads to muscular sarcocystosis, a clinical spectrum ranging from asymptomatic muscle cysts to a severe, acute, eosinophilic myositis associated with systemic symptoms with peripheral eosinophilia.
- • Most human cases have been described from Southeast Asia, but *Sarcocystis* parasites have a worldwide distribution, especially where livestock is raised, and human infections in other areas have been described but may be underrecognized.

### **TRANSMISSION AND EPIDEMIOLOGY**

Humans are the definitive hosts when they consume undercooked pork or beef containing tissue cysts (sarcocysts) ([Fig. 108.1\)](#page-1-0) of the two recognized human species, *Sarcocystis hominis* and *S. suihominis,* and they develop intestinal sarcocystosis—a transient infection restricted to the gastrointestinal tract.

The vast majority of over 100 different parasite species are found in other mammals. In nature, carnivores acquire infection by consuming prey whose tissues harbor encysted parasites. The carnivores excrete the parasite oocysts, which are then consumed by herbivores ingesting contaminated vegetation or water. Humans are accidental intermediate hosts for several other *Sarcocystis* species.

*Sarcocystis* parasites have a worldwide distribution. Our understanding of the epidemiology of human sarcocystosis relies on sporadic case reports and occasional outbreaks, mostly described from Southeast Asia, especially Malaysia and Thailand. Limited seroprevalence studies and stool surveys confirm widespread distribution and exposures, and suggest human infections are likely underrecognized[.1](#page-2-0) Incidental findings at autopsy suggest widespread infection in endemic areas. One series of 100 consecutive, routine autopsies from Malaysia documented evidence of sarcocystosis in 21% of muscle tissue examinations[.2](#page-3-0) In Iran, sporocysts of *Sarcocystis* were identified (alone or in conjunction with other parasites) in 4 of over 2000 undiagnosed cases of abdominal distress, attesting to the concerted effort that will be required to clearly understand the prevalence and clinical significance of *Sarcocystis* in a population.[3](#page-3-1)

*S. nesbitti,* a parasite initially described from tissue cysts in rhesus macaques[,4,5](#page-3-2) was subsequently suspected of having predatory snakes as definitive hosts, on the basis of phylogenetic analyses[.6](#page-3-3) That hypothesis was confirmed after large outbreaks of human infection were attributed to *S. nesbitti*[7,8](#page-3-4) and engendered a search for such parasites in endemic snakes[9](#page-3-5) and in water sources vulnerable to contamination with their feces.[10](#page-3-6) More recently, a toxin isolated from *S. fayeri* has been suggested as a cause for food poisoning in people who have consumed raw horsemeat[.11](#page-3-7)

#### **PATHOGENESIS**

*Sarcocystis* parasites are obligatory, two-host, intra-cellular, intestinal, coccidian parasites. *S. hominis* and *S. suihominis* use humans as definitive hosts and are responsible for intestinal sarcocystosis in the human host. Humans may also become dead-end hosts for non-human *Sarcocystis* spp. after the accidental ingestion of oocysts.

Both sporulated oocysts (containing two sporocysts) and individual sporocysts can be passed in stool. Sporocysts contain four sporozoites and a refractile residual body. Sporocysts ingested by the intermediate host (cattle for *S. hominis* and pigs for *S. suihominis*) rupture, releasing sporozoites. Sporozoites enter endothelial cells of blood vessels and undergo schizogony, resulting in first-generation schizonts. Merozoites derived from the first generation invade small capillaries and blood vessels, becoming second-generation schizonts. The second-generation merozoites invade skeletal and heart myocytes, as well as neurons, and develop into metrocysts and undergo a series of internal mitotic divisions (endodyogeny). When filled with bradyzoites, the metrocyst becomes a sarcocyst ([Fig. 108.2A\)](#page-2-1) that will be infectious when eventually consumed by the definitive host. There is no evidence that rupture of sarcocysts in the intermediate host can initiate new rounds of replication in the intermediate host.

Much of our understanding of the pathogenesis of intestinal infection in humans comes from experiments infecting human volunteers with sarcocysts (although, arguably, unnaturally large numbers were ingested). Several days after exposure, and for several days thereafter, infected persons will excrete oocysts and infective sporocysts in the stool. Although people can experience lengthy, indeed lifelong, infection with sarcocysts, the identity and natural history of those parasites remain unknown. Excellent, illustrated reviews of zoonotic sarcocystosis are available[.12–14](#page-3-8) A single enzootic species (*S. neurona*) has been subjected to complete genome sequencing and may serve as a model to explore many aspects of biology and pathogenesis[.15](#page-3-9)

#### **CLINICAL MANIFESTATIONS**

Human disease can manifest as either an enteric infection or as a muscular infection ([Table 108.1\)](#page-1-1). Reviews of human *Sarcocystis* infections are available[.16–18](#page-3-10)

#### **Enteric Infection**

Most individuals with intestinal sarcocystosis remain asymptomatic or rarely recognized. Symptoms induced by experimental challenge include nausea, abdominal discomfort, and self-limited diarrhea, with symptom severity dependent on the amount of meat consumed.[13](#page-3-11) Onset of diarrhea is generally rapid (in some subjects 3–6 hours post-ingestion), normally within 48 hours of ingestion. Illness is typically brief and self-limited, usually resolving within 36 hours of onset. A segmental, eosinophilic, necrotizing enteritis attributed to sexual forms of *Sarcocystis* has been reported; however, causation in these cases was not definitely established.[19](#page-3-12) The intensity of symptoms may be related to the infectious dose of

### **Muscle Infection**

As with gastrointestinal involvement, muscular sarcocystosis is usually, but not always, asymptomatic. When humans ingest sporocysts, and thus become intermediate hosts, the release of meronts to the endothelium and subsequent merozoite invasion of striated muscle can correlate with vasculitic and/or musculoskeletal symptomatology. In an outbreak of eosinophilic myositis in a 15-man U.S. military unit operating in Malaysia, 7 out of 10 exposed personnel reported an acute illness consisting of fever, myalgias, bronchospasm, fleeting pruritic rashes, transient lymphadenopathy, and subcutaneous nodules associated with eosinophilia, elevated erythrocyte sedimentation rate, and elevated levels of hepatic enzymes and muscle creatinine kinase.[20](#page-3-13) One patient had serious, chronic sequelae; the other team members had milder, self-limited illnesses. Muscle tissue biopsy of the index case showed an unidentified *Sarcocystis* species. In a recent outbreak in Tioman Island, Malaysia, including 2 confirmed cases harboring tissue cysts of *S. nesbitti* with 91 other suspected cases, fever, myalgia, headache, and cough were the most frequent symptoms[.8,9,21](#page-3-14)

When cases are symptomatic, painful muscle swellings, measuring 1 to 3 cm in diameter and initially associated with erythema of the overlying skin, occur episodically and last from 2 days to 4 weeks. Sometimes, lesions are accompanied by fever, diffuse myalgia, muscle tenderness, weakness, eosinophilia, and bronchospasm. A discharging sinus, painful swelling with erythema, an ill-defined mass, and chronic pain with ulceration have been reported from New Zealand[.22](#page-3-15)

#### **DIAGNOSIS**

Sporulated sporocysts, each containing four sporozoites, and oocysts containing two sporocysts enclosed by a protective wall can be visualized microscopically in freshly voided stool specimens with the aid of flotation procedures [\(Fig. 108.2B](#page-2-1)). *Sarcocystis* oocysts resemble *Isospora* oocysts—they are acid-fast and contain two sporocysts. Generally, parasite species cannot be differentiated microscopically for clinical practice; however, variation in the 18S rDNA provides a basis to discriminate among excreted parasites[.23](#page-3-16) Oocysts measure 15 × 20 µm, and sporocysts measure 12 × 6 µm. Due to the fragile nature of the oocyst wall, individual sporocysts may also be detected in stool. Infection can also be confirmed by visualizing trophozoites or bradyzoites in biopsy tissue.

Definitive diagnosis of *Sarcocystis* myositis is by muscle biopsy. Other muscle cyst-forming organisms, such as *Toxoplasma gondii* and *Trypanosoma cruzi,* must be excluded. Sarcocysts are septate, and the cell wall is distinct ultrastructurally. Bradyzoites of *Sarcocystis* and *T. gondii* are periodic acid–Schiff positive, but *T. cruzi* is not. Intact sarcocysts can measure up to 100 µm in diameter and 325 µm in length, but are more often in the 20 to 60 µm range and are not generally accompanied by an inflammatory reaction in the surrounding tissue. However, if pain is a major complaint, then mild inflammatory reactions are often seen[.22](#page-3-15)

In the absence of muscle biopsy, eosinophilia in the presence of a compatible clinical syndrome and epidemiologic exposure support a probable diagnosis, especially if other diagnoses can be excluded. Serology is difficult to obtain and of uncertain value. Seroprevalence of 10% to 20% has been described in adults in rural areas of Laos and Tibet[.24](#page-3-17)

#### **TREATMENT**

Because *Sarcocystis* organisms in muscle and intestine are fully formed, terminal stages in the host and parasites will not spread to new cells—treatment directed toward the muscle and enteric infection is unsatisfactory. Although various treatments have been used for symptomatic muscular infection (see [Table 108.1](#page-1-1)), none can be recommended, and no specific treatment for *Sarcocystis* infection has been described. Treatment is symptomatic and palliative corticosteroids should palliate episodic allergic inflammatory reactions after cyst rupture or to alleviate more chronic, systemic symptoms. Cotrimoxazole treatment, especially when initiated early, tended to shorten the duation of symptoms in a small cohort[.25](#page-3-18) Because the intra-cystic bradyzoites are not capable of infecting new cells in the host, there is no risk of recrudescence.

#### **PREVENTION**

Muscle involvement can be prevented by avoiding food and water that are potentially contaminated with feces of predatory carnivores. Boiling water will be preventive. Enteric infection can be prevented by avoiding ingestion of raw or undercooked beef and pork. Sporocysts are hardy, resisting treatment with bleach, chlorhexidine, and the iodophor Betadine[.26](#page-3-19) Most frozen (−20°C) or well-cooked meats are safe, however.

#### **PUBLIC HEALTH BURDEN**

The public health burden of human sarcocystosis remains unknown. Although veterinary data implicate immune suppression as a clinical risk factor for sarcocystosis, and although pregnancy and AIDS markedly exacerbate toxoplasmosis (caused by a closely related zoonotic parasite), less is currently known about how vulnerability to sarcocystosis may vary among individuals[.27](#page-3-20)

Intensive transmission should be limited to those who routinely consume uncooked meat and live where untreated human wastes routinely expose livestock to renewed exposure.[19](#page-3-12) Indeed, epidemics have been documented where such circumstances prevail. However, the population at risk for such infections has never been defined with certainty. Prevalent *S. hominis* in European cattle[,28](#page-3-21) but not in American cattle[,29](#page-3-22) suggests that geographic variation in risk may occur, even among developed countries. Emerging data substantiate that veterinary and human infections may elsewhere be more prevalent and consequential than generally imagined[.30](#page-3-23)
