# **152** Screening of the Asymptomatic Long-Term Traveler

*Catherine C. Smith, Vanessa K. Field*

## KEY FEATURES

- • Asymptomatic returning travelers may have been exposed to infectious pathogens while traveling. Screening aims to identify possible exposure to risks that may have implications for the health of an individual.
- • Asymptomatic returning travelers may harbor pathogens with high levels of antimicrobial resistance with implications for both their own health and the wider public health.
- • A sound knowledge of destination-specific risks, mode of acquisition and incubation periods of diseases, and utility of screening tests is necessary.
- • The clinician must make a risk assessment, including a detailed history, in order to assess the likelihood of exposure to infectious and non-infectious travel-associated risks and assess the magnitude and potential impact of that risk (e.g., exposure to schistosomula, sexually transmitted and blood-borne infections, tuberculosis, and malaria).
- • A physical examination and targeted testing according to exposure is recommended, with findings of eosinophilia necessitating specific evaluation.
- • Referral to a specialist center is essential for those clinicians with little or no experience of managing returned travelers.

## **INTRODUCTION**

The long-term traveler can be defined as those traveling or residing overseas for more than 6 months and includes those going on extended holidays (gap year/backpackers/visiting friends and relatives) and those residing overseas in order to work or volunteer (expatriates). The type and extent of risk to the health of long-term travelers, and the screening of them on return, vary considerably according to the individual, their destinations, duration, and purpose of travel[.1](#page-3-0)

Screening of travelers is a medical review undertaken to identify risks to which they may have been exposed that may have implications for their health. Screening may be diagnostic or can lead to more extensive evaluation. There are few data and no uniformly accepted guidelines or extensive cost/benefit analyses for screening of the asymptomatic long-term traveler.

Asymptomatic travelers may have latent disease (HIV, tuberculosis [TB]), dormant pathogens (*Plasmodium vivax* or *P. ovale* malaria[\)2,3](#page-3-1) or pre-clinical disease (they may be within the incubation period, infected but not yet symptomatic). They may be carriers of pathogens, having recovered from an episode of illness while traveling (e.g., typhoid) or have been colonized by highly antibioticresistant pathogens such as ESBL-PE– or NDM-1–producing *Klebsiella pneumoniae*. [4,5](#page-3-2) Primary infections may be mild or asymptomatic (e.g., Zika virus[,6](#page-4-0) hepatitis B or C), so may have been missed.

When assessing the asymptomatic returning traveler, the focus should be on the infections with the highest negative impact (HIV, schistosomiasis) and those that can be detected reliably and relatively cheaply (stool tests for gastrointestinal pathogens)[.7](#page-4-1)

Returned travelers should be made aware of the purpose and limitations of the post-travel check. They should be informed that screening tests can reliably detect only certain infections and that important pathogens, such as dormant liver forms (hypnozoites) of *P. vivax* malaria, cannot be excluded. Tests relying on antibody detection (schistosomiasis, HIV) may not become positive for weeks or months after infection. A test carried out too soon may yield a false-negative result. Returning travelers must understand that if symptoms develop in the 6 to 12 months after travel, they should seek medical advice and provide their travel history.

A post-travel consultation is an opportunity to:

- 1. Discuss exposure to infectious disease risks and assess the necessity for and timing of screening.
- 2. Target investigations of latent infections that may have deleterious consequences if unrecognized.
- 3. Counsel the traveler in order to reduce the risk of secondary transmission of infections (e.g., TB, salmonellosis, scabies, and HIV).
- 4. Inform the traveler of potential disease manifestations that can occur at a later stage (e.g., *P. vivax* malaria) and consider presumptive treatment strategies.
- 5. Offer reassurance and/or confirm diagnosis or proof of cure after illness, such as febrile systemic illness, diarrheal disease, or rash that occurred during travel.
- 6. Provide information about the consequence of any illness during travel in view of future travel (e.g., dengue).
- 7. Review a traveler's compliance with preventive measures, including their experience of malaria chemoprophylaxis, and review their vaccination status.
- 8. Provide a lifestyle assessment—diet, exercise, alcohol, smoking, body mass index, stress.
- 9. Review pre-existing medical conditions and medications; provide a cardiovascular, neoplastic (cervical, breast, prostate, colon), and psychological review.
- 10. Where relevant, assess for an employer whether a traveler has returned in good health from an overseas assignment.

Referral to a specialist center for advice and management is essential for those clinicians with little or no experience of managing returned travelers. A sound knowledge of destination-specific risks, mode of acquisition and incubation periods of diseases, and the sensitivity and specificity of screening tests is necessary.

## **HOW DOES A CLINICIAN EVALUATE AN ASYMPTOMATIC LONG-TERM TRAVELER ON RETURN?**

## **History**

History is the cornerstone of the post-travel consultation. The clinician must take a detailed history in order to assess the likelihood of exposure to infectious and non-infectious travelassociated risks and assess the magnitude and potential impact of that risk.[1](#page-3-0)

The clinician should ask: "What might this person who has traveled to this destination been exposed to that may cause them ill health at some time?". They must consider:

- • *Person* age, gender, socio-economic status (including immigrant/ refugee status), occupation, sexual orientation, travel experience/ knowledge, personal risk profile (risk aversion/perception), pre-existing health conditions (including medication), pre-travel preparation (vaccinations, chemoprophylaxis), compliance during travel with pre-travel advice, any illness during travel, and any treatment received.
- • *Place* exact destination, itinerary, season, accommodation, duration, and date of return. Diseases can be destination specific; for example, *Loa loa* is confined to equatorial regions of West Africa, tick typhus is a disease of the east and southern African savannah, and gastrointestinal and soil-transmitted infections are ubiquitous.
- • *Exposures* an exposure history should detail:
  - • Safety risks: threats experienced to personal safety.
  - • Environmental risks: exposures to altitude, sun, extremes of temperature, and specific environments, including soiltransmitted helminths (strongyloides, hookworm, other intestinal helminths), freshwater contact (schistosomiasis, leptospirosis), caves (histoplasmosis), game parks (trypanosomiasis), safari (African tick typhus), equatorial forest (loiasis, onchocerciasis), and marine environments (stings, coral infections/necrosis).
  - • Food- and water-borne risks: general hygiene measures, water access, ingestion of raw/undercooked meat/fish, and unpasteurized products (e.g., amebiasis, brucellosis, giardiasis, intestinal helminths).
  - • Vector-borne risks (including animals): measures taken to prevent insect exposures; bites/skin wounds received (e.g., malaria, filariasis, trypanosomiasis, rabies).
  - • Airborne risks: close contact with people potentially infected with TB.
  - • Sexual health and blood-borne virus risks: unprotected contact and potential exposure to HIV, hepatitis B and C, and other sexually transmitted infections.
  - • Skin health: skin wounds, Ultra-violet damage, rash, and any symptoms such as itch.
  - • Psychological health: positive and negative experiences of travel, readjustment issues, and any ongoing mental health concerns.

## **Examination**

In asymptomatic travelers, physical examination is often of limited value. However, examination may reveal previously undetected lymphadenopathy, hepatosplenomegaly, hypertension, cardiac/ pulmonary dysfunction, and skin disorders. A full examination is therefore necessary.

## **General Screening Tests**

The evidence for the cost-effectiveness or overall effectiveness of laboratory tests is largely lacking. Tests selected will depend on the purpose of the assessment. For those returning from an overseas assignment whose employers require a "clean bill of health," a wider range of non-targeted "routine" blood tests, including total blood count and differential, liver transaminases, blood urea, and creatinine levels, may be appropriate, as these can assess the general state of health of the traveler as well as those which may indicate infection, such as eosinophilia[.8,9](#page-4-2) Blood testing for targeted serologic markers may be required, based on exposure history (see later). Microscopic stool examination for ova, cysts, and parasites; a urine dip-stick; and, when appropriate, serologic testing and a terminal urine for schistosomiasis should be performed[.9,10](#page-4-3) Fasting blood glucose, lipids, thyroid function tests, and neoplastic markers (e.g., prostate-specific antigen [PSA]) are optional for those wanting a comprehensive health review ([Fig. 152.1](#page-2-0)).

## **Targeted Disease Evaluation**

## Eosinophilia

Eosinophilia can indicate parasitic infection with helminths, especially with nematodes, trematodes, or larval cestodes (see also Chapter 155). It is more marked when blood and tissue migration occurs, as in *Strongyloides stercoralis,* schistosomiasis, blood filariasis, and intestinal helminths (*Ascaris,* hookworm), but less so in lymphatic filariasis. Individuals with such infections may also have normal eosinophil counts.

Three stool examinations, together with parasite serologies for strongyloidiasis, schistosomiasis, and filariasis, are more sensitive (89%) than eosinophilia alone (27%)[.11](#page-4-4) The predictive value of eosinophilia is higher in travelers with particularly high eosinophil counts (absolute count >1000/mm3 ), and further workup of these individuals is justified.[8](#page-4-2)

## Schistosomiasis

Infection with *Schistosoma* spp. should be suspected in any traveler who has been in contact with potentially infected freshwater in endemic areas. Schistosomiasis has been reported after both short-ter[m12,13](#page-4-5) and long-term travel.[14,15](#page-4-6) Heavy parasite loads in travelers are rare and so late-stage disease manifestations are also rare. The cost-effectiveness of diagnosing an occult asymptomatic parasitic infection such as schistosomiasis is not known. Specialist referral should be considered.

Testing is recommended 2 to 4 months after last exposure in those who are asymptomatic ([Fig. 152.2](#page-3-3)). Stool and urine microscopy is an insensitive method of diagnosis. Rectal snip is more sensitive[16](#page-4-7) but has been largely superseded by schistosomal antibody testing, which is both sensitive and specific[,9](#page-4-3) with seroconversion usually occurring within 3 months (occasionally up to 1 year). The test should be repeated at 6 months if negative at 2 to 4 months and there is a strong exposure history. A positive test does not necessarily indicate active disease, as titers can remain detectable for many years after successful eradication. Schistosomal antigen tests may provide more reliable measures of active infection in the future.

## Sexual Health and HIV Screening

Sexual health screening in returned asymptomatic long-term travelers is an important part of the post-travel consultation, limiting secondary transmission, and reassuring the traveler. This is usually best carried out in a specialist sexual health clinic. Male travelers and those visiting friends and relatives are most at risk.[17](#page-4-8)

Screening for HIV, hepatitis B surface antigen, and hepatitis C core antibodies should be performed in those whose exposure history reveals risk factors, for example, needlestick injury, needle shared by intravenous drug users, receipt of blood/blood product, exposure to contaminated needle/syringe during medical/ dental treatment, or procedures in which contaminated instruments may have been used, such as during tattooing or body piercing.

HIV serologic testing is reliably specific and sensitive and can be routinely offered to any traveler with a history of sexual contact with a new partner[.18](#page-4-9) Individuals should be offered an HIV test after counseling and with informed consent, at the initial consultation, and again at 12 weeks post-exposure. A repeat test at 6 months

#### **Asymptomatic screening of the returned traveler**

#### **Assess necessity for screening:**

Was the traveler exposed to specific health risks whilst abroad?

Is there a need to alleviate the traveler's concerns?

Has there been an appropriate interval between presentation for screening and the end of the trip to allow detection of latent disease?

**Clinical history:** geography, activities, pre-travel immunizations, antimalarials, and compliance.

Are there specific disease exposures that may be asymptomatic, based on travel destination and activities?

**Health:** pre-existing health conditions, illness and treatment during travel, e.g. fever, diarrhea, rash

#### **Specific enquiries regarding risks:**

**Food and water** general hygiene: ingestion of raw meat or fish, and unpasteurized dairy products

**Fresh water contacts** e.g. schistosomiasis

**Soil contact** e.g. strongyloides, hookworm

**Visits to caves** e.g. histoplasmosis and rabies (rare)

**Sexual contact** and risks e.g. HIV, syphilis, chlamydia

**Blood-borne virus risks** (injuries, blood transfusions, tattoos, piercings) e.g. HIV, hepatitis B and C

**Healthcare worker** e.g. needle stick injury, clinical setting with high rates of TB

**Game parks and walking safari:** risk of ticks and tsetse fly bites, e.g. rickettsial infections and trypanosomiasis

**Equatorial forests:** onchocerciasis, loiasis in Central and West Africa

**Accommodation:** e.g. mud huts in South America (risk of *Trypanosomiasis cruzi* infection).

#### **Initial investigations:**

Full blood count

Urea and electrolytes, liver enzymes (C reactive protein) Urinalysis

Stool for ova and parasites

Schistosoma serology (if travel to risk areas in Africa)

**Tailor investigations based on clinical history Consider referral to specialist center**

may be recommended if initial tests are negative and there is a strong exposure history.

Syphilis (*Treponema pallidum*) serology, *Neisseria gonorrhoeae,* and *Chlamydia trachomatis* (direct urethral/cervical sampling or indirect urine sampling) should also be considered and an examination performed for warts, ulcers, and discharge.

## Trypanosomiasis

Serologic tests are sensitive for *Trypanosoma cruzi* (Chagas disease) and *T. brucei gambiense,* the two forms of trypanosomiasis that may be latent. Screening should be restricted to those travelers whose history suggests significant exposure, for example, poor housing in an area endemic in South America for triatomid bugs and *T. cruzi,* or exposure to tsetse fly in areas of Central and West Africa known for intense transmission of *T. brucei gambiense.* Guidelines have recently been published for management of latent Chagas disease.[19](#page-4-10)

## Tuberculosis

Although the incidence rates of TB infection in some long-term travelers are comparable to those of the indigenous populations[,20](#page-4-11) overall, the risk of acquiring TB infection in immunocompetent long-term travelers is low[.21](#page-4-12) Health care workers, those who visit friends and relatives, and children under the age of 5 years are likely to be at higher risk, some of them to multi-drug-resistant and extensively drug-resistant TB.[20,22](#page-4-11)

The American Thoracic Society recommends screening for TB in people likely to be recently infected, particularly those who have been in close contact with a known infectious case[.23](#page-4-13) Tuberculin testing (Mantoux, PPD) before and after exposure is recommended in this group. A change from a negative to a positive tuberculin skin test occurs 6 weeks to 4 months after TB exposure. Administration and interpretation of the test require expertise and timing. A more recent cost-effectiveness model proposed a single post-travel tuberculin skin test in people originally from

countries with a low incidence of TB.[24](#page-4-14) However, post travel interferon gamma release assay (IGRA) testing may be as effective as tuberculin testing and avoids the need for repeat visits to the clinic. A negative IGRA should be repeated at least 8 weeks after the last possible exposure[.21](#page-4-12) Testing is less reliable in those who are immunocompromised and in those previously vaccinated with bacille Calmette–Guérin (BCG).

A chest x-ray should be taken for those with a positive test. Post-exposure prophylactic treatment averts progression to active disease in most cases.

## Rabies Post-Exposure Prophylaxis

Long-term asymptomatic travelers should be asked of their potential for exposure to rabies and, if exposed, of any treatment received abroad, as well as their pre-exposure vaccine history. Inapparent exposure may have occurred, for example, in those working closely with mammals in endemic countries. Treatment received while traveling may have been inadequate[,25](#page-4-15) and rabies vaccine and IgG should be considered, depending on the exposure type and time.

## Malaria

Malaria may become symptomatic after the initial post-travel period, and so all returned travelers from malaria-endemic areas should be educated about non-specific symptoms and signs, especially fever, during the first few months after return. They should be advised to seek an early medical opinion and inform health professionals of their travel history should these symptoms occur. A history of previous febrile episodes while traveling should be sought, which may point to possible infections with *P. vivax* or *P. ovale* and the need for treatment to eradicate dormant liver forms (hypnozoites).

## **Psychological Health**

Psychological diagnoses were reported significantly more frequently in long-term travelers compared with short-term travelers[.15](#page-4-16) Long-term travelers may fail to make a successful transition to their country of posting or to their home country on return. The returnee may be hesitant to voice their concerns because of issues of confidentiality or fear of stigma/embarrassment. Debriefing sessions, time for rest and relaxation, and re-adjustment and readaptation should be encouraged[.25](#page-4-15)

## **CONCLUSIONS**

Screening of asymptomatic long-term travelers can offer valuable diagnoses, avoiding possible sequelae. All asymptomatic long-term travelers should consider a post-travel consultation on their return. This should include a detailed personal, travel, and exposure history and physical examination. Little additional testing need be done, except when indicated by risk. The post-travel consultation is also an opportunity to re-emphasize primary prevention messages and perform a general health review.
