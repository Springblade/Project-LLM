# **79** Leptospirosis

*Joseph M. Vinetz, George Watt*

### KEY FEATURES

- • Leptospirosis is a neglected emerging bacterial zoonosis endemic in impoverished regions of the tropics that is sporadically transmitted in developed countries.
- • Leptospirosis is a cause of morbidity and mortality.
- • Severe leptospirosis is characterized by refractory shock, pulmonary hemorrhage, jaundice, acute kidney injury, and a high mortality rate.
- • The pathogenesis of leptospirosis remains largely unexplained but probably is due to endothelial cell dysfunction, with key pathologic features being a paucity of histopathologic changes in organs despite marked functional impairment.
- • Actionable diagnostic confirmation is rarely available in areas where most disease transmission occurs.
- • Severe leptospirosis should be treated with parenteral penicillin or third-generation cephalosporins, whereas milder cases may be treated with oral doxycycline; other agents may also be effective.
- • There is no commercially available vaccine for use in humans, although prophylactic weekly doxycycline can be used to prevent disease among select at-risk populations and during outbreaks.

#### **INTRODUCTION**

Leptospirosis is a globally important bacterial zoonosis caused by pathogenic spirochetes of the genus *Leptospira,* with a conservatively estimated 1.05 million cases and 60,000 deaths annually.[1](#page-4-0) The pathogenesis remains largely unexplained today even though Weil published a clinical description of leptospirosis in 1886. In 1916 Inada isolated spirochetes in pure culture, subsequently delineated *Leptospira,* identified them as the etiologic agent of leptospirosis, and linked rats to disease transmission[.2](#page-4-1) The disease is of greatest public health importance in the tropics, where it is a disease both of agricultural worker[s3,4](#page-4-2) and residents of urban slums.[5,6](#page-4-3) Outbreaks superimposed on endemic disease activity are regularly linked to severe hurricane and flooding events throughout the world; notable examples have occurred in Brazil[,5](#page-4-3) Sri Lanka,[7](#page-4-4) the Philippines[,8](#page-4-5) and Thailand[.9](#page-4-6)

#### **EPIDEMIOLOGY**

Leptospirosis is caused by spirochetes of the genus *Leptospira.* This genus contains more than 35 species classified on the basis of comparative genomic analysi[s10,11](#page-4-7) and more than 300 serovars based on diverse agglutinating lipopolysaccharide antigens. Leptospires colonize proximal renal tubules of mammalian hosts and are shed in the urine. They can survive for several months in the environment under moist conditions, particularly in the presence of warmth (above 22°C) and neutral pH (pH 6.2–8.0). These conditions occur all year round in the tropics but only during the summer and autumn months in temperate climates. Roughly 160 animal species harbor organisms, but rodents are a particularly important reservoir. Carrier rates of over 50% have been measured in Norway rats, which shed massive numbers of organisms for life without showing clinical illness. Some serovars appear to be preferentially adapted to select mammalian hosts. For example, the serovar Icterohaemorrhagiae is primarily associated with the Norway rat, Canicola with dogs, and Pomona with swine and cattle. However, a particular host species may serve as a reservoir for one or more serovars, and a particular serovar may colonize different animal species.

Transmission of infection from animal to human usually occurs through contact with contaminated water or moist soil. Organisms enter humans through abrasions of the skin or through the mucosal surface of the eye, mouth, nasopharynx, or esophagus. Crowded cities that are flood-prone and have large rat populations provide ideal conditions for disease transmission. Escalating migration of the rural poor to urban slums is likely to further exacerbate the risks of leptospirosis transmission. An outbreak in Nicaragua in 1995[12](#page-4-8) and an urban epidemic in Salvador, Brazil, in 199[95](#page-4-3) were associated with particularly heavy rains and flooding. In 2009 two typhoons struck the Philippines and caused massive flooding[.8](#page-4-5) Leptospirosis was recognized as the most urgent threat to health in the aftermath of these typhoons. Special clinics to treat the disease were set up in evacuation centers, and an estimated 1.3 million flood survivors were given chemoprophylaxis, the efficacy of which was presumed but not demonstrated.

Intense exposure to leptospires has been documented in rice, sugar cane, and rubber plantation workers. Less frequently, leptospirosis is acquired by direct contact with the blood, urine, or tissues of infected animals. Epidemiologic patterns in the United States and UK have changed. Recreational exposure to freshwater (e.g., white water rafting, triathlons, sailing, water skiing) and animal contact at home are more common than occupational exposure as the chief sources of disease in industrialized areas other than slums.

Measuring incidence by active surveillance confirms that leptospirosis is surprisingly common. Antibody positivity rates of 37% have been recorded in rural Belize, 23% in Vietnam, and 18% in inner city Baltimore, Maryland.[13](#page-4-9) More than 2527 human cases and 13 deaths were reported for the first 9 months of 1999 by the Ministry of Public Health in Thailand. Human leptospirosis is an important disease in China, Southeast Asia, India, Africa, and South and Central America. It is also of significance in eastern and southern Europe, Australia, and New Zealand. In the United States, the disease is primarily of veterinary importance, with only 50 to 150 human cases reported annually.

# **NATURAL HISTORY, PATHOGENESIS, AND PATHOLOGY**

Infection may be asymptomatic, but 5% to 15% of cases are severe or fatal[.1](#page-4-0) Pathogenesis, particularly that of severe disease, remains poorly understood. Overall, severe pulmonary hemorrhage syndrome (SPHS) accompanied by refractory shock appears to be the most common cause of death in leptospirosis; oliguric renal failure without access to dialysis is also associated with fatal leptospirosis. It is unclear why renal failure predominates as the principal cause of death in some places, whereas pulmonary hemorrhage is the major cause in others, even where the most common infecting serovars are the same. There are only minor histopathologic changes in the kidneys and livers of patients with marked functional impairment of these organs. Patients who survive severe leptospirosis have complete recovery of hepatic and renal function, consistent with the lack of structural damage to these organs.

#### **CLINICAL FEATURES**

The most common clinical features of leptospirosis are summarized in [Table 79.1](#page-1-0). Subclinical infection is common, and less than 10% of symptomatic infections result in severe, icteric illness. Even relatively virulent serovars, such as Copenhageni/ Icterohaemorrhagiae, lead more often to anicteric than to icteric disease. Old terms such as peapicker's disease, swineherd's disease, and canicola fever, which are linked to specific serotypes with distinct disease manifestations, are misleading and should be abandoned. The median incubation period is 10 days, with a range of 2 to 26 days. The duration of the incubation period has no prognostic significance. Once symptoms develop, they may or may not follow a biphasic course; after an initial febrile illness there is defervescence and symptomatic improvement followed by a second period of disease refractory to antibiotics. However, a clear demarcation between the first and second stages may not be observed in icteric leptospirosis and, in mild cases, the distinction can be unclear or the second stage may never occur. The diagnostic usefulness of a history of a biphasic illness has been overemphasized. HIV co-infection does not seem to affect the clinical presentation of leptospirosis in the few co-infected patients described thus far.

# **Anicteric Leptospirosis**

#### Symptoms and Signs

Typically, the disease begins with the abrupt onset of intense headache, fever, chills, and myalgia. Fever often exceeds 40°C (103°F) and is preceded by rigors. Muscle pain can be excruciating and occurs most commonly in the thighs, calves, lumbosacral region, and abdomen. Abdominal wall pain accompanied by palpation tenderness can mimic an acute surgical abdomen. Nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, and sore throat are other frequent symptoms. Cough and chest pain figure prominently in reports of patients from Korea and China.

Conjunctival suffusion is a helpful diagnostic clue that usually appears 2 or 3 days after the onset of fever and involves the bulbar conjunctiva. Pus and serous secretions are absent, and there is no matting of the eyelashes and eyelids. Mild suffusion can easily be overlooked. Less common and less distinctive signs include pharyngeal injection, splenomegaly, hepatomegaly, lymphadenopathy, and skin lesions. Within a week, most patients become asymptomatic. After several days of apparent recovery, the illness resumes in some individuals. Manifestations of the second stage are more variable and mild than those of the initial illness and usually last 2 to 4 days. Leptospires disappear from the blood, cerebrospinal fluid (CSF), and tissues but appear in the urine. Serum antibody titers rise—hence the term immune phase. Aseptic meningitis is the hallmark of this stage of leptospirosis but is not associated with mortality. Pleocytosis of the CSF can be demonstrated in 80% to 90% of all patients during the second week of illness, although only about 50% will have clinical signs and symptoms of meningitis. Meningeal signs can last several weeks but usually resolve within a day or two. Uveitis is a late manifestation of leptospirosis, generally seen 4 to 8 months after the illness has begun. The anterior uveal tract is most frequently affected, and pain, photophobia, and blurring of vision are the usual symptoms.

#### Laboratory Findings

White blood cell count varies, but neutrophilia is usually present. Urinalysis may show proteinuria, pyuria, and microscopic hematuria. Enzyme markers of skeletal muscle damage, such as creatinine kinase and aldolase, are elevated in the sera of 50% of patients during the first week of illness. Chest radiographs from patients with pulmonary manifestations show a variety of abnormalities, but none is pathognomonic of leptospirosis. The most common finding is patchy, non-lobal, diffuse infiltrates.

#### **Icteric Leptospirosis (Weil's Disease)**

Weil's disease refers to severe, life-threatening leptospirosis and is characterized by jaundice, renal dysfunction, hemorrhagic manifestations, refractory shock, and a high mortality rate. Although jaundice is the hallmark of severe leptospirosis, true liver failure does not occur. The degree of jaundice has no prognostic significance, but its presence or absence does—virtually all leptospirosis deaths occur in icteric patients but are usually related to other associated mechanisms (hemorrhage or oliguric renal failure). Icterus first appears between the fifth and ninth days of illness, reaches maximum intensity 4 or 5 days later, and continues for an average of 1 month. Hepatomegaly is found in the majority of patients; hepatic percussion tenderness is a reliable clinical marker of continuing disease activity. There is no residual liver dysfunction in survivors of Weil's disease, consistent with the absence of structural damage.

Bleeding is occasionally seen in anicteric cases but is most prevalent in severe disease. Purpura, petechiae, epistaxis, bleeding of the gums, and minor hemoptysis are the most common hemorrhagic manifestations; however, deaths occur from subarachnoid hemorrhage and exsanguination from gastrointestinal bleeding. Conjunctival hemorrhage is an extremely useful diagnostic finding and, when combined with scleral icterus and conjunctival suffusion, produces eye findings strongly suggestive of leptospirosis [\(Fig.](#page-2-0) [79.1](#page-2-0)). The frequency with which severe pulmonary hemorrhage complicates leptospirosis is variable but is a cardinal feature of some outbreaks.

Life-threatening oliguric renal failure is a complication of icteric disease, although all forms of leptospirosis may be associated with non-oliguric kidney dysfunction. Oliguria or anuria usually develop during the second week of illness but may appear earlier. Complete anuria is a grave prognostic sign often seen in patients who present late in the course of illness with frank uremia and irreversible

<span id="page-2-0"></span>disease. Because renal failure develops very quickly in leptospirosis, symptoms and signs of uremia are frequently encountered. Anorexia, vomiting, drowsiness, disorientation, and confusion are seen early and rapidly progress to convulsions, stupor, and coma in severe cases. Disturbances of consciousness in a patient with severe leptospirosis are usually caused by uremic encephalopathy, whereas in anicteric cases aseptic encephalitis is the usual cause. Renal function eventually returns to normal in survivors of Weil's disease, although detectable abnormalities may persist for several months.

Leptospirosis-associated SPHS is now recognized as a widespread public health problem with a case fatality rate of about 50%. This lethal complication of leptospirosis can occur either with or without jaundice and renal failure. Hemoptysis is the cardinal sign but may not be apparent until patients are intubated. Real-time polymerase chain reaction (PCR) has shown that leptospiremia is 10,000 or more bacteria per milliliter of blood in SPHS—the apparent critical threshold for severe outcomes such as SPHS and death[.6](#page-4-10)

#### Laboratory Features of Weil's Disease

Hyperbilirubinemia results from increases in both conjugated (direct) and unconjugated (indirect) bilirubin, but elevations of the direct fraction predominate. Prolongations of the prothrombin time commonly occur but are easily corrected by the administration of vitamin K; modest elevations of serum alkaline phosphatase are typical. There is mild hepatocellular necrosis; greater than fivefold increases of transaminase (aminotransferase) levels are unusual. Jaundiced patients usually have leukocytosis in the range of 15,000 to 30,000 per mm3 , and neutrophilia is constant. Anemia is common and multifactorial; blood loss and renal dysfunction contribute frequently, intravascular hemolysis less often. Mild thrombocytopenia often occurs, but decreases in platelet count sufficient to be associated with bleeding are exceptional. The specific gravity of the urine is high. Hypokalemia due to renal potassium wasting can occur, and hypomagnesemia has been reported.

#### **PATIENT EVALUATION, DIAGNOSIS, AND DIFFERENTIAL DIAGNOSIS**

# **Patient Evaluation**

Patients who present with an undifferentiated febrile illness must be carefully evaluated for possible leptospirosis. A history of submersive water exposure or direct animal contact is essential to suspecting diagnosis. Key symptoms and signs are conjunctival suffusion and severe myalgia with tenderness. In the context of a known outbreak of leptospirosis, individuals must be carefully assessed for signs of severe disease. The most important signs of severity are jaundice, severe thrombocytopenia, bleeding, pulmonary involvement, oliguria, hypomagnesemia and hypokalemia, and elevated serum creatinine.

#### **Diagnosis**

Most cases go undiagnosed because symptoms and signs are often non-specific and diagnostic confirmation is rarely available where most disease transmission occurs. Failure to diagnose leptospirosis is particularly unfortunate: severely ill patients often recover completely with prompt treatment, but delayed therapy is likely to result in a poor clinical outcome. Late disease can often be recognized by its typical clinical manifestations, but the presentation of early leptospirosis is usually non-specific and is therefore difficult to identify clinically. Leptospirosis has long been acknowledged to be a frequent cause of undifferentiated febrile illness in developing countries. Co-infection with diseases such as dengue, malaria, and scrub typhus has been reported and adds to the diagnostic confusion of tropical fevers.

Laboratory diagnosis of leptospirosis remains problematic. The microscopic agglutination test is considered the serodiagnostic method of choice for leptospirosis, but its complexity limits its use to reference laboratories and requires paired acute and convalescent serum samples. Dilutions of patient sera are applied to a panel of live, pathogenic leptospires. The results are viewed under dark-field microscopy and expressed qualitatively as the proportion of organisms cleared from the field by agglutination. Inadequate quality controls of the live reference strain panels can lead to frequent false-negative results.[7](#page-4-4) A new generation of commercially available, rapid serodiagnostic kits that rely on whole *Leptospira* antigen preparations have been developed. Unfortunately, these assays seem to have unacceptably low sensitivities during acute-phase illness, and persistent antibody produces low specificity in regions of high endemic transmission. The need for practical, affordable diagnostic kits to be available in areas where leptospirosis is common cannot be overemphasized. PCR and urine antigen detection are research tools that would be of the greatest potential diagnostic value in patients who present early, before antibodies have reached detectable levels; these tests are not available for most affected populations.

Isolation of leptospires from blood or CSF is possible during the first 10 days of clinical illness, but specialized media are necessary. Serially diluted urine provides the highest yield. Unfortunately, culture results are only known many weeks later—too late to benefit severely ill, hospitalized patients.

Several attempts have been made to formulate diagnostic algorithms by assigning points to various clinical, epidemiologic, and laboratory parameters. The points are totaled and the score is then used to represent the likelihood that the patient in question has leptospirosis. An example is shown in [Table 79.2.](#page-3-0) The usefulness of these scoring systems is limited by their complexity, by marked regional variability in the quality of available diagnostic tests, and by regional differences in the prevalent differential diagnoses that must be considered. However, these scoring systems are useful teaching tools and emphasize the important epidemiologic and clinical characteristics of leptospirosis.

#### **Differential Diagnosis**

The typical leptospirosis patient has a history of water or animal contact, conjunctival suffusion, and severe myalgia. It is important to solicit these findings in both mild and severe cases of leptospirosis. Atypical or mild cases are often confused with other entities, but because of a low index of suspicion and the disease's protean manifestations, the diagnosis is often missed, even in typical cases.

#### <span id="page-3-1"></span>**BOX 79.1** Clinical Pearl

Muscles of patients with leptospirosis can be exquisitely tender and painful to the touch, but palpation of painful muscles in patients with scrub typhus sometimes provides pain relief.

The most important differential diagnoses differ in mild and severe disease.

#### Anicteric Leptospirosis

Acute undifferentiated febrile illness, fever of unknown origin, and aseptic meningitis are the most common clinical impressions in mild leptospirosis. Severe myalgia involving several different muscle groups, particularly the calves—not just the abdominal wall—suggests leptospirosis rather than appendicitis. Fever and vomiting are frequently misdiagnosed as gastroenteritis.

## Weil's Disease

Viral hepatitis is a common misdiagnosis in patients with Weil's disease. Leukocytosis, elevated serum bilirubin levels *without* marked transaminase elevations, and renal dysfunction are typical of leptospirosis but unusual in hepatitis. Marked leukocytosis and a negative blood film argue against malaria. Jaundice, severe renal dysfunction, and leukocytosis are atypical of typhoid fever. Differentiating leptospirosis from scrub typhus and Korean hemorrhagic fever (caused by Hantaan virus) in areas where these diseases co-exist is more difficult. Both are associated with animals, and both can cause conjunctival suffusion. Korean hemorrhagic fever is transmitted by infected rodent urine, and mixed infection with *Leptospira interrogans* and Hantaan virus has been reported. Liver disease is not usually a prominent manifestation of Korean hemorrhagic fever. Splenomegaly and generalized lymphadenopathy are characteristic of scrub typhus but not leptospirosis. Serum creatinine levels are usually normal, even in jaundiced patients with *Orientia tsutsugamushi* infection. The myalgia of leptospirosis is usually more severe than that of scrub typhus [\(Box 79.1](#page-3-1)).

#### <span id="page-3-2"></span>**BOX 79.2** Clinical Pearl

Kawasaki's disease (mucocutaneous lymph node syndrome) must be differentiated from leptospirosis in children <5 years old with desquamation and involvement of the gallbladder and myocardium.

### Severe Pulmonary Hemorrhage Syndrome

Leptospirosis with prominent hemorrhagic manifestations is easily misdiagnosed as dengue virus infection. A severe outbreak of leptospirosis with SPHS in Nicaragua was initially thought to be dengue[.12](#page-4-8)

#### Childhood Leptospirosis

This shares many features with adult disease; pulmonary hemorrhage occurs, and severe renal dysfunction is common. Distinct clinical features include hypotension, acalculous cholecystitis, pancreatitis, and abdominal causalgia (burning pain). Skin lesions may desquamate and become gangrenous ([Box 79.2](#page-3-2)).

#### **TREATMENT**

Placebo-controlled, double-blind trials have demonstrated that doxycycline benefits patients with early, mild leptospirosis and that intravenous penicillin helps adults with severe, late disease[.14](#page-4-11) The outcome of severe, pediatric leptospirosis is also improved by penicillin therapy.[15](#page-4-12) Antibiotics should therefore be given to all patients with leptospirosis, regardless of age or when in their disease course they are seen. Doxycycline is given at doses of 100 mg orally twice a day for 1 week. Patients who are vomiting or are seriously ill require parenteral therapy. Intravenous penicillin G is administered to adults as 1.5 million units every 6 hours for 1 week. Recent trials from Thailand indicate that treatment with ceftriaxone, cefotaxime, and doxycycline had equivalent efficacy to penicillin in patients with mild to moderately severe disease. However, it is not known whether these antibiotics are as effective as high-dose penicillin for treatment of the most severely ill individuals. Doxycycline and azithromycin had comparable efficacy as presumptive treatment of mildly ill patients found later to have leptospirosis, scrub typhus, or dual infections.

There is controversy regarding the occurrence of a Jarisch– Herxheimer reaction in leptospirosis. If present, it is much less prominent in leptospirosis than in other spirochetal illnesses. The important practical consideration is that antibiotics should not be withheld because of the fear of a possible Jarisch–Herxheimer reaction.

The management of pulmonary hemorrhage often requires prompt intubation and mechanical ventilation. SPHS patients have physiologic and pathologic evidence of acute respiratory distress syndrome, so ventilation using low tidal volumes and high postexpiratory end pressures should be provided; hemodialysis even in the absence of renal failure may be useful for the pulmonary hemorrhage syndrome.[14](#page-4-11) Respiratory support to maintain adequate tissue oxygenation is essential because in non-fatal cases complete recovery of pulmonary function can be achieved. Ensuring adequate renal perfusion prevents renal failure in the vast majority of oliguric individuals. Continuous hemofiltration has been shown to be more effective than peritoneal dialysis in treating infection-associated hypercatabolic renal failure. Peritoneal dialysis, however, may be the only option in resource-limited settings. Whichever method of dialysis is chosen, it must be started promptly—delays increase mortality.

#### **PREVENTION**

Doxycycline 200 mg taken once a week prevents infection by pathogenic leptospires[.16](#page-4-13) Widespread use of doxycycline prophylaxis is not indicated, but it can benefit those who are at high risk for a short time, such as military personnel and certain agricultural workers. Infection by leptospires confers only serovar-specific immunity; second attacks caused by different serovars can occur. The efficacy and safety of human leptospiral vaccines have yet to be conclusively demonstrated. Prevention of leptospirosis in the tropics is particularly difficult. The large animal reservoir of infection is impossible to eliminate, the occurrence of numerous serovars limits the usefulness of serovar-specific vaccine, and the wearing of protective clothing (e.g., rubber boots in rice fields) is both prohibitively expensive and impractical. Providing proper sanitation in urban slum communities would be the most effective control measure in this setting.

# **<sup>80</sup> 80** Relapsing Fever and Borrelioses

*Michel Drancourt*

#### KEY FEATURES

- • Relapsing fevers (RFs) are ectoparasite-borne, tropical diseases caused by a group of related species of *Borrelia,* different from the *Borrelia* species responsible for Lyme disease.
- • RF is a common and often unappreciated cause of fever in many areas of Africa and Asia.
- • RF can be louse borne (LBRF) or tick borne (TBRF).
- • LBRF is a human-restricted infection caused by *B. recurrentis* associated with human body lice.
- • TBRF is associated with a number of borreliae, including *B. duttoni,* transmitted by soft ticks often associated with animal reservoirs.
- • RFs are characterized by recurrent/relapsing episodes of fever and spirochetemia.
- • RF can be severe. Mortality can exceed 30% in untreated cases of LBRF.
- • Rapid diagnosis usually relies on microscopic observation of borreliae on thick blood smear, but PCR-based diagnosis tests are also available.
- • Treatment usually involves administration of doxycycline or penicillins.
- • The Jarisch–Herxheimer reaction is frequent within the first 2 hours of treatment.
- • Prevention involves de-lousing and minimizing exposure to soft ticks; no vaccine is available.

#### **INTRODUCTION**

Relapsing fevers (RFs) are a group of bacterial diseases characterized by recurrent episodes of fever and spirochetemia. The true global burden of RF is uncertain, but a number of studies suggest that RF is a very common cause of fever in areas of Africa, especially among populations where louse infestation is common or where humans are exposed to competent tick vectors. The term was first used to describe an illness that broke out in Edinburgh from 1843 to 1846. A causative *Borellia* agent was first observed in the blood of German patients by Otto Obermeier in the Berlin Charité Hospital in 1873[.1](#page-9-0) Tholozan then described RF in Eurasia in 1882[.2](#page-9-1) Tick transmission was demonstrated in 1905 in Western Africa by Dutton and Tod[d3](#page-9-2) after tick-borne relapsing fever (TBRF) plagued the David Livingstone expedition in Africa[.4](#page-9-3) American cases were first documented in 1915 in Colorado.[5](#page-9-4)

RF remains a major cause of morbidity and mortality in large areas of Africa and Asia[.4,6](#page-9-3)

# **EPIDEMIOLOGY**

# **Reservoirs and Transmission of Relapsing Fever Borreliae** [\(Fig. 80.1](#page-6-0))

*Borrelia recurrentis* is unique among RF borreliae, being a humanrestricted pathogen transmitted by the body louse *Pediculus humanus;* crushing the infected louse introduces *B. recurrentis* organisms into scratched skin; prolonged excretion of *B. recurrentis* in lice feces may enhance transmission[.4,7](#page-9-3) Other RF borreliae are responsible for tick-borne relapsing fever (TBRF) transmitted from various reservoirs without any apparent adverse effects upon their vectors[.4](#page-9-3) TBRF borreliae are transmitted by soft ticks belonging to the genus *Ornithodoros,* family Argasidae. They have nocturnal feeding habits involving painless bites. TBRF borreliae invade all tick organs, including salivary glands and excretory organs; infectious saliva and coxal fluid may contaminate the feeding site[.3](#page-9-2) *B. duttonii* was believed to predominately affect humans, but it may have other significant reservoirs, as suggested by the detection of *B. duttonii* DNA in chickens and pigs.[4](#page-9-3) Other TBRF *Borrelia* species primarily infect rodents and insectivorous animals and are largely zoonotic[.8](#page-9-5) Bats have been implicated as reservoirs for *B. persica* in Central Asia,[2](#page-9-1) and a new, unnamed TBRF species related to *B. recurrentis* was recently identified in a bat in the UK[.9](#page-9-6) The new TBRF, *B. johnsonii,* was found in a *Carios* bat tick in the United States[.10](#page-9-7) Competence of birds as a reservoir has not been determined, but the same *B. hermsii* genotype has been documented in an owl and a pine squirrel in Montana,[11](#page-9-8) and seabirds infested with *Carios* ticks in Japan were found to be infected by a new TBRF.[12](#page-9-9) TBRF borreliae can survive in ticks for up to 7 years after feeding, and some ticks demonstrate trans-ovarial transmission.[2,4](#page-9-1) *B. miyamotoi* is transmitted by hard ticks (*Ixodes*) and has been reported as a cause of fever in areas of North America.

#### **Geographic Distribution** ([Fig. 80.2\)](#page-7-0)

Each RF *Borrelia* species is considered to be vector specific.[3](#page-9-2) In Europe, a few cases have been related to an unnamed TBRF *Borrelia* most closely related to *B. hispanica* in Spain.[13](#page-9-10) In Africa, *Ornithodoros erraticus* transmits *B. hispanica* in coastal areas of Morocco, Algeria, and Tunisia; *O. sonrai* (formerly *Alectorobius sonrai*) transmits *B. crocidurae* in West Africa and several arid areas of northern Africa; *O. moubata*/*O. porcinus* transmit *B. duttonii* in central, eastern, and southern Africa, whereas *B. recurrentis* persists only in Ethiopia[.3,4,14](#page-9-2) In Tanzania, molecular studies have identified a non-cultured *Borrelia* species most closely related to North America TBRF borreliae; its role in human infection is unknown[.4](#page-9-3) In Central Asia, *B. persica* is transmitted by *O. tholozani*. [15,16](#page-9-11) In North America, *B. hermsii* is the main cause of TBRF in western areas, extending from southern British Columbia down to Los Angeles County[17;](#page-9-12) *B. turicatae* is transmitted by *O. turicata* in Texas, and *B. lonestari* has been isolated only from *Amblyomma americanum* ticks in the southeastern and south-central United States, where it is a putative agent of the "Southern tick-associated rash illness".[18,19](#page-9-13) Among TBRF borreliae of unknown pathogenicity in humans, *B. anserina* is recognized as the agent of fowl spirochetosis,[20](#page-9-14) and *B. coriaceae* is a putative agent of epizootic bovine abortion.[21](#page-9-15)

The rate of TBRF transmission after the feeding of an infectious tick has been estimated to be 50%, with an incubation period of 2 to 18 days[,16](#page-9-16) but the epidemiology of RF borrelioses is poorly understood, as most data are specific to louse-borne RF (LBRF), and TBRF estimates have been made on the basis of sporadic localized studies[.4](#page-9-3) Moreover, routine microscopic examination of blood does not allow distinguishing between the various *Borrelia* species.[4](#page-9-3) Interestingly, TBRF was found to be the most common bacterial infection in Senegal[,22](#page-9-17) to be responsible for 27% of hospital

admissions in Ethiopia,[4](#page-9-3) and was diagnosed in 21% of patients with unexplained fever in Morocco[.23](#page-9-18) In the Democratic Republic of Congo, TBRF was found in 4.3% to 7.4% of outpatients.[14](#page-9-19) In Tanzania, it is responsible for perinatal mortality, with rates of 463/1000 in endemic regions[.4](#page-9-3)

Seasonality of human RF seems to be driven by human activities; in Ethiopian rural settings, a recent study indicated that LBRF was more frequent in the dry season, possibly associated with the seasonal migration of highlanders[.4](#page-9-3) In North America, cases are more frequent during spring and summer, in line with vacation periods[,5](#page-9-4) and are associated with activities that expose individuals to infectious ticks, including overnight stays in mountain recreational cabins, caves, and crawl spaces under buildings.[17,24,25](#page-9-12)

# **NATURAL HISTORY, PATHOGENESIS, AND PATHOLOGY**

#### **Relapsing Fever Borreliae**

The genus *Borrelia,* phylum Spirochetae, includes a number of borreliae, including Lyme disease borreliae, about 20 species of RF borreliae, and reptile-associated borreliae without current medical interes[t26](#page-9-20) ([Fig. 80.3\)](#page-7-1). RF borreliae feature a spiroid morphology and contain a 1.2- to 1.5-Mb, linear, and fragmented genome composed of one chromosome and 7 to 16 plasmids[.27](#page-9-21) Genomic analyses indicate that RF borreliae have several silent variable-membrane protein gene copies kept in a plasmidic library, with only one of these being expressed on the chromosome at any given time. Analyses indicate that *B. recurrentis* is a louse-borne derivative of *B. duttonii* undergoing genomic decay[.27](#page-9-21)

#### **Pathogenesis**

After inoculation into blood, RF organisms are cleared by an IgM-mediated, complement-independent mechanism targeting the expressed variable membrane protein, as well as antibodyindependent splenic phagocytosis.[28](#page-9-22) The organism undergoes antigen variation, with the expression of a new variable membrane protein resulting in evasion of the immune system, the expansion of a new *Borrelia* clone, and an illness characterized as a RF. *B. duttonii* and *B. crocidurae* (but not *B. recurrentis*) bind to erythrocyte neolactoglycans (leading to erythrocyte rosetting), providing

borreliae with essential purine metabolites and contributing to immune system evasion, hemorrhages, reduced tissue blood perfusion, and tissue invasiveness.[4,29](#page-9-3) Bacteremia results in multi-systemic infection of the skin, joints, heart, and the central nervous system, but RF borreliae have never been observed intracellularly. Systemic dissemination results in complications and even death. Congenital TBRF may result from trans-placental transmission or may possibly be caused by infection while traversing the birth canal.[30](#page-9-23) The brain can remain infected weeks after blood clearance, and borreliae entrapped in the brain can re-seed blood in the case of immunosuppression.[31](#page-9-24) A Jarisch–Herxheimer reaction is often observed in patients within hours of initiation of treatment with penicillin or tetracyclines and is linked to the lysis of intra-vascular borreliae with subsequent activation of cytokine cascades and a transient elevation of plasma tumor necrosis factor, interleukin (IL)-6, and IL-8.[32](#page-9-25)

#### **Clinical Features**

RFs are to be diagnosed in local populations, as well as in travelers and refugees from endemic regions.[33](#page-9-26) LBRF is characterized by high fevers that can relapse up to four times (five fever episodes in total); *B. crocidurae* and *B. hispanica* infection have been associated with up to 13 recurrences of fever observed over several months[.4](#page-9-3) Fever is accompanied by a flulike syndrome with rigors, headache, myalgia, and arthralgias in >90% patients.[4](#page-9-3) North American TBRF is associated with nausea and vomiting.[17](#page-9-12) Evidence of a tick bite can be found in only 25% of patients, although clinical examination may reveal a transient, erythematous macular lesion at the site of the tick bite[,17](#page-9-12) tachycardia occurs in >95% of patients, conjunctivitis in >90% of *B. recurrentis*–infected patients, and hepatosplenomegaly in >65% patients.[4](#page-9-3) Although TBRF patients may have thrombocytopenia, bleeding complications have been specifically observed in almost a third of LBRF patients and may include epistaxis, purpura, hemoptysis, hematemesis, bloody diarrhea, hematuria, sub-arachnoidal and cerebral hemorrhages, and retinal hemorrhage.[4,5](#page-9-3) In North American TBRF, dysuria occurs in over 10% of patients, microhematuria in 30%, and proteinuria in 46%[.5](#page-9-4)

Neurologic manifestations are observed in 10% to 80% patients with *B. duttonii, B. turicatae,* and *B. recurrentis* infection, and in <5% patients with *B. persica, B. hermsii, B. hispanica,* and *B. recurrentis* infection[.24](#page-9-27) Neurologic involvement may include meningismus and normal or slightly abnormal cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) in the case of TBRF, but not in the case of LBRF.[24](#page-9-27) TBRF borreliae have been isolated from the CSF in African patients. Cranial neuritis and febrile facial palsy have been observed during the second or subsequent relapses with *B. duttonii* and *B. turicatae,* but not in LBRF. Encephalitis may manifest as extreme somnolence, seizures, or hemiplegia for a few weeks. Less common manifestations include myelitis, radiculitis, and neuropsychiatric disturbances.

Ocular complications observed after the third relapse of *B. duttonii, B. hermsii, B. turicatae,* and *B. hispanica* infection (but not LBRF) include iritis, cyclitis, choroiditis, and optic neuritis. Ocular involvement impairs vision[.24,34](#page-9-27) Myocarditis and liver dysfunction are rare. Infection with *B. crocidurae* and *B. hispanica* are associated with a low mortality (<0.2%),[22](#page-9-17) but mortality can exceed 30% during untreated LBRF *B. recurrentis* infection[.4](#page-9-3) Even with appropriate treatment, mortality can reach 2% to 6% in LBRF[.4](#page-9-3)

RF during pregnancy can be severe. *B. crocidurae* provoked one early delivery among 16 women in Senegal[,22](#page-9-17) and in one study in the Democratic Republic of Congo, *B. duttonii* was diagnosed in 6.4% of hospitalized pregnant women and was associated with maternal death and spontaneous abortion[.14](#page-9-19) In Africa, mortality of TBRF is higher among pregnant women than in the general population.[35](#page-9-28) In North America, infection of four pregnant women by *B. hermsii* resulted in congenital TBRF in one case.[5](#page-9-4)

## **PATIENT EVALUATION, DIAGNOSIS, AND DIFFERENTIAL DIAGNOSIS**

The diagnosis of RF should be considered in any patient presenting with a febrile flulike syndrome returning from, or living in, a country endemic for RF. In Africa, the diagnosis must be considered in a patient presenting with "*Plasmodium*-negative malaria" or "treatment-resistant malaria"[36;](#page-9-29) moreover, malaria co-infection has been reported[.4](#page-9-3) A history of tick bite and a history of RF increase the predictive value of the diagnosis, but bites of soft ticks are usually unnoticed by patients.

Diagnosis usually involves microscopic examination of a blood smear after Giemsa, Wright, or Gram staining, or using dark-field microscopy. Thick blood smears should be performed (thin smears are only 20% as sensitive as thick blood smears).[22,23](#page-9-17) Spirochetemia is usually <200 borreliae/µL in most of *B. crocidurae* and *B. hispanica* cases. It is 10 times higher in *B. duttonii* patients and even higher in *B. recurrentis* cases[.4](#page-9-3) Quantitative buffy coat analysis is effective in the detection of blood *B. crocidurae,* but requires a fluorescence microscope.[37](#page-9-30)

Molecular detection can be performed using whole blood, using 16S rDNA-derived primers,[23](#page-9-18) the non-coding intergenic 16S-23S rDNA spacer,[23](#page-9-18) or the flagellin-encoding gene *fla,*[2](#page-9-1) which are common to Lyme disease and TBRF borreliae, whereas the *glp*Q gene is specific for TBRF borreliae[.38](#page-9-31) Semi-nested and nested polymerase chain reaction (PCR) both carry a high risk of contamination and should be avoided. Nested PCR-based detection must be interpreted with caution.

Isolation and culture of borreliae is very sensitive and involves inoculating decontaminated ticks or human blood or CSF into Barbour–Stonner–Kelly-H mediu[m39](#page-9-32) complemented by 12% rabbit serum, or into modified Kelly's mediu[m38](#page-9-31) or tick cell line[.18](#page-9-13) Inoculation with 200 µL patients' whole blood, the platelet-rich fraction of plasma, or the buffy coat is the most sensitive method[.37](#page-9-30) Antibiotic susceptibility testing is not a routine test. Animal models indicate that TBRF could be treated with tetracyclines, penicillin, cephalosporins (including ceftriaxone), and aminoglycosides; the latter results disagree with in vitro data[.24](#page-9-27) Animal studies indicate that chloramphenicol is not effective[.24](#page-9-27)

Serologic assays are complicated by the fact that RF borreliae extensively alter their surface proteins and by the fact that >10 proteins cross-react with Lyme disease borreliae.[5](#page-9-4) As RF borreliae are not widely available, a standardized enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay for *B. burgdorferi* could be used as a firstline serologic test, with Western blot allowing discrimination between cross-reacting RF borreliae, Lyme disease borreliae, and syphilis. A GlpQ assay specific for RF borreliae has also been used[.40](#page-9-33)

#### **TREATMENT**

Rapid administration of an effective antibiotic is mandatory in suspected cases of RF. Patients are most commonly treated with doxycycline (200 mg per day; 1–2 mg/kg/day in children aged >8 years); short-course treatment could be used for LBRF, whereas a 7- to 21-day treatment is recommended for TBRF to prevent relapses[.6,23](#page-9-34) In children <8 years and in pregnant women, 1.5 g/ day amoxicillin for 7 to 21 days could be used. Patients with neurologic involvement may be treated with 2 g ceftriaxone/day for 14 days. A Jarisch–Herxheimer reaction, with sudden fever, rigors, and hemodynamic instability, has been observed with β-lactams, tetracyclines, erythromycin, and ciprofloxaci[n41;](#page-9-35) it was reported in almost all patients with LBRF, in up to 59% in *B. duttonii* patients, and in up to 54% in *B. hermsii* patients, but not in *B. crocidurae* patients.[5,32](#page-9-4) Patients should be observed for at least 2 hours after initiation of antibiotic treatment.[5](#page-9-4)

Supportive therapy should be undertaken, including for patients developing the Jarisch–Herxheimer reaction.

#### **PREVENTION AND CONTROL**

Primary prevention of TBRF relies on public education regarding the risk of minimizing rodent exposure, rodent nest manipulation, and visiting caves and similar sites.[25](#page-9-36) Advice should be given on minimizing exposed skin and pre-treating bed nets and clothes with an insecticide such as permethrin or dimethyltoluamide to prevent the attachment of all stages of *Argasidae* ticks to humans. Pre-exposure prophylaxis with amoxicillin has been successfully used[.2](#page-9-1) Primary prevention of LBRF relies on clothing hygiene aimed at avoiding body louse infestation.[4](#page-9-3) There is no vaccine against RF.

In the case of potential exposure to ticks in high-risk environments, secondary prevention by pre-emptive administration of oral doxycycline (200 mg on day 1 and then 100 mg per day for 4 days) has been demonstrated to be effective and safe[.16](#page-9-16) Doxycycline prophylaxis has, however, been associated with photo-allergic rash, photo-onycholysis, nausea, diarrhea, and vaginal itch[.42](#page-9-37) People should be informed of these potential side effects and advised to minimize sun exposure.
