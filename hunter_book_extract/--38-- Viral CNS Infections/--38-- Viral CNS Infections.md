## **38.1** Rabies and Related Viruses

*Mary J. Warrell, David A. Warrell*

#### KEY FEATURES

- • The genus *Lyssavirus* of the Rhabdoviridae includes classic rabies virus and other rabies-related viruses, causing at least 59,000 human deaths annually, mainly in Asia and Africa.
- • The greatest threat of rabies to man is the persistent cycle of infection in stray dogs, but several other terrestrial mammal species are reservoirs, and there is evidence of widespread infection in bats. In the Americas, bat viruses are classic species/genotype 1 rabies. Elsewhere, all bat lyssaviruses are other species/ genotypes (rabies-related viruses).
- • Rabies virus can penetrate broken skin and intact mucosae. Humans are usually infected when virus-laden saliva is inoculated through the skin by the bite of a rabid mammal.
- • After a variable, often prolonged, incubation period, signs of furious or paralytic rabies portend a rapidly fatal course. The mechanism of neuronal dysfunction is unknown.
- • In developing countries, diagnosis relies on recognition of hydrophobic spasms or other clinical features. Paralytic disease is less easily identified and is misdiagnosed globally. The diagnosis can be made during life, but lack of facilities often hampers confirmation of disease.
- • One vaccinated and one unvaccinated patient bitten by bats in North America have recovered from rabies encephalomyelitis after intensive care. Clinically, the American insectivorous bat strains of rabies genotype/ species 1 viruses seem to be less pathogenic; dog rabies virus infection remains universally fatal in unvaccinated people. No treatment has proved effective experimentally, and intensive care therapy is rarely indicated. Palliation is usually the most appropriate management.
- • Ninety-nine percent of human deaths could be prevented by controlling the transmission of dog rabies, but education and resources are lacking. Combined pre-exposure vaccination with post-exposure boosting has proved 100% effective in humans. Pre-exposure immunization should be encouraged, but the cost may be prohibitive. Intradermal vaccine regimens could increase the affordability of treatment without loss of effectiveness.
- • Control of rabies in animal reservoirs through mass vaccination campaigns has led to fewer cases of human rabies in some settings.

### **INTRODUCTION**

Rabies is a zoonosis of wild and domestic mammals that may be transmitted to humans, usually by the bite of a rabid dog. Rabies viruses are bullet-shaped, single-stranded, negative-sense RNA viruses.

Encephalomyelitis caused by dog rabies virus has proved invariably fatal in unvaccinated humans. The disease is enzootic in certain carnivore and bat species throughout most parts of the world. The highest human rabies mortality is in developing countries where rabies is uncontrolled in domestic dogs. Classic rabies virus and 15 rabies-related lyssaviruses in three phylogroups comprise the genus *Lyssavirus* of the Rhabdoviridae family.[1](#page--1-0) Seven species are single bat isolates. The reservoir species of all rabiesrelated lyssaviruses are Old World bats except one, Mokola virus, which is found in shrews. Six rabies-related lyssaviruses are known to infect man [\(Table 38.1.1](#page-1-0)). All bat rabies viruses in the Americas are classic rabies genotype/species 1.

#### **EPIDEMIOLOGY**

Rabies is enzootic worldwide with the exception of Antarctica and a number of islands, including Iceland, Ireland, New Guinea, New Zealand, Japan, Singapore, and some Mediterranean and Caribbean islands. Western Europe and Australia are free of rabies in terrestrial mammals, but bats may harbor rabies-related lyssaviruses. Human rabies is generally under-reported. A conservative estimate of annual mortality in Asia and Africa is 59,000. Countries with a high incidence of human rabies include India, Pakistan, and Bangladesh. In the United States, 21 cases were recognized in the last 10 years, 43% of which were infected abroad. Seventy-five percent of indigenous infections were due to bat rabies viruses.

The major reservoir and vector of rabies is the domestic dog, causing >99% of human infections. Sylvatic rabies occurs predominantly in skunks, raccoons, foxes, and insectivorous bats in North America; foxes in the Arctic; mongooses in some Caribbean islands; vampire bats in Latin America and Trinidad; jackals, wolves, and small carnivores in Africa and Asia; and foxes, wolves, and raccoon dogs in Europe. Transmission occurs to vectors, for example, cats, which may infect humans, but there is no cycle of infection within vector species. Vampire bats (*Desmodontinae*) are confined to southern Texas, Mexico, Central and South America, and some Caribbean islands (see Chapter 140). Rabid bats feed on, and infect, cattle, resulting in financial loss. Outbreaks of vampire bat rabies in humans occur in jungle areas of the Amazonian region, possibly as a result of disturbances of bat ecology. The reservoirs and distribution of rabies-related viruses are listed in [Table 38.1.1](#page-1-0)*.*

In dogs, the incubation period is usually between 2 weeks and 4 months. The symptoms include a change in behavior, fever, and intense irritation at the site of the bite. Dogs can become aggressive but more often show features of paralytic or "dumb" rabies with paralysis of neck and hind legs and vocal chords, dysphagia, and drooling of saliva. Virus may be excreted in the saliva for 2 or 3

days before there are signs of rabies, and the animal usually dies within the next 7 days. Hydrophobia is not seen in animals, but the inability to drink is a common symptom of rabies.

Human rabies usually results from inoculation of virus-bearing saliva through the skin by the bite of a rabid dog. Scratches, abrasions, and other wounds (also intact mucosal membranes) can be contaminated with infected saliva. Rare modes of infection are transplantation of infected grafts of cornea, kidney, liver, lung, pancreas, and even a segment of artery from donors who had died of unsuspected rabies; inapparent contact with bats in caves; inhalation of virus aerosols as a result of laboratory accidents; and butchering infected meat. Despite a single report of congenital or neonatal infection, many infants of infected mothers have remained healthy. Although transmission of infection to intimate family members has been suspected on a few occasions, it has never been virologically proved. This also applies to hospital staff.[2](#page--1-2)

#### **NATURAL HISTORY, PATHOGENESIS, AND PATHOLOGY**

After inoculation, rabies virus may replicate locally in myocytes before binding to acetylcholine receptors at the post-synaptic membrane of neuro-muscular junctions. The virus is then poised to enter peripheral motor neurons by attachment to one of two or more receptor molecules and then endocytosis. Other means of infection of peripheral neurons probably occur, for example, after a superficial bat bite. It is conveyed by the retrograde axonal transport mechanism[3](#page--1-3) toward the cell soma, where it replicates and is transmitted via the dendrite to adjacent neurons, eventually reaching the central nervous system (CNS) via transsynaptic spread. The virus remains intraneuronal, and there is massive replication in the brain[.4](#page--1-4) Centrifugal spread of virus from the CNS along nerves infects the salivary glands (where it is shed and, in infected animals, spread by the bite), lacrimal glands, skin (where it may be detected in nerve twiglets in hair follicles), respiratory tract, myocardium, and many other tissues. In animals, virus is detectable in the skin before the development of symptoms.

Histopathologic changes may be surprisingly mild in victims. In furious rabies, the midbrain and medulla are mainly involved and, in paralytic rabies, the spinal cord. Changes include ganglion cell degeneration, perineural and perivascular mononuclear cell infiltration, neuronophagia, and the formation of glial nodules. Negri bodies, the characteristic intracytoplasmic inclusion bodies, are viral factories containing RNA and accumulated viral proteins.

In unvaccinated patients with rabies encephalomyelitis, no antibody response is detectable in serum or cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) until the second week of illness and may not appear before death. Experimentally, neutralizing antibody in the brain is associated with survival. After vaccination, viral glycoprotein induces neutralizing antibody, which is protective against disease.

#### **CLINICAL FEATURES**

#### **Clinical Manifestations**

The incubation period is usually between 20 and 60 days (extreme range, 4 days to >19 years). Relatively short incubation periods are observed after facial and severe multiple bites ([Fig. 38.1.1](#page-2-0)). The prodromal symptom most suggestive of rabies encephalitis is paresthesia, especially itching, at the site of the healed bite wound ([Fig. 38.1.2\)](#page-2-1). Other early symptoms include fever, mood changes, and non-specific upper respiratory tract or gastrointestinal symptoms. At this stage, patients may be referred to a wide range of different specialists, including otolaryngologists and psychiatrists. The determinants of the clinical forms of rabies, furious (agitated) and paralytic (dumb), are unknown, but both viral and host factors, and also previous vaccination, are suspected to be implicated.

#### Furious Rabies

Furious rabies[5](#page--1-5) is the more commonly recognized presentation. After a few days of prodromal symptoms, the pathognomonic symptom and sign of hydrophobia or aerophobia develops [\(Fig.](#page-2-2) [38.1.3](#page-2-2)). A series of forceful, jerky, inspiratory spasms is provoked either by attempts to drink water or by a draft of air on the face. Both reflexes are associated with a compelling, but inexplicable,

<span id="page-2-3"></span>terror. Splashing water on the skin, irritation of the respiratory tract, or, by conditioning, the sight, sound, or even the mention of water may provoke a hydrophobic spasm. Patients also experience episodic generalized arousal during which they become wild, hallucinated, and sometimes aggressive. During lucid intervals, they cerebrate normally and are aware of their terrible predicament. Neurologic abnormalities include meningism, cranial nerve lesions, upper motor neuron lesions, fasciculation, and involuntary movements. Generalized hyperesthesia or hyperacusis is described. Sweating, hypersalivation [\(Fig. 38.1.4\)](#page-2-3), lacrimation, fluctuating blood pressure and body temperature, diabetes insipidus and, rarely, inappropriate secretion of anti-diuretic hormone suggest disturbances of the hypothalamus. Lesions of the amygdaloid nuclei probably account for increased libido, priapism, and spontaneous orgasms. Without intensive care, most patients die within a few days of developing hydrophobia. About a third of patients die during a hydrophobic spasm, whereas the others lapse into coma with various abnormalities of respiratory rhythm.

#### Paralytic Rabies

Paralytic rabies is less distinctive and is undoubtedly underdiagnosed[.5](#page--1-5) Almost all cases of rabies transmitted by vampire and other bats in the Americas were of this type. After the usual prodromal symptoms, especially fever, headache, and local paresthesia, flaccid paralysis develops (usually in the bitten limb) and ascends symmetrically or asymmetrically with pain and fasciculation in the affected muscles and mild sensory disturbance. Paraplegia and sphincter involvement then develop and finally fatal paralysis of deglutitive and respiratory muscles. Hydrophobia is rare. Patients may survive for a month, even without intensive care.

#### Complications of Prolonged Survival

Patients with rabies whose lives are prolonged by intensive care may develop a wide range of complications[,5](#page--1-5) including aspiration pneumonia, pneumothorax, respiratory failure, cardiac arrhythmias, hypotension, pulmonary edema, myocarditis with congestive cardiac failure, generalized convulsions, cerebral edema, polyneuropathy, and hematemesis associated with ulceration or tears in the mucosa of the upper gastrointestinal tract.

#### Infections by Rabies-Related Viruses

These (see [Table 38.1.1](#page-1-0)) are clinically indistinguishable from classic rabies genotype/species 1 encephalomyelitis, but they are unlikely to be distinguished from classic rabies,[6](#page--1-1) as diagnosis is almost always clinical in Asia and Africa. The diagnostic rabies immunofluorescent antigen test (IFAT) may be weakly positive or negative. Few laboratories are equipped to identify other species.

#### **PATIENT EVALUATION, DIAGNOSIS, AND DIFFERENTIAL DIAGNOSIS**

Rabies should be suspected in any patient who develops neurologic symptoms more than a week after being bitten by a mammal, but there may be no history of exposure, especially after bat contact. Vampire bat bites are painless, occurring at night on exposed areas, often on toes or ears. Rabies is frequently misdiagnosed. In patients with furious rabies, the alteration in mood, hallucinations, and bizarre behavior may raise suspicions of psychiatric disease, hysteria, malingering, or rabies phobia. Other patients are referred to otolaryngologists. The spasms of tetanus may resemble hydrophobia, especially if they involve the pharyngeal muscles (cephalic tetanus), but in tetanus, there is a background of increased muscle tone (rigidity)*.* The combination of severe brainstem encephalitis with full consciousness in rabies is rare in other encephalitides but has been described in serum sickness encephalopathy. Various poisons, drugs, and plant toxins, including strychnine, phenothiazines, atropine-like compounds, cannabis, and ethanol, can produce syndromes of muscle spasm, agitation, hallucinations, psychiatric disturbances, signs of autonomic nervous system stimulation, and convulsions. Paralytic rabies should be considered in patients with rapidly ascending (Landry type) flaccid paralysis, suspected Guillain–Barré syndrome, and transverse myelitis. Poliomyelitis is distinguished by its lack of sensory abnormalities. *Cercopithecine herpesvirus* encephalomyelitis, very rarely transmitted by monkey bites, has an incubation period of only a few days.

#### **Diagnosis**

In humans, rabies encephalomyelitis can be confirmed rapidly during life by tests on skin biopsy or saliva samples ([Table 38.1.2](#page-3-4))[.2](#page--1-2) Reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR)–based tests are sensitive but not as specific or as sensitive as IFAT on skin biopsies. Rabies virus may be isolated early in the illness, before antibody appears. Pleocytosis may be absent initially. Brain imaging gives variable results.

#### **Prognosis**

In unvaccinated people, infection with canine rabies virus remains universally fatal. However, incompletely vaccinated patients treated with intensive care have survived months or years but with profound neurologic impairment[.7](#page--1-6) The diagnosis in these patients is usually made serologically; virus was isolated from only one patient; and antigen tests are rarely positive.

Three patients have, however, recovered from rabies to lead independent lives. A boy bitten by a bat in Ohio in 1970 was vaccinated with duck embryo vaccine, treated with intensive care, and made a complete recovery. In Turkey, a man bitten by a dog had one dose of vaccine and developed symptoms of rabies. After being in hospital for 2 days, he began to improve spontaneously, without any specific care. Rabies-neutralizing antibody was detected when he was first tested, within a week of onset[.8](#page--1-7) The only unvaccinated patient to survive rabies was bitten by a bat in Milwaukee, Wisconsin, in 2004[.9](#page--1-8) She developed typical encephalomyelitis, without hydrophobia. Rabies antibody was already detectable on the sixth day of illness. After intensive care treatment (ICT), including coma induction and non-specific anti-viral therapy, she recovered with only minimal neurologic deficits. These three patients are all likely to have had antibody at an early stage of the disease, and treatment probably maintained vital functions until their immune response, including neutralizing antibody, eliminated the virus, with some loss of infected neurons. American bat rabies viruses may be less pathogenic than canine and other terrestrial mammal strains—although they are all species/genotype 1 viruses, they form a genetically distinct group.

Rabies was suspected in two girls with undiagnosed encephalitis in the United States. Both had low levels of immunofluorescent (IF) rabies antibody, but all other tests were negative. Both patients recovered, and the diagnosis of rabies was not confirmed. The rabies IF serology test cross-reacts with those of other encephalitic viruses.[10](#page--1-9)

#### **TREATMENT AND PREVENTION**

Experimentally, no treatment has proved effective, and several other patients, bitten by bats or dogs, were treated with the Milwaukee ICT regimen without recovery. Hence, unvaccinated patients infected by dog rabies should be given palliation with heavy sedation and analgesia to relieve the agonizing symptoms and post-exposure prophylaxis offered to contacts. Previously vaccinated patients given ICT have a remote chance of survival, but with severe neurologic sequelae. ICT should, however, be considered for those with

Otherwise, it is advisable and humane to provide palliative care[.8](#page--1-7) In the future, effective anti-viral methods may be discovered.

#### **Pre-Exposure Prophylaxis**

Immunization is recommended for anyone at risk of exposure to infection[,11](#page--1-11) for example, veterinarians, laboratory workers, dog catchers, zoologists, conservationists, other field workers, cave explorers, and people visiting or resident in dog rabies–enzootic countries. An intramuscular (IM) dose of tissue culture vaccine ([Table](#page-4-3) [38.1.3](#page-4-3)) is given on days 0, 7, and 28[.12](#page--1-12) The final dose can be advanced toward day 21 if necessary, but the antibody level may wane more rapidly. If vaccine is scarce or unaffordable, an alternative intradermal (ID) dose of 0.1 mL over the deltoid is immunogenic and also economical if more than one person can be immunized on the same day. This has been previously used in the United States, and pharmaceutical regulations might permit its re-introduction. ID preexposure immunization should not be used for immunosuppressed people or those taking chloroquine medication. In 2018 the WHO recommended shortened pre-exposure regimens to 2 visits on days 0 and 7: either an IM dose or two-site ID vaccination.[13](#page--1-10)

Booster doses are given according to the level of risk, from every 6 months in some laboratory workers, to 5 years if lower risk—for example, animal handlers. If neutralizing antibody is detectable, boosting is unnecessary. Boosters are not normally recommended for travelers, but if vaccine is unlikely to be available in case of exposure—for example, on an expedition to remote areas, a booster dose is advisable before departure. After possible exposure, post-exposure booster vaccination is always needed urgently, but rabies immunoglobulin (RIG) is not required. Rabies vaccine regimens may change as new data emerge, and so check the latest World Health Organization (WHO) or Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) recommendations.

Human diploid cell vaccine (Sanofi Pasteur, Lyon, France) and purified chick embryo cell vaccine (Rabavert/Rabipur; Novartis) are used in the United States. Purified Vero cell vaccine (Verorab; Sanofi Pasteur) may be also available elsewhere, but a single-dose vial contains 0.5 mL, whereas the other two are in 1-mL vials. See text for vaccine regimens.

<span id="page-4-2"></span>Rabies immunoglobulin (RIG) is most important for severe rabies exposure (bites on the head, neck, or hands, or multiple bites). Injection into and around the wound should neutralize the virus, providing some protection during the first week until the vaccine induces immunity. (For multiple wounds, dilute in sterile saline). If local infiltration is anatomically impossible, give the rest intramuscularly at a site remote from the vaccine, but not into gluteal tissue. The dose of 20 units/kg body weight of human RIG (or 40 units/kg equine RIG in some countries) must not be exceeded.

#### **Post-Exposure Prophylaxis**

To evaluate the risk of exposure, ask about local rabies epidemiology; the appearance, behavior, fate, and vaccination status of the animal involved; and the precise nature and severity of the wounds (see [Table 38.1.3](#page-4-3)). Unusual contact with a bat anywhere should be considered a possible exposure. If treatment is indicated, start immediately, even if the incident was many months ago.

#### Local Measures

Bite wounds, scratches, or abrasions that may have been contaminated by infected saliva should be scrubbed with soap or detergent and rinsed energetically, using analgesia if necessary. Wounds should be irrigated with povidone–iodine. Suturing should be avoided or delayed wherever possible. The risk of other pathogens associated with mammal bites, especially tetanus, should be considered. Intact skin is a barrier to infection, but lesions from bats may be undetectable.

Specific prophylaxis aims to deliver rabies-neutralizing antibody rapidly to the wound site. Passive immunization with RIG provides immediate temporary therapy until the active immune response to primary vaccination appears. Cell culture vaccines (see [Table](#page-4-3) [38.1.3](#page-4-3)) are recommended, but obsolete suckling mouse brain vaccine is still used in Algeria.

#### Post-Exposure Vaccine

The IM post-exposure (Essen) vaccine regimen is now modified to 4 doses: one vial injected into the deltoid or anterolateral thigh area (not the gluteal region) on days 0, 3, 7 and between 14 and 28 days[.13](#page--1-10) Delaying the final dose until day 28 is predicted to enhance and prolong the antibody response. An alternative four-dose Zagreb IM regimen is two doses on day 0 and one dose on days 7 and 21.

A new economical post-exposure four-site ID regime[n11,13,14](#page--1-11) is as immunogenic as the five-dose IM regimen. It uses a whole vial of vaccine, divided between four ID injections over the deltoid and either the thigh or suprascapular areas on day 0. The volume per site is about 0.1 mL for vaccines containing 0.5 mL/vial, and the equivalent dose for vaccines of 1 mL/ vial is 0.2 mL. On day 7, two ID injections (0.1/ 0.2 mL as noted earlier) are followed by a single ID dose on day 28. Omitting the final dose of this highly immunogenic regimen results in a one-week:twovisit economical regimen for healthy patients[.14](#page--1-13) If immunosuppressed, the day 28 dose should be given. A different two-site ID post-exposure regimen is ID doses at two sites on days 0, 3, 7, and 28[.12,13](#page--1-12)

Vials of vaccine can be shared, but remaining vaccine must be kept in the fridge and discarded at the end of the day.

Those who have received pre- or post-exposure vaccination previously do not require passive immunization. If they are then exposed to rabies, IM cell culture vaccine is given on days 0 and 3. An alternative, single-day regimen requires only one vial of vaccine divided between four ID injections over the deltoid and the thigh or suprascapular areas (the same as the initial dose of the four-site ID post-exposure regimen). If a 1-mL/vial vaccine is used, sharing between two is adequately immunogenic as booster vaccination.[11,12,13](#page--1-11)

Passive immunization is recommended only with primary post-exposure treatments after major Category III exposure (see [Table 38.1.3](#page-4-3)).

#### Efficacy of Post-Exposure Prophylaxis

Combined active and passive immunization given on the day of the bite, with optimum wound care, can reduce the risk of rabies from 15% to 60% in untreated cases to practically 0%. The risk varies with the biting species, the site, and severity of the bite. Prophylaxis may fail if treatment is delayed, incomplete, or the vaccinee is immunosuppressed. Rabies vaccines may be less effective against phylogroup I rabies–related viruses and are ineffective against Mokola virus. Pre-exposure immunization has proved universally effective if followed by post-exposure booster vaccination.
