# **<sup>53</sup> 53** Lymphogranuloma Venereum

*Christian Kleine, August Stich*

## KEY FEATURES

- • Lymphogranuloma venereum (LGV) is a sexually transmitted disease caused by the invasive intracellular bacteria *Chlamydia trachomatis* serovars L1, L2, and L3.
- • LGV is a systemic disease with an aggressive nature and initially presents as a transient, painless genital papule or ulcer leading to excessive regional lymphadenopathy, sometimes even resulting in lymphedema or elephantiasis.
- • LGV is a leading cause of proctitis or proctocolitis in men having sex with men (MSM).
- • Diagnosis is best done by polymerase chain reaction (PCR).
- • Doxycycline 100 mg bid for 21 days is the treatment of choice, and is highly effective when given early in the course of the disease.

#### **INTRODUCTION**

Lymphogranuloma venereum (LGV), along with gonorrhea, syphilis, chancroid, and donovanosis, is one of the five classic venereal diseases. There is considerable confusion about terminology, especially between donovanosis and LGV ([Table 53.1\)](#page-1-0).

#### **EPIDEMIOLOGY**

#### **Geographic Distribution**

LGV has a worldwide distribution but is more prevalent in tropical and subtropical areas. In the last decade LGV has emerged in developed countries in North America, Europe, and Australia where recent outbreaks have been reported among men having sex with men (MSM)[.1,2](#page-2-0) LGV remains endemic in parts of Africa, India, Southeast Asia, the Caribbean, and Brazil. Prevalence depends on the quality of diagnostic facilities, sexual preferences, and the training of health care personnel.

#### **Transmission**

LGV is a sexually transmitted infection (STI). Major sources are asymptomatic carriers, especially women with LGV endocervicitis. The frequency of infection after exposure seems to be relatively low, although the actual risk of infection is unknown. Extragenital transmission, mostly in laboratory infections, occasionally occurs. Autoinfection (conjunctivitis) is possible.

LGV is six times more frequently observed in men. However, delayed complications, such as lymphedema or rectal strictures, are more commonly reported among women. LGV in MSM can resemble inflammatory bowel disease presenting with rectal ulceration, bleedings, tenesmus, and lower abdominal cramping, as well as perirectal abscesses and fissures.

The destruction of mucous membranes at the port of invasion seems to be a predominant factor in the transmission of HIV.

#### **ETIOLOGY AND PATHOLOGY**

A relationship between inguinal buboes and granulomas was first observed in the 18th century. The first description of LGV was by Wallace in 1833. With the introduction of the first serologic tests for venereal diseases by Wassermann in 1906, separation of syphilis from other ulcerative STIs became possible. The first full description of LGV was given in 1913 by Durand, Nicolas, and Favré. The introduction of an intradermal skin test by Frei in 1925 allowed a distinct diagnosis of lesions, formerly called *climatic* or *tropical bubo,* and connected the late complications of elephantiasis and rectal stricture with LGV. With the isolation and culture of *Chlamydiae* in the 1930s and the introduction of specific serologic tests in the 1960s, the natural history of LGV could be fully described. Advances in immunology and molecular biology in the last decades of the 20th century led to a new understanding of the disease. DNA amplification tests began to replace cell culture as the gold standard of diagnosis.

*Chlamydiae* are highly specialized, obligate, intracellular gramnegative bacteria with a unique reproductive cycle (see Chapter 52). Whereas the other serovars of *C. trachomatis* all produce superficial epithelial infections of mucous membranes in the eyes, genitalia, or respiratory system, serovars L1–L3 (the "LGV strains") display a distinct invasive behavior in lymphatic tissue. They grow rapidly in cell culture, show enhanced resistance to phagocytosis, and kill mice after intracerebral inoculation.

LGV is primarily a lymphatic disease. *Chlamydia* gain access to lymphatic vessels through microtrauma of the skin or mucous membranes. Being partly the result of an excessive T-cell–mediated immune response, the leading pathologic feature of LGV is a progressive thrombolymphangitis. Endothelial cells along the lymphatic vessel walls proliferate, finally causing stenosis and obstruction, and the inflammatory reaction spreads to the surrounding tissue. Regional lymph nodes are invaded by neutrophils and mononuclear macrophages, leading to granuloma formation and the characteristic three- or four-cornered "stellate" microabscesses, finally resolving in progressive fibrosis and scarring. Although the immune system is capable of suppressing chlamydial replication, it usually cannot completely eradicate the organism that can persist for decades in local lesions[.3](#page-2-1)

#### **CLINICAL FEATURES**

LGV is a systemic disease with three distinct stages. The clinical features vary according to gender and sexual practices of the patient. Immunosuppression—for example, underlying HIV disease—seems to result in more severe and prolonged symptoms.

#### **Primary Lymphogranuloma Venereum**

A small papule, erosion, or ulcer develops at the site of infection (usually penis, labia, vulva, or cervix) after an incubation period varying from 3 to 30 days. The initial lesion is inconspicuous and may resemble herpes simplex infection, but is usually painless. It is more often seen in men, with a ratio of four men to every woman, and heals spontaneously after a few days.

Other locations of primary LGV are the anus, rectum, or urethra. Extragenital manifestations are rare—the best known being a conjunctivitis with pre-auricular lymphadenopathy and lymphedema

<span id="page-1-1"></span>of the eyelid (Parinaud's oculoglandular syndrome), usually after autoinfection. Reactive polyarthropathy also exists, with the most commonly affected joints being wrists, knees, ankles, or elbows.

#### **Secondary Lymphogranuloma Venereum**

From the site of the primary lesion, the infection reaches the neighboring lymph nodes, resulting in an extensive inflammation of the regional lymphatic tissue. This feature is often the first noted presentation of the disease and seen at a time when the primary lesion has already healed.

#### **Inguinal Syndrome**

If the port of entry were the outer genitals either in women or men, most commonly, patients present with an "inguinal syndrome," a painful inguinal lymphadenopathy that usually develops 2 to 6 weeks after the initial infection. The inflammation starts unilaterally but tends to spread to the other side in about a third of cases. Progressive periadenitis involves the overlying skin. Small abscesses coalesce, forming buboes that may rupture spontaneously. Multiple fistulae and sinuses break open and discharge purulent fluid. The enlargement of lymph nodes above and below the inguinal ligament results in a characteristic "groove sign" [\(Fig. 53.1](#page-1-1)). After several months, spontaneous healing occurs, leaving extensive scars and masses of fibrotic granulomatous tissue. Relapse occurs in about 20% of untreated cases.

Constitutional symptoms are common during the secondary stage of LGV, indicating dissemination of the infection. Fever, malaise, and myalgia are reported by most patients. Meningism, arthralgia, and other extra-genital manifestations are less frequent. Severe systemic infection after hematogenous spread is usually a feature of severely immunosuppressed patients. The inguinal syndrome, together with a fulminant septic presentation and fever, can be indistinguishable from bubonic plague.

#### **Anorectal Syndrome**

An LGV-associated anorectal syndrome is most commonly reported in MSM. Patients present with a hemorrhagic proctitis or proctocolitis resembling histologically chronic ulcerative (inflammatory) bowel disease[.4](#page-2-2) Extensive lymphadenopathy may develop in the pelvic, obturator, or iliac area, leading to complaints of lower abdominal or back pains. When left untreated, the condition may result in rectal fistulae, perirectal abscess formation, adhesion of the rectum to the pelvic wall, and rectal strictures, usually with a long and tubular appearance. The anorectal syndrome mostly is not seen together with the inguinal syndrome.

#### **Tertiary Lymphogranuloma Venereum**

Late complications of untreated LGV may appear months or years after the initial infection in about 25% of inappropriately treated patients. Obstruction of lymphatic vessels results in lymphedema and elephantiasis of the external genitalia and sometimes the lower limbs. Patients with these presentations are rare except in areas with very limited health facilities.

#### **DIAGNOSIS**

## **Microscopic Diagnosis**

LGV cannot be diagnosed exclusively on clinical grounds; specialized laboratory examinations are required. Smears, scrapings, aspirated material, or biopsies can be Giemsa-stained and examined for inclusion bodies in the cytoplasm of macrophages or stellate abscesses in tissue sections. Microscopic examination has a low sensitivity and specificity that can be enhanced by using fluoresceinconjugated monoclonal antibodies and immunofluorescence. Elevated white blood cell count in the anorectal swab (>10 per high-power field) raises sensitivity.[5](#page-2-3)

#### **Molecular Diagnosis**

Isolation and strain differentiation in cell culture is an expensive and technically demanding method that was formerly the gold standard for the diagnosis of LGV. This method has now been largely replaced by nucleic acid amplification techniques (NAAT) that enable direct pathogen detection in smears and affected tissues. The diagnosis of a *C. trachomatis* infection can be established by sequencing the *outer membrane protein A* (*ompA*) gene.

#### **Antibody Detection Tests**

Antibody detection tests are of limited value for diagnosing LGV. Normally, a fourfold or greater increase in a specific titer is considered diagnostic. Several test assays are available based on enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA), complement fixation, or indirect immunofluorescence techniques. The intradermal skin test (Frei test) is historical and no longer in use.

#### **TREATMENT**

#### **Antibiotic Treatment**

Antibiotics can stop progressive inflammation but cannot prevent tissue destruction and scarring. The treatment of choice for LGV is doxycycline 100 mg bid or 200 mg once daily for 21 days. Alternatively, tetracycline 500 mg qid can be used. Resistance to these antibiotics is not known. Treatment failure is usually a result of misdiagnosis, poor compliance, or re-infection—in immunosuppressed (i.e., HIV) patients a prolonged course might be necessary.

Should tetracyclines be contraindicated (i.e., in pregnant and lactating women), erythromycin (500 mg qid for 21 days), azithromycin (1 g weekly for 21 days), rifampicin, or chloramphenicol can be used. Comparative studies have not been done. The activity of fluoroquinolones, though having demonstrated anti-chlamydial activity (such as ofloxacin or levofloxacin), is uncertain; moxifloxacin has shown effectiveness after doxycycline treatment failure. Penicillins, cephalosporines, and aminoglycosides are not effective.[6](#page-2-4)

#### **Surgical Treatment**

Pus from buboes should be aspirated and drained, and fistulas should receive clean dressings. The severe deformities of tertiary LGV can only be treated with plastic surgery, which should only be performed after a prolonged course of antibiotics. Patients with extensive scarring should be monitored at least annually and, if necessary, suspicious lesions should be biopsied to assess for presence of malignancy.

#### **PREVENTION**

As the most common route of infection is via unprotected sexual intercourse, most infections could be avoided by using condoms. However, even in couples with steady sex partners asymptomatic carriers can occur. Screening of MSM who present with symptoms of inflammatory bowel disease should be tested for *Chlamydia* and treated with doxycycline even before test results come back.
