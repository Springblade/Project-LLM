# **127** Intestinal Fluke Infections

*Chatporn Kittitrakul, Yupaporn Wattanagoon*

## KEY FEATURES

- • Intestinal flukes are primarily distributed in Southeast Asia and East Asia.
- • Humans acquire infection by eating raw aquatic plants, fish, or uncooked snails, snakes, or frogs containing metacercariae.
- • Most infections are asymptomatic or produce mild gastrointestinal symptoms such as diarrhea or abdominal pain.
- • Heavy infection causes anemia, malabsorption and protein-losing enteropathy.
- • Small bowel obstruction or perforation are rarely reported as severe complications from the large intestinal fluke, *Fasciolopsis buski*.
- • The main therapy of intestinal flukes is praziquantel.

#### **INTRODUCTION**

There are 70 species belonging to 14 families of intestinal flukes that infect humans.[1–3](#page-3-0) [Table 127.1](#page-1-0) shows all species according to the size of the adult fluke, from large to minute. Intestinal flukes that commonly cause human infection are *Fasciolopsis buski, Echinostoma* species, *Gastrodiscoides hominis,* and *Heterophyes* species ([Fig. 127.1\)](#page-2-0). Many species have been discovered incidentally by identification of adult worms in stool after anti-helminthic treatment.[4](#page-3-1) High incidence of infection is associated with populations living near freshwater and the culture of eating raw or undercooked aquatic products. The source of infection varies by species as shown in [Table 127.1](#page-1-0). Populations at risk are currently expanding with improved transportation systems, growing international markets, and increasing consumption of traditional food dishes.

#### **EPIDEMIOLOGY**

Nearly 7 million people are infected worldwide by intestinal flukes[.5](#page-3-2) Most cases have been reported from Southeast Asia (50.5%) and East Asia (48.9%)[.5](#page-3-2) A minority of cases have been reported from Eastern Europe, the Middle East, and North Africa. Geographic distributions of each family of intestinal flukes are shown in [Table](#page-1-0) [127.1](#page-1-0). Heavy infection occurs in 15.4% of cases[.5](#page-3-2) The highest prevalence is in people 25 to 44 years old.[5](#page-3-2)

#### **NATURAL HISTORY, PATHOLOGY, AND PATHOGENESIS**

The life cycles of most intestinal flukes are similar except for the intermediate hosts. Adult flukes reside in the intestines of the definitive hosts and release eggs that are passed in stool. When the embryonated eggs reach water, they release miracidia that penetrate a snail intermediate host and develop into sporocysts, radiae, and then cercariae. Cercariae leave the snails and, depending on the species of fluke, encyst as metacercariae on aquatic plants or in fish, freshwater snails, tadpoles, snakes, or frogs. Humans or other definitive hosts become infected after eating metacercariae in raw or poorly cooked second intermediate hosts or after drinking contaminated water[.6](#page-3-3) Metacercariae excyst in the duodenum, attach to the intestinal wall, and develop into adult worms that produce eggs and complete the life cycle. All species except *Gastrodiscoides hominis* inhabit the small intestine. *G. hominis* inhabits the cecum and ascending colon.

When flukes attach to the intestinal wall they cause inflammation with cellular infiltration, ulceration, and increased mucus secretion. Heavy infection can lead to local necrosis, erosion, and hemorrhage. Intestinal obstruction can occur with a heavy worm burden. Malabsorption and protein-losing enteropathy can occur in severe cases of *F. buski* infection. Occasionally, ova or adult worms of minute intestinal flukes (e.g., *Heterophyidiae*) can enter blood vessels and travel to ectopic sites, such as the heart or brain.

#### **CLINICAL FEATURES**

#### **Fasciolopsiasis**

*Fasciolopsis buski* is the largest trematode parasitizing humans. Symptoms in light infection can be anemia, eosinophilia, dizziness, and gastrointestinal upset. In moderate and heavy infections, the parasite can be in the colon and stomach; therefore patients can have severe epigastric and abdominal pain, diarrhea or bowel obstruction, nausea, acute ileus, anasarca, leukocytosis with eosinophilia, and protein-losing enteropathy. Rarely, intestinal perforation occurs from small bowel obstruction or stricture, which can be fatal[.7,8](#page-3-4)

#### **Echinostomiasis**

The release of eggs from humans begins at 10 to 16 days postinfection[.2](#page-3-5) Epigastric and abdominal pain, fatigue, diarrhea, and weight loss are the most common symptoms. *E. hortense*–infected patients report acid belching, anorexia, headache, nausea and vomiting, and urinary incontinence[.9](#page-3-6) Peripheral blood eosinophilia was found in 2% to 24%.

#### **Heterophyiasis**

Light infection causes no clinical symptoms. Heavy infections are associated with diarrhea, mucus-rich feces, abdominal pain, dyspepsia, anorexia, nausea, and vomiting. Symptoms usually subside after 1 month, though the flukes can remain for more than 1 year and only episodic diarrhea may appear[.10](#page-3-7) Extraintestinal manifestations occasionally occur when worm eggs enter the circulatory system via the crypts of Lieberkhün and can be fatal[.10](#page-3-7) Eggs can be transported to other organs; in autopsies they have been found in cardiac muscle, spinal cord, or brain, where they become trapped and elicit granulomatous lesions and fibrosis. Myocarditis, transverse myelitis, and loss of sensory motor and function have been reported.

## **Gastrodiscoidiasis**

Different from other intestinal flukes, *G. hominis* inhabits the cecum and ascending colon; mucous diarrhea is the main symptom[.11](#page-3-8)

<span id="page-2-0"></span>**Fig. 127.1** Intestinal flukes. (A) *Heterophyes heterophyes.* (B) *Artyfechinostomum.* (C) *Gastrodiscoides hominis.* (D) *Fasciolopsis buski.*

Headache and epigastric pain are possible reactions to metabolites released by the parasite.

Other species that cause fatal complications are *Spelotrema brevicaeca.* Fluke eggs have been found in the heart, brain, and spinal cord of persons who died of acute cardiac dilatation.[3](#page-3-9)

#### **PATIENT EVALUATION, DIAGNOSIS, AND DIFFERENTIAL DIAGNOSIS**

Blood tests are often normal in mild cases. Anemia and eosinophilia can be seen in severe cases of *F. buski.* Low serum albumin and B12 level have been reported in cases with protein-losing enteropathy.

Confirmatory diagnosis is made by:

- 1. Identification of adult worms, with specific species confirmation based on the worm characteristics. Adult worms can be retrieved after expulsion chemotherapy or from either upper gastrointestinal endoscopy[12](#page-3-10) or colonoscopy[.13](#page-3-11)
- 2. Identification of ova in fecal samples or other biofluids such as duodenal contents and gastric washing samples. It can be difficult to diagnose species because the ova are similar to others in the same family and the liver flukes. For example, *F. buski* ova are similar to *Fasciola hepatica* and *Fasciola gigantica* ova, and the minute intestinal fluke ova (e.g., *H. heterophyes, Prostodendrium molenkampi, Phaneropsolus bonnei, M. yokogawai*)

- are similar to *Opisthorchis viverrini, O. felineus,* and *Clonorchis sinensis* ova. The sensitivity of these methods can be enhanced by using the merthiolate–iodine–formalin technique.[9](#page-3-6) In extraintestinal manifestations of heterophyiasis, diagnosis has been made from egg detected in surgical specimen or autopsy[.10](#page-3-7)
- 3. Molecular diagnosis. Various polymerase chain reaction (PCR)–based methods have been developed to detect speciesspecific trematode DNA in the egg or metacercaria stage[.14–16](#page-3-12) Most of them have attempted to differentiate between minute intestinal flukes (especially heterophyids) and small liver flukes that commonly co-infect patients ingesting raw food. A study from the Lao PDR showed that PCR that can differentiate between *H. taichui* and *O. viverrini* with sensitivities of 73.3% and specificities of 63.2%.[17](#page-3-13)
- 4. Serology. Similar to most intestinal parasitic infections, serology is not routinely performed. However, in patients infected with multiple pathogens, it can be useful for confirmation, for example, *O. viverrini* and *H. taichui*[18](#page-3-14) or *F. buski* and *Fasciola gigantica.*[19](#page-3-15)

Other intestinal parasites or liver flukes can give similar symptoms of abdominal pain, flatulence, and diarrhea. Severe cases can be similar to intestinal schistosomiasis but without liver or splenic enlargement. Risk factors of travel or residence in an endemic area, or eating habits should be obtained. Co-infection with other intestinal parasites are common in endemic areas.

#### **TREATMENT**

Praziquantel is the anti-helminthic of choice. One field trial of treatment for *F. buski* demonstrated that praziquantel 15 mg/kg orally in a single dose at bedtime gave a 100% cure rate and was similar to higher-dose praziquantel (25 or 40 mg/kg) but with fewer side effects.[20](#page-3-16) *The Medical Letter* recommends 75 mg/kg in three divided doses[.21](#page-3-17) Flukes are usually expelled the next day. In treatment of *M. yokogawai* praziquantel 10 mg/kg or 20 mg/kg orally in a single dose gave 85% and 88% cure rate, respectively[.22](#page-3-18) Praziquantel 15 mg/kg orally in a single dose showed a 95% cure rate of *H. heterophyes.*[23](#page-3-19)

#### **PREVENTION**

Important methods to prevent infection are proper cleaning of raw water plants and cooking of vegetables, freshwater fish, or other intermediate hosts before consumption. Improved sanitation and hygiene will help to prevent fecal contamination of freshwater.
