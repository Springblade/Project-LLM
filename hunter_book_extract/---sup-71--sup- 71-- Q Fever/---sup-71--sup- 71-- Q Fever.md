#### **INTRODUCTION**

Q fever is a zoonotic infection caused by the strictly intracellular bacterium *Coxiella burnetii* that has both acute and potentially lethal chronic manifestations.[1](#page-2-0) The designation *Q fever* (from query) was made in 1935 after an outbreak of febrile illness in an abattoir in Queensland, Australia. Classified as a potential Class B bioterrorism agent by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention[,2](#page-2-1) *C. burnetii* has a worldwide distribution, including tropical areas.

# **EPIDEMIOLOGY**

### **Reservoir**

Q fever is a widespread zoonosis, and humans are incidental hosts. The reservoir includes mammals, birds, and arthropods (mainly ticks)[.1](#page-2-0) The most commonly identified sources of human infection are farm animals, notably goats, and sheep. Infected mammals shed *C. burnetii* in urine, feces, milk, and birth products, in particular.

#### **Transmission to Humans**

Human exposure results from inhalation of contaminated aerosols from parturient fluids of infected livestock[.1](#page-2-0) Occupational exposure is a common form of acquisition[.3,4](#page-2-2) Transmission can also occur by the consumption of raw milk, trans-placentally via exposure to blood, or through sexual intercourse[.5,6](#page-2-3) Exposure to soil and standing water has also been postulated as a possible source of infection in tropical areas[.7](#page-2-4)

### **Temporal and Geographic Distribution**

The geographic distribution of Q fever is worldwide, with the exception of New Zealand. As the clinical presentation is nonspecific, the identification of cases depends on clinical recognition and the availability of a reference laboratory. Thus incidence figures for the disease vary widely. In southern France, the incidence of acute Q fever is approximately 50 cases per 100,000 people per year; approximately 1 case per 1,000,000 people per year are diagnosed with Q fever endocarditis. Cases of acute Q fever in Europe occur more frequently in spring and early summer[.8](#page-2-5) Outbreaks of Q fever have been reported in several countries in Europe and North America; cases and outbreaks are probably under-estimated in resource-limited countries.

# **NATURAL HISTORY, PATHOGENESIS, AND PATHOLOGY**

*C. burnetii* is a short (0.3–1.0 µm), pleomorphic rod, possessing a membrane similar to a gram-negative bacterium and stained by the Gimenez method. Although previously classified as a *Rickettsia, C. burnetii* has been placed into the gamma subdivision of the *Proteobacteria,* characterizing it closer to *Legionella* and *Francisella* species than to *Rickettsia*. [9](#page-2-6) *C. burnetii* has a number of distinctive characteristics, including a sporulation-like process that protects the organism against the external environment, where it can survive for long periods[.10](#page-2-7) In mammals, the usual host cell of *C. burnetii* is the macrophage, which is unable to kill the bacterium, as it is able to survive and multiply with the phagolysosome at acidic pH. Another important characteristic of *C. burnetii* is its antigenic variation, called *phase variation*. This antigenic shift can be measured and is valuable for differentiating serologically acute from chronic Q fever[.1](#page-2-0)

#### **CLINICAL FEATURES**

Approximately half of individuals infected with *C. burnetii* will be asymptomatic, and only 2% will be hospitalized[.11,12](#page-2-8) Acute Q fever is more likely symptomatic in adults compared with children, and in men compared with women[.12](#page-2-9) Persistent Q fever is defined as infection lasting for more than 6 months and occurs in 5% of patients after acute infection.[1](#page-2-0)

#### **Acute Infection**

The incubation period is approximately 20 days.[11](#page-2-8) Three clinical presentations are typically encountered[1](#page-2-0) : (1) The most common is a self-limited, flulike syndrome. The onset is typically abrupt with high-grade fever (104°F/40°C), fatigue, headache, and myalgias. (2) Pneumonia is very common, and patients usually present with a non-productive cough, fever, and minimal auscultatory abnormalities. Acute respiratory distress has been reported, and pleural effusions may be present. Radiographic findings are non-specific and may resemble those seen with a viral or atypical pneumonia, such as that caused by *Mycoplasma pneumoniae.* (3) Hepatitis is also a common manifestation and may be mild, moderate, or severe. Jaundice is rarely present. Chronic involvement can manifest as a granulomatous hepatitis [\(Fig. 71.1\)](#page-1-0). Other rare manifestations of acute Q fever include maculopapular or purpuric rash, pericarditis, myocarditis, acute endocarditis, aseptic meningitis, and/

# **Persistent Infection**

Chronic Q fever may develop insidiously months or years after acute infection, especially in immunocompromised patients and in those with significant co-morbidities. The disease may include endocarditis and infections of vascular aneurysms or prosthetic devices, all with an accompanying poor prognosis[.16,17](#page-2-13) Other manifestations of persistent Q fever include osteoarthritis, osteomyelitis, and isolated hepatitis, possibly complicated by hepatic fibrosis and cirrhosis.

#### **Endocarditis**

Unless proper treatment is instituted, acute Q fever in patients with valvular disease, particularly a bicuspid aortic or prosthetic valve, results in endocarditis in approximately 40% of patients[.18](#page-2-14) Some patients who develop Q fever endocarditis have clinically silent and previously undiagnosed valve disease. As a result, a screening echocardiography should be performed in patients with acute Q fever[.18](#page-2-14) Q fever endocarditis is often the predominant manifestation of chronic infection and can lead to heart failure or arterial embolism.[19](#page-2-15)

#### **Q Fever in Pregnancy**

During pregnancy, Q fever is most often asymptomatic, but may result in obstetric complications, such as spontaneous abortion, intra-uterine growth retardation, intra-uterine fetal death, oligoamnios, and premature delivery[.12,20–22](#page-2-9) Although intra-uterine transmission of *C. burnetii* has been documented, the consequences of congenital Q fever are uncertain.

#### **Children**

In children, acute Q fever is mostly asymptomatic. Endocarditis may occur in children with congenital heart disease or in those with a history of rheumatic fever.

# **PATIENT EVALUATION, DIAGNOSIS, AND DIFFERENTIAL DIAGNOSIS**

#### **Laboratory Findings**

During acute Q fever, laboratory findings are non-specific and may include an elevated leukocyte count (25%), thrombocytopenia (25%), and elevated liver enzymes (85%). Autoantibodies are frequently found in Q fever, although their significance is still unknown.[19](#page-2-15)

# **Polymerase Chain Reaction**

Polymerase chain reaction (PCR) is efficient to detect DNA in both cell cultures and clinical samples[.19](#page-2-15) In addition, PCR testing is helpful in confirming the serologic diagnosis of chronic infection in patients who have persistent elevation of IgG titers to phase I titers (see later).

### **Culture**

If microbiologic culturing for *C. burnetii* is to be performed, isolation must be undertaken using Biosafety Level (BSL) 3 containment because of the risk of laboratory-associated infection.[19](#page-2-15) Shell vial culture is the best, and simplest, technique, allowing isolation of *C. burnetii* from blood or tissues, including cardiac valves.

### **Serology**

An immunofluorescence assay assessing IgG, IgM, and IgA levels against *C. burnetii* phase I and phase II antigens is currently the reference method used to serodiagnose patients with Q fever. Anti-phase II IgG titers ≥200 and IgM ≥50 are indicative of recent Q fever infection, whereas an IgG titer to phase I >800 suggests chronic infection[.19](#page-2-15) As the persistence of high levels of anti-phase I antibodies 6 months after completion of treatment and the reappearance of previously decreasing antibody titers may signal the development of persistent infection, serologic monitoring should be performed for at least 6 months after acute Q fever, especially in immunocompromised or pregnant patients and those with valvular or vascular abnormalities.

#### **Immunohistochemistry**

*C. burnetii* can be identified by immunohistochemical analysis of resected valve or liver biopsy specimens using a monoclonal antibody and hematoxylin counterstaining [\(Figs 71.1](#page-1-0) and [71.2](#page-2-16)).

#### **Differential Diagnosis**

Many infections can manifest in ways similar to Q fever, including *Legionella* spp*., Mycoplasma* spp., and *Leptospira* spp*.* or viral infections such as those caused by Epstein–Barr virus, cytomegalovirus, hepatitis viruses, and HIV. In addition to *C. burnetii,* the currently recognized agents of "culture-negative" endocarditis include *Bartonella* spp*., Tropheryma whipplei, Abiotrophia elegans, Mycoplasma hominis,* and *Legionella pneumophila*.

### **TREATMENT**

#### **Medical Therapy**

In acute disease, treatment of patients infected with *C. burnetii* should target only those who are symptomatic. Doxycycline therapy (100 mg PO twice daily for 14 days) is the recommended regimen for symptomatic acute Q fever.[24](#page-2-18) Fluoroquinolones and newer macrolides may be of clinical use and can be considered as secondline agents[.25](#page-2-19)

# <span id="page-2-16"></span>**Acute Q Fever in Patients With Underlying Valvular Disease**

In patients with underlying valvular disease who develop acute Q fever, experts suggest that hydroxychloroquine should be used in combination with doxycycline for 12 months.[18](#page-2-14) This regimen may prevent the development of endocarditis.

#### **Pregnancy**

Treatment of pregnant women with Q fever infection is difficult. Many of the drugs used to treat Q fever are contraindicated during pregnancy (e.g., doxycycline, fluoroquinolones). The use of longterm cotrimoxazole therapy has been shown to decrease the risk of placentitis, obstetric complications, and maternal chronic Q fever infection.[26](#page-2-20) Newer macrolides may also be of clinical use.

#### **Q Fever Endocarditis**

Patients with Q fever endocarditis should be treated with a prolonged course of combined hydroxychloroquine and doxycycline[.27](#page-2-21) The optimum duration of treatment is 18 months for native valves and 24 months for prosthetic valves.[28](#page-2-22) This duration should be extended only in the absence of favorable serologic outcomes. Patients should be serologically monitored for at least 5 years because of the risk of relapse.

#### **Children**

No reliable antibiotic regimen can be recommended for children. Doxycycline should be prescribed when the disease is life threatening.

# **Prevention**

A human vaccine is commercially available in Australia (Q-VAX). Prevention usually involves limiting exposure to infected animals and their products, especially placental materials.
