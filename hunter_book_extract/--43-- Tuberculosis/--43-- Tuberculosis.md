## KEY FEATURES

- • Tuberculosis (TB) is the leading infectious cause of death among adults and the leading killer of people with HIV.
- • TB is a disease of poverty, with the vast majority of cases occurring in low- or lower- to middle-income countries.
- • HIV infection greatly increases the risk of developing active TB for people infected with latent TB.
- • Multi-drug–resistant TB (MDR-TB) is on the rise and is associated with lower cure rates compared with susceptible TB.
- • Most TB involves the lung, but extra-pulmonary involvement is more common among immunocompromised individuals and children.
- • Novel diagnostic methods based on genotypic testing can improve diagnosis of both TB and rifampin resistance, but access to these strategies remains a serious challenge.
- • Pulmonary TB radiographic findings can be subtle, mimic community-acquired pneumonia, or show severe disseminated or cavitary disease.
- • Extra-pulmonary TB commonly involves the lymph nodes, pleural space, central nervous system (CNS), bones, or gastrointestinal tract.
- • TB confirmation is particularly difficult in immunocompromised individuals or children, and a clinical diagnosis of active TB and MDR-TB with empiric treatment is often necessary.
- • Combination therapy is necessary to avoid selection of drug-resistant pathogens.
- • For the first time in decades novel therapeutic agents and regimens are being tested and implemented to optimize treatment of all forms of TB; however, most people in need of these innovations are unable to access them.

## **INTRODUCTION**

Tuberculosis (TB) is an ancient infection of humanity. DNAconfirmed cases date to 9000 years ago, and suspected TB lesions have been described in *Homo erectus* bones from 500,000 years ago. Ironically, TB remains a global public health threat and has recently regained its position as the leading infectious cause of death in adults. Since the advent of effective anti-TB agents in the 1950s, TB has come to epitomize diseases of poverty: a curable disease that continues to kill 1.8 million people per year—the same number it killed in 2007.[1](#page-16-0) As TB predominantly affects working-age populations, the macro-economic impact of the disease in developing countries is also immense, with a 0.2% to 0.4% decrease in annual economic growth for every 10% increase in TB incidence[.2](#page-16-1) In fact, there is broad agreement that to achieve the Sustainable Development Goals on poverty reduction, TB incidence will need to be dramatically reduced[.3](#page-16-2)

Despite global efforts to eliminate TB, prevalence has not declined significantly, and in Southeast Asia and the western Pacific, incidence is also on the rise. These trends may be due, in large part, to "deadly synergies" with other chronic diseases—although most of the modest decline in TB rates in some settings is due to treatment and prevention of HIV[,4](#page-16-3) —and the emergence of strains resistant to anti-TB agents and deepening social inequality in both developed and developing countries.

## **EPIDEMIOLOGY**

About 2 billion people—one-third of the world's population —have *Mycobacterium tuberculosis* infection. Among the 30 countries identified by the World Health Organization (WHO) as high-TB-burden countries, 23 are low- or lower-middle-income countries as defined by the World Bank. Of the 6.34 million new TB cases reported in 2016, 2.66 million occurred in Southeast Asia (42%), 1.6 million (26%) in the western Pacific, and 1.33 million (20%) in sub-Saharan Africa [\(Table 43.1](#page-1-0), [Fig. 43.1](#page-2-0))[.5](#page-16-4)

High rates of TB incidence in many countries can still be attributed to the heavy or rising burden of TB/HIV co-infection. According to the 2016 WHO report, approximately 75% of HIV co-infected TB patients live in sub-Saharan Africa. In 2016 an estimated 7.8% of incident TB cases were HIV positive. TB remains the leading cause of death among HIV-positive people—21% of all TB deaths occurred in HIV-positive people. Broad access to highly active antiretroviral therapy for HIV has had a significant impact on TB incidence and mortality in some countries. Access to HIV testing and treatment remains limited, however, in countries in Southeast Asia and the western Pacific, with only 50% to 75% of individuals diagnosed with TB in these regions even being offered HIV testing. Rising rates of diabetes are also having a significant impact of rates of TB[.6](#page-16-5)

Another concerning trend is the increase in multi-drug–resistant TB (MDR-TB, resistance to at least isoniazid and rifampin) and rifampin-resistant TB (treated the same as MDR-TB with similar dismal success rates), which is associated with lower cure rates than cases of pan-susceptible TB. In 2016 MDR-TB incidence was estimated at 580,000 cases, but only 132,120 patients were diagnosed and only 124,990 started on treatment. Only 30% of individuals with an indication for testing for drug-resistant TB received such testing.[7](#page-16-6) The term *extensively drug resistant tuberculosis* (XDR-TB) started being used in 2007, and the term *extensively* refers to MDR-TB strains that are also resistant to fluoroquinolones and at least one second-line injectable agent.[8](#page-16-7) Outbreaks of XDR-TB have been associated with lethal clinical outcomes, particularly among HIV co-infected cases, although successful treatment of such cases has been reported, especially when using new and repurposed TB drugs. According to the WHO, in 2015, 77 countries reported 7579 XDR-TB cases, although only 36% of patients with MDR-TB had second-line drug susceptibility testing (DST) performed. However, the epidemiology of XDR-TB is greatly underestimated because DST is not available in many countries[.9](#page-16-8)

## **NATURAL HISTORY, PATHOGENESIS, AND PATHOLOGY**

TB is an airborne pathogen. A cough or sneeze from an infectious host emits thousands of aerosolized droplet nuclei that are much smaller than respiratory droplets (approximately 1–5 µm). Bacilli-containing droplets remain airborne for hours to days and are small enough to be inhaled into the terminal alveoli.

After inhalation, bacilli may extend via lung lymphatics to other areas of the lungs and to other organs throughout the body. Cellular immunity develops after approximately 6 to 12 weeks, resulting in either eradication of bacilli or the formation of granulomas around the sites of infection. This cellular immunity is the basis for the tuberculin skin test (TST; described later). Cell-mediated immunity prevents progression to symptomatic disease in the majority of infected individuals who are considered to have latent infection. However, approximately 10% of infected individuals will develop active disease in the acute setting; in such cases, the bacilli proliferate within macrophages, provoking local inflammation and progression of lesions, which can become necrotic and, ultimately, cavitary. Individuals who develop active disease within 1 to 2 years of infection are considered to have primary TB. Re-activation of TB, or the development of active disease more than 2 years after infection, occurs in approximately 5% to 10% of infected individuals over their lifetime. HIV infection increases this risk to approximately 5% to 10% per year. Without anti-TB chemotherapy, approximately 50% of patients with active disease die within 5 years, 30% recover spontaneously, and 20% remain infectious[.10](#page-16-9)

## **CLINICAL FEATURES**

The diverse breadth of clinical presentations is a result of the bacilli's ability to infect virtually every organ. Approximately 70% to 90% of active cases involve the lung, whereas the remaining 10% to 30% of cases are extra-pulmonary [\(Fig. 43.2\)](#page-3-0)[.11](#page-16-10) Up to 15% of cases have both pulmonary and extra-pulmonary involvement, although this may be an underestimate because of sub-clinical extra-pulmonary infection. Extra-pulmonary involvement is more frequent among immunocompromised individuals and children. Among patients with AIDS, up to 70% have extra-pulmonary involvement. The diagnosis of extra-pulmonary TB requires a high index of suspicion. The paucity of sensitive diagnostic methods for TB and limited capacity to sample suspected sites of involvement, in particular, in resource-poor settings, means that many diagnoses are based solely on clinical features.

Manifestations of active TB are often sub-acute or chronic, typically developing over weeks to months. Constitutional symptoms include fever, night sweats, anorexia, and weight loss. With increasing chronicity, the classic finding of "consumption," or generalized wasting, may be observed, regardless of organ involvement. However, the blunted inflammatory response of immunosuppressed individuals can result in attenuated or absent signs and symptoms—in particular, those associated with local pathology.

## **Pulmonary Tuberculosis**

Primary pulmonary TB is often characterized by lower lobe infiltrates ([Fig. 43.3\)](#page-3-1) and/or hilar adenopathy, reflecting the site

of inoculation and early spread via lymphatics. Symptoms and radiographic findings can be subtle or mimic community-acquired pneumonia. Inquiry into recent TB contacts is important to increase the index of suspicion. Immunosuppressed individuals, such as infants and HIV-positive individuals, are less able to contain the infection and therefore are more likely to present with primary TB. Cavitary lesions are frequently associated with hemoptysis. Physical findings may include the use of accessory muscles and tachycardia with a widely split S2, as well as clubbing, pale conjunctiva, and slow capillary refill. Lung auscultation can vary widely, ranging from a normal examination to focal rales, generalized wheezing, or focally absent breath sounds. A cavitary lesion may emit a hollow, tubular, low-pitched sound, sometimes producing a "waterfall" sound if fluid is present in the cavity.

**Fig. 43.4** TB adenitis. Suppurative cervical lymphadenopathy (scrofula).

## <span id="page-3-2"></span>**Tuberculous Adenitis**

Lymphadenitis is the most common extra-pulmonary manifestation of TB. As with all forms of extra-pulmonary TB, adenitis has classically been a pediatric presentation, but is increasingly observed in adults co-infected with HIV. Cervical lymphadenopathy (scrofula) is the most common ([Fig. 43.4](#page-3-2)), whereas generalized lymphadenopathy may reflect disseminated infection. Chronic progression can lead to suppuration and formation of sinus tracts. Up to half of TB adenitis cases may present without systemic symptoms.

## **Pleural Tuberculosis**

TB pleurisy is commonly a manifestation of primary disease, although it can also be seen in the context of re-activation. In many developing countries, TB is the most common cause of pleural effusions. Symptoms may be acute or subacute and include pleuritic chest pain, non-productive cough, and progressive dyspnea. Effusions are exudative, and more than 90% are unilateral.

## **Tuberculosis of the Central Nervous System**

Central nervous system (CNS) TB may present as a mass lesion (tuberculoma or abscess) or meningoencephalitis. Some estimate that up to 10% of all TB cases have CNS involvement, although many such cases may go undiagnosed or be diagnosed post-mortem. Focal lesions are often sub-acute and present with focal neurologic defects, seizures, or symptoms caused by increased intra-cranial pressure as a result of mass effect. Sub-acute to chronic in tempo (usually lasting more than 5 days), meningoencephalitis presents with fever, headache, and nuchal rigidity. Altered sensorium and cranial nerve involvement are not uncommon. Choroid tubercles may be visualized on fundoscopic examination.

## **Osteoarticular Tuberculosis**

Approximately 50% of osteoarticular TB involves the spine, although virtually any bone or joint can be involved. TB of the spine (Pott's disease) typically involves the thoracic spine and can present with chronic back pain, neurologic defects, and tender spinal deformities (gibbus). Neurologic compromise and kyphotic deformities can develop if untreated. Chronic arthritis typically presents with pain and swelling of the involved joint. Bone involvement may be associated with an overlying skin lesion. Such cases are often treated with broad-spectrum antibiotics, to which the lesion may partially respond. Progression of osteoarticular TB can lead to bone and joint destruction.

## **Other Manifestations**

Gastrointestinal TB commonly presents with diffuse ascites or abdominal pain and palpable mass caused by intestinal involvement, in particular, the jejunoileum and ileocecum. Individuals with TB-associated granulomatous hepatitis may present with jaundice and disproportionately elevated alkaline phosphatase values. The presence of hepatosplenomegaly should raise the suspicion of disseminated TB. Genitourinary TB includes renal involvement, orchitis, endometritis, and tubo-ovarian masses. Symptoms of pelvic inflammatory disease that are refractory or partially responsive to treatment should raise suspicion for TB in endemic areas. Renal TB may present with flank pain, dysuria, hematuria, and pyuria. Imaging can reveal hydronephrosis, fibrosis and scarring, enlarged ureters, and pelvic masses. Cutaneous TB may be ulcerative or nodular; lupus vulgaris, more common in women, refers to painful nodular lesions, often on the face. Other sites of involvement include the pericardium, larynx, adrenal glands, and eye (including endophthalmitis, uveitis, iritis, episcleritis, and choroidal tubercles). In many developing countries, ascites, pericardial effusions, and sterile pyuria are considered TB until proven otherwise. Multi-organ or disseminated TB may be associated with bacteremia and the presence of a miliary pattern on chest radiograph, consisting of homogeneously distributed micronodular infiltrates ([Fig. 43.5\)](#page-4-0).

## **PATIENT EVALUATION, DIAGNOSIS, AND DIFFERENTIAL DIAGNOSIS**

That the global mainstay of TB diagnosis is an insensitive assay developed more than a century ago is testament to the urgent need for accurate diagnostics. In particular, smear-negative pulmonary TB and extra-pulmonary TB remain predominantly clinical diagnoses. Among immunosuppressed individuals who present with attenuated manifestations of disease, under-diagnosis is still the norm, as evidenced by undiagnosed TB identified postmortem in 14% to 54% of HIV-positive individuals and in 20% of children [\(Box 43.1\)](#page-4-1). Diagnostic delays or failure to obtain diagnostic confirmation should not preclude initiation of appropriate therapy.

### <span id="page-4-1"></span><span id="page-4-0"></span>**BOX 43.1** Diagnosis of Pediatric Tuberculosis

- • History: persistent cough (>2 wk), fever, weight loss/failure to thrive, weakness/reduced playfulness, night sweats (older children), household contact with diagnosed TB or chronic cough.
- • Physical examination: weight/BMI for age, lymphadenopathy, spinal deformities.
- • Diagnostics:
  - • Xpert MTB/RIF is indicated as first diagnostic test in children with sensitivity slightly lower than culture. Sputum smear is rarely positive.
  - • Sputum samples of infants and children obtained preferably by sputum induction. Other methods: gastric lavage, bronchoalveolar lavage, and stool analysis. Multiple samples improve yield.
  - • Tuberculin skin test (TST) or interferon-gamma release assays (IGRA) have limited role—often negative in high-risk children.
  - • Radiology: atypical presentations (i.e., lymphadenopathy, miliary) are more common and cavities unusual.
  - • Extra-pulmonary sites: aggressive efforts to aspirate or biopsy suspected sites helpful.
  - • Response to empiric therapy may provide diagnostic confirmation.

## **Genotypic Testing for TB and Drug-Resistant TB**

The field of TB diagnostics has long been plagued by a lack of effective and efficient diagnostic tests, and until recently, most persons with TB were diagnosed via sputum smear microscopy—a 100-year-old test that misses a majority of cases of active TB—or via solid culture that requires highly functional, bio-secure laboratory facilities. That all changed in 2010 when the WHO officially endorsed a novel, genotypic test, called Xpert MTB/RIF (commonly known as the *GeneXpert*).[12](#page-16-11) Xpert MTB/RIF is a cartridge-based, automated polymerase chain reaction (PCR) TB diagnostic that has a sensitivity and specificity similar to that of solid culture. In addition to being able to detect the presence of *M. tuberculosis* DNA, the test is able to identify the presence of mutations that confer resistance to rifampicin, a proxy for MDR-TB. Xpert MTB/ RIF is especially effective in diagnosing TB in persons with HIV, children, and in extra-pulmonary specimens (with the exception of pleural fluid)[.13](#page-16-12) Xpert MTB/RIF is now recommended as the primary diagnostic tool for all persons with possible TB. It can be used outside of sophisticated laboratory settings, produces results within 2 hours, and a point-of-care version known as the *Xpert Omni* will be available in 2019.[14](#page-16-13)

In addition to the Xpert MTB/RIF, other genotypic tests to identify both TB and drug resistance are in use or being developed. Chief among these are the molecular line probe assays, which can detect *M. tuberculosis* and detect mutations that are linked with resistance to isoniazid, rifampicin, kanamycin, and the fluoroquinolones. These tests require more sophisticated laboratory support—including a dedicated room for PCR testing—but can provide rapid results within a matter of days. Previously, the tests had to be run on culture-positive specimens, but now they can be performed on sputum samples.

## **Sputum Smear Microscopy**

Sputum smear microscopy is often the only diagnostic test available in resource-limited settings. It is no longer recommended as the initial diagnostic test for TB, but it can be done for monitoring purposes in persons who have a positive smear at treatment initiation.

## **Tuberculosis Culture**

Although considered the "gold standard" for TB diagnosis, mycobacterial culture still misses up to 20% of pulmonary cases that are confirmed based on clinical findings and response to TB therapy. Sputum culture is technically difficult and is not widely available in resource-limited settings. *Mycobacterium tuberculosis* is also slowgrowing with solid culture results in 6 to 8 weeks. Liquid media assays (e.g., mycobacteria growth incubator) have greater sensitivity than culture on solid media and reduce the time to detection (8–16 days). However, contamination rates may be higher, and commercial assays using liquid media are much more costly. One important advantage of mycobacterial culture is that additional testing—in particular, DST—can be performed on positive isolates.

## **Radiography**

Chest radiography and fluorography are commonly used to diagnose pulmonary TB. Because numerous other pulmonary diseases look similar to active TB [\(Table 43.2](#page-5-0)), clinical findings must complement radiographic findings to make the clinical diagnosis of TB. Re-activation TB—more frequently observed among HIV-negative cases—classically presents with apical involvement because of the high oxygen tension in the upper lung zones. Chronic findings include cavities, fibrosis, collapse of upper lobes, and retraction of the mediastinal structures ([Fig. 43.6\)](#page-5-1). Atypical presentations, such as miliary features, intra-thoracic adenopathy, pleural effusions,

and lower lobe infiltrates, are common in HIV-positive patients. Chest radiographs are particularly useful for "ruling out" pulmonary TB before starting treatment for latent TB infection. However, chest radiographs may be normal in up to 14% of HIV-positive individuals with culture-confirmed pulmonary TB. Computed tomography (CT) and ultrasound are useful for evaluating patients with suspected extra-pulmonary TB, although findings are often non-specific and can include organomegaly, lymphadenopathy, ascites, and abscesses. Plain radiographs may reveal bony destruction or compression fractures at sites of bony involvement. CT or magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) in suspected cases of CNS TB may reveal basilar meningeal enhancement and hydrocephalus, and can be helpful in ruling out alternative diagnoses in HIV-positive individuals, such as lymphoma and toxoplasmosis. In Pott's disease, compression fractures, discitis, and adjacent soft tissue involvement with cold abscesses may be revealed on imaging.

## **Analysis of Other Bodily Fluids and Tissue Samples**

If extra-pulmonary TB is suspected, every effort should be made to obtain a relevant sample ([Table 43.3\)](#page-6-0). Xpert MTB/RIF and TB culture should be performed when available, but are often insensitive because of low bacillary load, and Xpert should not be used on pleural fluid.

## **Drug Susceptibility Tests**

In areas with significant rates of MDR-TB, regional or individual resistance data are crucial for designing regimens for treatment-failure cases. DST methods include both phenotypic and genotypic methods and are summarized in [Table 43.4](#page-6-1).

## **Tests for Tuberculosis Infection**

There are two classes of tests to diagnose TB infection: TST and interferon-gamma release assays (IGRA). Both tests are unable to distinguish between latent and active infection. The TST (also called the *Mantoux test*) involves the intra-dermal injection of TB antigens (i.e., purified protein derivatives, PPDs) and evaluation after 48 to 72 hours for the presence of a local inflammatory response. The transverse diameter of the induration (not erythema) is measured and interpreted based on pre-test probabilities ([Box 43.2\)](#page-7-0)[.17](#page-16-15) IGRAs are in vitro blood tests that measure the T-lymphocyte response to *M. tuberculosis*–specific antigens[.18](#page-16-16) Although there was originally great hope that the IGRAs could replace TST as a more sensitive test and even help monitor response to treatment, the performance of the IGRAs has in some ways been disappointing[.19](#page-16-17)

## **Empiric Treatment of Tuberculosis**

Given the challenges in diagnosing smear-negative TB, it is sometimes necessary to initiate empiric TB treatment. In such cases, TB treatment should be started if the patient reports a sub-acute history of constitutional symptoms, and radiographic and diagnostic tests are consistent with TB, and alternative diagnoses are not obvious. For individuals with chronic cough, a trial of antibiotic therapy may be attempted before empiric TB treatment. In such cases, agents with anti-mycobacterial activity, <span id="page-7-0"></span>**BOX 43.2** Criteria for Positive Tuberculin Skin Test by Risk Group

such as fluoroquinolones, should be avoided. In high-burden-TB settings, there should be a low threshold for empiric TB treatment, especially if the patient is ill or HIV positive.

## **MONITORING TREATMENT RESPONSE**

With effective treatment, patients experience rapid improvement in constitutional symptoms followed by a gradual decrease in cough and sputum production. Smear microscopy is a simple way to monitor treatment for cases with initially smear-positive disease. Sputum is generally smear negative by the end of the first month of treatment; over 90% will be smear negative after 2 months of regular treatment. Of note, because it can detect DNA even from dead bacilli, Xpert MTB/RIF should not be used for routine monitoring.

Any suggestion that the patient is not responding to treatment by the second month should trigger immediate re-evaluation ([Table 43.5](#page-7-2)). Adherence to treatment can be assessed by careful, non-judgmental inquiry of the patient, family, and providers. Drug-resistant TB should be considered, especially in settings with significant rates of primary TB and/or individuals with suboptimal treatment adherence. Patients with drug-resistant TB, even MDR-TB, may initially respond favorably to first-line TB drugs. Paradoxical worsening soon after the start of therapy may be observed. This is more common among HIV-positive individuals, in particular, shortly after initiation of antiretroviral therapy (i.e., immune reconstitution syndrome[20,21](#page-16-18)). However, paradoxical

responses can be observed in immunocompetent individuals, including up to 10% of individuals with CNS TB. HIV-positive patients may also have other AIDS-related complications that confuse the clinical picture. More than one issue can contribute to failure to clinically respond to TB treatment in a single patient. Furthermore, in smear-negative disease, confirming a definitive diagnosis can be challenging. It is often necessary to provide empiric treatment for several likely diagnoses. In patients who are clinically unstable, hospitalization may be necessary to assess the patient carefully and quickly.

## **TREATMENT**

TB treatment has been extensively studied in controlled clinical trials, which support the use of multi-drug regimens along with measures to ensure optimal treatment adherence[.22](#page-16-19) Therapy generally consists of an "intensive phase" with daily administration of at least four anti-tuberculous drugs, followed by a "continuation phase" involving daily or intermittent therapy with a reduced number of drugs. A summary of anti-TB drugs and drug interactions is provided in [Tables 43.6 to 43.12](#page-8-0).

## **Treatment of Patients With Drug-Susceptible Tuberculosis**

The WHO released new guidelines on the treatment of TB in 2017[.24](#page-16-21) Patients without a history of prior TB treatment and no risk factors for drug-resistant TB should be started on standard first-line treatment, that is, "Category I" treatment [\(Tables 43.13](#page-15-0) and [43.14\)](#page-15-1). Category I treatment is effective for almost all types of patients, including pregnant women, children, HIV-positive patients, and patients with extra-pulmonary TB. Use of isoniazid and ethambutol in the continuation phase is less effective than isoniazid/rifampin and should not be used. Fixed-dose combination tablets can simplify dosing and reduce the risk of partial nonadherence. In some cases, therapy should be prolonged. For

individuals with baseline cavitary disease and positive culture at 2 months, the continuation phase should be extended by 3 additional months. Principles of TB treatment in HIV-positive individuals[,25](#page-16-22) children,[26,27](#page-16-23) and pregnant women are outlined in [Boxes 43.3,](#page-10-0) [43.4, and 43.5,](#page-10-0) respectively[.28](#page-16-24) Most resource-poor settings use WHO criteria in determining treatment outcomes.[29](#page-16-25)

In 2017 the WHO updated guidance on the treatment of individuals with drug-susceptible TB. These recommendations stress the importance of daily treatment through the 6-month course of therapy; prompt initiation of antiretroviral therapy for persons co-infected with HIV; that fixed-dose combination tablets be used; that TB meningitis and osteoarticular TB be treated for 12 months as opposed to 6 months; and that empiric re-treatment regimens no longer be used. These recommendations also support community-based adherence support and no longer stress the need for directly observed therapy.

### <span id="page-10-0"></span>**BOX 43.3** Tuberculosis Treatment in HIV-Positive Individuals

- • All individuals starting TB therapy should be tested for HIV.
- • For cases with smear-negative disease, treatment should be initiated as soon as TB is suspected, even if bacteriologic confirmation is not possible.
- • Drug interactions and overlapping toxicities among antiretroviral and anti-tuberculosis drugs must be considered (see [Tables 43.9 through 43.12](#page-11-0)). Efavirenz-containing antiretroviral therapy (ART) with standard Category I treatment with rifampin is most commonly used.
- • The following regimens for the continuation phase of Category I treatment should be avoided because of an increased risk of rifamycin resistance and treatment failure and/or relapse:
  - • Once-weekly isoniazid and rifapentine
  - • Twice-weekly isoniazid and rifampin or twice-weekly isoniazid and rifabutin (strongest data for adverse outcomes if CD4 cell count <100 cells/µl)
- • Duration of therapy is generally same as that for HIV-negative individuals; however, if slow clinical response, prolongation of continuation phase to 7 mo suggested.
- • ART reduces mortality in TB patients. Regarding timing of ART initiation, studies support the initiation of ART as soon as possible after start of TB treatment to minimize morbidity and mortality, regardless of CD4 cell count.
- • Immune reconstitution syndrome: Paradoxical exacerbation of TB symptoms, including unmasking of clinical symptoms associated with previously asymptomatic extra-pulmonary sites. Although data from controlled trials are lacking, prednisone (e.g., 1–2 mg/kg per day for 1–2 wk then tapered) for immune reconstitution syndrome may decrease morbidity, once alternative causes (e.g., other AIDS-related complications, drug-resistant TB, etc.) are ruled out.
- • Thiazetazone should be avoided because of an increased risk of Stevens–Johnson syndrome.

## **BOX 43.4** Tuberculosis Treatment in Children

- • Children <5 yr are at risk of rapid progression to severe illness, and treatment should not be delayed.
- • Ethambutol at 15 to 25 mg/kg should be added in the intensive phase for children with extensive disease or in settings with high prevalence of HIV or isoniazid resistance.
- • Empiric regimens for children should be based on the household contact. Children should not be treated with pan-susceptible regimens if the identified index case has confirmed or suspected drug-resistant TB.

## **Re-Treatment Regimens and the Treatment of Individuals With Drug-Resistant Tuberculosis**

The WHO recommends that *all* individuals with TB and a history of prior TB treatment be tested for drug resistance, preferably using the Xpert MTB/RIF. Those with rifampin resistance should be treated for MDR-TB treatment ([Box 43.6\)](#page-10-1).

## **Adjunctive Treatments**

Systematic reviews of controlled trials demonstrate that steroids reduce mortality and long-term neurologic disability caused by meningeal TB.[30](#page-16-26) Steroids may also be used when paradoxical worsening is suspected to be caused by an inflammatory response.

### **BOX 43.5** Tuberculosis Treatment During Pregnancy and Breastfeeding

- • Isoniazid, rifampin, and ethambutol are considered safe during pregnancy and breastfeeding. Although detailed data for PZA are lacking, most consensus guidelines recommend its use during pregnancy and breastfeeding.
- • Aminoglycosides (streptomycin, kanamycin, and amikacin) and capreomycin can cause ototoxicity in the fetus and are not recommended during the first 20 weeks of pregnancy. These medications have minimal gastrointestinal absorption and are therefore considered safe during breastfeeding.
- • Limited data are available on second-line anti-tuberculosis drugs. The fluoroquinolones, cycloserine and paraaminosalicylic acid have not been associated with teratogenic defects in human or animal studies at therapeutic doses. Teratogenic defects, including central nervous system defects, from thiamides have been observed in animal studies.
- • Pyridoxine (25 mg/day) should be co-administered.
- • Breastfeeding should not be discouraged in women who are smear-negative.

#### <span id="page-10-1"></span>**BOX 43.6** Principles of Treatment of Drug-Resistant Disease

- • A majority of persons with rifampicin-resistant (RR)-TB should be treated with all-oral regimens.
- • Three drugs bedaquiline, linezolid, and a third-generation fluoroquinolone – are strongly recommended and should be given to a majority of persons with RR-TB. They have been associated with improved treatment outcomes and decreased mortality rates.
- • The drugs clofazimine and cycloserine should also be given to a majority of patients since they have been associated with improved treatment outcomes.
- • Delamanid should be given to people with resistance or intolerance to bedaquiline, linezolid, the fluoroquinolones, cycloserine or clofazimine.
- • The injectable agents KM and CM should no longer be used since they are associated with worse treatment outcomes: if an injectable must be given, it should be amikacin and this drug should only be used if there is documented susceptibility and if hearing can be formally monitored.
- • The 2016 shorter regimen recommended by the WHO can be given to individuals who qualify for it, but although it was associated with lower rates of loss to follow up, it was associated with higher rates of failed treatment, relapse and death. Therefore, drug susceptibility testing is essential to ensure eligibility and patients should be informed about the benefits and risks of the regimen, including the risk of hearing loss.
- • Consider adjunctive surgery if there is localized disease.
- • Provide comprehensive monitoring and adherence support.

In these cases, every effort must be made to first rule out drugresistant TB, which can have an identical clinical presentation.

Surgery is another important adjunct to chemotherapy in the management of patients with TB, where resources are available. Debridement should be considered in certain cases of osteoarticular

## **Adherence**

Patient adherence is the most important factor associated with successful TB treatment. Adherence is difficult because of the heavy pill burden and prolonged treatment. Patients should be educated before starting treatment about the importance of adherence and the danger of treatment failure and drug resistance. Although in the past international consensus endorsed the use of directly observed treatment (DOT), even in an absence of efficacy data[,31](#page-16-27) the 2017 WHO guidelines stress that other supportive measures can be used, with a focus on patient education and empowerment. DOT varies widely by program.[32](#page-16-28) Incentives and enablers include transportation reimbursement, cash transfers, case management, and outreach support. Nutritional supplementation can also increase adherence and may have an independent effect on treatment success, particularly in resource-limited settings where chronic malnutrition is rampant.

## **Treatment of Tuberculosis Infection ("Preventive Therapy")**

A number of regimens for treatment of patients with TB infection help prevent the development of active TB disease[.33,34](#page-16-29) The standard of care for treatment of TB infection—isoniazid 300 mg daily for 6 to 9 months—has been shown to be effective in preventing progression to active TB and has not been associated with the development of isoniazid resistance. Some studies have supported longer courses

of isoniazid treatment of infection in persons with HIV[.35](#page-16-30) More recent evidence shows that the use of a 12-week regimen of high-dose isoniazid and rifapentine given once a week is effective in treating TB infection and could greatly enhance completion rates among persons infected but not yet sick with TB.[36](#page-17-1)

Consensus on treatment of individuals at risk of latent MDR-TB infection is lacking, but recent data show that fluoroquinolone-based therapy has been associated with a 90% reduction in MDR-TB disease among persons exposed to MDR-TB.[37](#page-17-2) Some experts recommend the use of at least two drugs to which the infecting isolate is likely to be susceptible (based on contact or regional resistance data).

## **TB AND CHILDREN**

## **Epidemiology**

Roughly 1 million children develop TB every year[.38](#page-17-3) However, due to the paucibacillary nature of the disease and the limited health systems in most affected countries, these cases are largely under-diagnosed, under-treated, and under-reported[.39,40](#page-17-4) Unlike adults, infants and young children are at higher risk of becoming ill and developing severe forms of the disease after exposure and infection. This risk is multiplied in the presence of immunodeficiency or malnutrition[.41](#page-17-5)

## **Diagnosis**

The diagnosis of TB in children can be challenging: they develop the disease with lower bacillary load, specimens for analysis are more difficult to collect, and extra-pulmonary disease is more common[.42](#page-17-6) Frequently, bacteriologic confirmation will not be achieved, and empirical treatment should be started. Xpert MTB/RIF should be used instead of smear microscopy as the primary diagnostic test for children with possible TB.

## **Prevention**

The best prevention is the rapid diagnosis of adults as the source of infection, prompt initiation of their treatment, and assessment of children who are household contacts. If presenting signs and symptoms of the disease, the child should be started on treatment. If presenting no signs of active disease, the child should initiate treatment of TB infection, as already described in this chapter.

Bacille Calmette–Guérin (BCG) is a live attenuated *M. bovis* vaccine that has been used since the 1930s. It still is currently the only vaccine approved for TB prevention, although others are being studied. BCG reduces the chance of severe forms of the disease such as meningitis and disseminated TB during childhood. It should be given as a single dose as soon as possible after birth in countries with high TB burden. The vaccine's effectiveness in preventing TB decreases over time, and booster doses are no longer indicated. Due to the risk of disseminated disease, the vaccine itself is contraindicated in children infected with HIV.[43,44](#page-17-7)

## **Treatment**

The general principles of treatment during childhood are similar to that of adults. With timely initiation of therapy, children have generally good outcomes, even when infected with drug-resistant TB[.45,46](#page-17-8) However, there is a lack of child-friendly formulations for many of the medicines, and the need to prepare the pills (dividing, crushing, and mixing with sweet substances) can be time consuming and requires proper orientation for the health staff and caregivers[.47](#page-17-9) Fixed combination pills based on weight are available (see [Table 43.14](#page-15-1)).

## **FUTURE PROSPECTS**

The last 5 years in TB have seen an explosion in clinical trials, focusing on novel therapeutic strategies and drugs. Three treatmentshortening trials for patients with pan-susceptible TB in which a fluoroquinolone was substituted for either isoniazid or ethambutol and treatment was shortened from 6 months to 4 months were recently completed[.48](#page-17-10) All of them failed to demonstrate noninferiority of the shortened regimens, but other trials are being developed using agents such as linezolid and clofazimine to see if treatment duration can be reduced when these agents are included. There is also renewed interest in using higher doses of rifampicin to see if treatment can be shortened or success rates improved[.49](#page-17-11) Two novel agents—bedaquiline and delamanid—have also been approved by stringent regulatory authorities and recommended by the WHO for the treatment of MDR-TB.[50](#page-17-12) Other novel agents and vaccines are in the pipeline, as are trials looking at all-oral, shortened regimens for drug-resistant TB[.51](#page-17-13) Thus although TB remains one of the most concerning infectious disease problems in the world, there is hope that with political and financial commitment, the suffering caused by TB may finally have a chance to end.
