## Nematodes Limited to the Intestinal Tract (*Enterobius vermicularis, Trichuris trichiura, Capillaria philippinensis,* and *Trichostrongylus* spp.)

*Donald A. P. Bundy, Laura J. Appleby, Simon J. Brooker*

#### KEY FEATURES

- • These worms exhibit marked clinical differences; however, they are all confined to the gut as larvae and adults.
- • Enterobiasis (pinworm infection) occurs in children and their families worldwide; it is usually asymptomatic but can produce pruritus ani and vulvovaginitis.
- • Trichuriasis (whipworm) is a neglected tropical disease infecting as many as 500 million people in the tropics, with physical and developmental consequences in moderate cases, and colitis and dysentery in heavy infection.
- • Capillariasis is a rare zoonosis in East Asia, now emerging in the Middle East, which can progress to severe malabsorption and diarrhea due to autoinfection.
- • Trichostrongyliasis is usually an asymptomatic zoonosis of Asia and the Middle East.
- • Treatment of these infections requires multiple dosing, presumed to be due to their locations in the lower gastrointestinal tract.

#### **ENTEROBIASIS**

The pinworm *Enterobius vermicularis* was described by Linnaeus in 1758 and is found worldwide.

#### **Epidemiology**

Enterobiasis occurs in tropical and temperate regions and in rural and urban populations. It is among the most common helminthic infections in the United States and Western Europe, where it is found in children of all socioeconomic classes. The prevalence is greatest among young school-aged children, where personal hygiene and exposure to infected peers are contributing factors.[1](#page-5-0) Transmission is common within families. Anyone who handles infected children's clothing or bedding is at risk.

#### **Natural History, Pathogenesis, and Pathology**

Infection follows ingestion of eggs from soiled hands or contaminated food. Eggs hatch in the upper small intestine, releasing larvae that migrate to the ileum, molting twice to become adults and mating in the lower small intestine. Adult females settle in the cecum, appendix, or adjacent areas of the ascending colon and live up to 13 weeks, with oviposition occurring as early as 5 weeks, after which the gravid female leaves the colon and migrates out of the anus to lay eggs. Approximately 11,000 eggs are produced by each gravid female. Eggs are ovoid and asymmetrically flattened. The shell has a thick outer layer, which has a role in adherence to skin. After exposure to atmospheric oxygen and at body temperature, eggs become infective within 6 hours. They begin to lose infectivity after 1 or 2 days under warm, dry conditions but can survive for 2 weeks at lower temperature and higher humidity; the maximum reported survival is 19 weeks.

*E. vermicularis* rarely causes intestinal pathology. Worms are occasionally found in the appendix after surgical excision but only occasionally cause acute appendicitis.[2](#page-5-1) Rarely, adult worms reach the peritoneum by traversing the female genital tract or migrating through a perforation in the bowel caused by appendicitis, diverticulitis, or intestinal malignancy. Granulomatous reactions to dead worms or eggs have been found in the vaginal wall, cervix, endometrium, salpinx, ovary, and peritoneum and can be confused with tuberculosis or metastatic neoplasms. Pinworms have been found in the conjunctival sac and the external auditory canal, where eggs presumably were delivered by soiled fingers.

#### **Clinical Features**

Cutaneous irritation in the perianal region is the most prominent clinical feature. Local symptoms vary from a mild tickling sensation to pain[.3](#page-5-2) Symptoms tend to be most troublesome at night and can produce sleep disturbances and restlessness. *Pruritus ani* results in scratching and trauma to the skin and can lead to secondary bacterial infection. The eosinophil count in persons with *E. vermicularis* infection is usually normal.

*E. vermicularis* can cause vulvovaginitis in prepubertal girls and be a potential cause of secondary enuresis and urinary tract infection. Peritoneal granulomas secondary to migrating *E. vermicularis* have been associated with abdominal pain in adult women. More commonly, peritoneal nodules are found incidentally at the time of laparotomy.

#### **Patient Evaluation, Diagnosis, and Differential Diagnosis**

The diagnosis of enterobiasis requires identifying adult worms or ova. Adult female worms are small, whitish, and pin-shaped [\(Fig.](#page-1-0) [111.1 A and B](#page-1-0) and [Fig. 111.2\)](#page-1-1) and are occasionally seen in the perianal or vaginal area. To identify eggs, a strip of transparent tape, with the adhesive side out, is affixed to a tongue depressor. Before defecation or bathing the tape is pressed against the anal or perianal skin. The strip is transferred to a microscope slide and examined. Debris can be cleared by adding a drop of toluene. A single smear detects approximately 50% of infections, and 90% are detected with three. Six negative samples on separate days are necessary to exclude the diagnosis.

Routine stool examination is positive in only 10% to 15% of infected persons. Rarely, eggs are found incidentally in Papanicolaoustained vaginal smears or in urine sediment.

#### <span id="page-1-1"></span>**Treatment**

*E. vermicularis* is susceptible to several anti-helminthic drugs, with cure rates of >90%. Mebendazole (100 mg orally) or pyrantel embonate (10 mg/kg) is given in a single dose and repeated once or twice 2 to 4 weeks later. Albendazole is given as a single dose

(400 mg for adults and children >2 years; 100 mg for children <2 years) and repeated after 7 days. Piperazine 50 mg/kg is taken on each of seven successive days and repeated after 2 to 4 weeks. Because family members are usually infected, treatment for the entire family is recommended. Benzimidazoles should not be given during the first trimester of pregnancy.

To protect against infection, hygiene measures, including handwashing, particularly after bowel movements, should be done. Simple laundering of clothes and linen is adequate to disinfect them.

#### **TRICHURIASIS**

Intense infection with *Trichuris trichiura* (whipworm) is associated with colitis and dysentery, and even moderate infection can impair development in childhood.[4](#page-5-3) It is estimated that as many as 500 million people are infected globally, contributing to 640,000 years of life lived with disability.[5](#page-5-4) Transmission is via ingestion of soil or food contaminated with feces containing infective eggs [\(Fig.](#page-2-0) [111.3](#page-2-0)). The name *whipworm* derives from the morphology of the 3- to 5-cm adult.

#### **Epidemiology**

*Trichuris* has a largely tropical and equatorial distribution, where fecal contamination of moist soils allows maturation of eggs. Infection often occurs concurrently with ascariasis and has similar population dynamics (see Chapter 112).[6](#page-5-5) In many areas with latrines, the incidence of soil-transmitted nematodes is still high because of using untreated feces as fertilizer (night soil). As with other helminths, the intensity of infection in communities is uneven. In a community where the average worm burden is 100 worms, most individuals will have considerably fewer but some harbor several thousand[.7](#page-5-6) Heavily infected individuals appear to be predisposed to intense infection for immunologic or ecologic reasons and tend to reacquire infections of above-average intensity after successful treatment. There is evidence of genetic variation

in susceptibility within communities.[8](#page-5-7) Intensity of infection is age-related, with the most intense infections occurring in school-age children.[9](#page-5-8) Treatment of this age group is advocated as a costeffective approach to community-wide control because it can reduce transmission. *Trichuris* is (with *Ascaris* and hookworm) one of the soil-transmitted helminths (STH) that can be addressed through mass drug administration (MDA). Despite controversy about the benefits of STH MDA, in 2015 more than 500 million school-age children were treated, and in 2016 more than 300 million schoolchildren were treated in India[.10](#page-5-9)

#### **Natural History, Pathogenesis, and Pathology**

*T. trichiura* infects humans as its primary host, but numerous members of the genus *Trichuris* infect domestic animals. *T. suis* is a morphologically identical parasite that rarely and abortively infects humans, and *T. vulpis* of dogs has been reported occasionally in humans. After ingestion of eggs (see [Fig. 111.3](#page-2-0)), larvae emerge in the cecum, penetrate the crypts of Lieberkühn, and migrate within the mucosal epithelium. On molting to the adult, the posterior end is projected out of the epithelium, leaving the threadlike anterior portion embedded. The mature female produces 2000 to 6000 eggs per day. Eggs are passed in feces, where they mature in soil for a period that varies with temperature but is at least 10 to 14 days. About 3 months is necessary for a patent infection after ingestion of eggs. Adult worms live for 1 to 3 years.

Infection results in a well-defined humoral immune response (Th2-mediated) and IgE-mediated local anaphylaxis[.11](#page-5-10) Local eosinophilic infiltration is present in the submucosa, and in heavy infection the bowel wall may be edematous and friable and bleed easily[.12](#page-5-11) Blood loss from inflamed mucosa can be important in people with marginal iron intake.[13](#page-5-12) Heavy infection ([Fig. 111.4](#page-3-0)) can manifest as abdominal pain, chronic diarrhea, and rectal prolapse ([Fig. 111.5](#page-3-1)).

The clinical picture of trichuriasis has been divided into the classic dysenteric form (*Trichuris* dysentery syndrome, massive infantile trichuriasis) and the milder form, chronic *Trichuris* colitis with growth retardation[.4](#page-5-3) Affected children with chronic trichuriasis are more likely to be brought to medical attention because of short stature rather than chronic diarrhea. Finger clubbing and rectal prolapse with chronic diarrhea in children are considered pathognomonic in endemic areas. Severity is directly related to the number of worms present. Infection can impair not only physical growth but also cognitive ability,[14,15](#page-5-13) although there is ongoing debate about the evidence[.16,17](#page-5-14)

### **Patient Evaluation, Diagnosis, and Differential Diagnosis**

Characteristic barrel-shaped eggs (50 × 20 µm) with polar hyaline plugs in a stool specimen are diagnostic (see [Fig. 111.7](#page-4-0)). The sensitivity of diagnosis varies according to method and intensity of

<span id="page-3-1"></span>infection; light infections can be missed by single stool examinations. Polymerase chain reaction (PCR)–based diagnosis offers greater sensitivity[18](#page-5-15) but is not usually available in low-resource settings. In severe cases, the clinical picture can resemble severe hookworm infection, acute appendicitis, or amebic dysentery.

#### **Treatment**

Therapy of trichuriasis is more difficult than that of other soiltransmitted nematodes[.19](#page-5-16) A 3-day course of either mebendazole 100 mg twice daily or albendazole 400 mg once a day is usually curative in heavy infections[.20](#page-5-17) Ivermectin 200 µg/kg orally for 3 days is an alternative. A single dose of albendazole 400 mg or mebendazole 500 mg may be effective in mild to moderate infections, is appropriate for population-based treatment, and is used in school-based programs for which albendazole and mebendazole are donated free of charge. Oxantel pamoate with pyrantel and combination therapy with albendazole and ivermectin show better efficacy against heavy infections.[21](#page-5-18) Although high priority should be given to the treatment of pregnant women, these drugs should not be administered during the first trimester.

#### **INTESTINAL CAPILLARIASIS**

*Capillaria philippinensis* is capable of autoinfection and can cause pathology of the small intestine after a relatively light exposure.

#### **Epidemiology**

Most cases have been recognized in the Philippines, where the infection was first noted in the 1960s[.22](#page-5-19) Endemic areas are in several provinces where both sporadic cases and outbreaks occur. A few cases have been reported from Thailand, Japan, and Taiwan, and are expected in other areas of Asia where freshwater fish are eaten without cooking.[23](#page-5-20) There are case reports from Egypt and Iran arising from the importation of infected fish[.24](#page-5-21)

#### **Natural History, Pathogenesis, and Pathology**

Infection occurs after ingestion of several species of raw or undercooked freshwater fish that have larvae within muscle. The natural reservoir host has not been identified, but fish-eating water birds are probable. In Egypt where ingestion of raw fish is not the practice, women are more commonly infected, thought to be due to their role as food preparers. Outbreaks have occurred when fecal contamination of freshwater lagoons has disseminated large numbers of eggs to a local source of fish.

After eating infected fish, larvae can invade the small bowel, causing a chronic malabsorption–diarrhea syndrome characterized by induration and villous atrophy most prominent in the jejunum ([Fig. 111.6](#page-4-1)). Adult worms invade the mucosa and lamina propria with chronic inflammation. The small intestine can contain thousands of parasites because the adult females produce infectious larvae. The chronic, usually watery, diarrhea leads to electrolyte and protein abnormalities. Muscle wasting and myocardial degeneration ensue terminally. Death has been attributed to hypokalemic or metabolic cardiomyopathy or to secondary infection of debilitated patients.

#### **Patient Evaluation, Diagnosis, and Differential Diagnosis**

The diagnosis is made by finding characteristic eggs in the stool ([Fig. 111.7\)](#page-4-0); larvae may also be seen. Repeated examinations may have to be made because shedding of diagnostic stages may be infrequent or sporadic. PCR may be available in research settings.

#### **Treatment**

Because autoinfection can lead to clinical deterioration, infection with *Capillaria* should be promptly treated with mebendazole 100 mg twice daily or 200 mg once daily for 20 days. Albendazole is also effective at 400 mg daily in two divided doses for 10 days[.21](#page-5-18) Failure to complete the course usually results in relapse. Supportive fluid, electrolyte, and nutritional therapy may be necessary. Cooking fish and handwashing after food preparation can protect against infection.

#### **TRICHOSTRONGYLIASIS**

Trichostrongyliasis is caused by any of several *Trichostrongylus* species infecting herbivores. Humans become infected when they ingest food or water contaminated by the feces of infected animals or humans. *Trichostrongylus* adults reside in the duodenum or the upper jejunum with their heads embedded in the mucosa.

#### **Epidemiology**

*Trichostrongylus* species and related genera are common parasites of herbivorous animals, including cattle, sheep, donkeys, goats, deer, and rabbits. Human infections appear to be most prevalent in the Middle East, where *T. colubriform* is usually encountered, and in Asia where *T. orientalis* is the principal species. In Iran, nine species have been identified in humans. Using sheep or cow manure or night soil as fertilizer contributes to spread of infection in farming communities. Humans are often incidental hosts and vary in their susceptibility to different *Trichostrongylus* species. The prevalence of human infection can be 1% or 2% in endemic areas, likely an underestimate due to challenges in differentiating the eggs from those of hookworm[.25](#page-5-22)

#### **Natural History, Pathogenesis, and Pathology**

Under favorable conditions, ova hatch in the environment within 24 to 36 hours. They are resistant to cold and desiccation and survive for several months in soil. The larvae have three free-living stages, reaching the infective stage in 60 hours or more. Eggs and larvae flourish in areas with shade, high humidity, and vegetation. Infection usually follows ingestion of larvae in contaminated food or water; larvae rarely, if ever, penetrate through skin. Unlike *Strongyloides* and the hookworms, *Trichostrongylus* species do not migrate through the lungs for completion of the life cycle.

Little is known about the pathology of human trichostrongyliasis.[26](#page-5-23) The usual site of infection is the duodenum or upper jejunum. Adult worms are thought to suck blood at times and to damage the mucosa of the small intestine at or near their sites of attachment. Most human infections are mild and asymptomatic, but epigastric pain, diarrhea, and flatulence can occur. Rarely, anemia and emaciation are associated with heavy infections. Eosinophilia is present in a minority, but sometimes exceeds 25%.

#### **Patient Evaluation, Diagnosis, and Differential Diagnosis**

The diagnosis depends on identifying ova in the stool. Concentration techniques are necessary. Care should be taken to differentiate *Trichostrongylus* eggs, which are larger and more pointed on one or both ends, from those of the hookworms. The diagnosis is occasionally made by finding *Trichostrongylus* larvae in duodenal aspirates. Identification of species requires examination of adult worms.

#### **Treatment**

Mebendazole 100 mg twice daily for 3 days or a single dose of albendazole 400 mg is effective. Pyrantel pamoate 11 mg/kg once (maximal dose 1 g) can be used as an alternative. Although thiabendazole 25 mg/kg twice daily (maximal daily dose of 3 g) for 2 days is effective, thiabendazole-resistant *Trichostrongylus* strains have been identified in livestock, and the drug is associated with side effects.

Prevention involves sanitary disposal of human excreta and prevention of fecal contamination of the topsoil by infected animals. Potentially contaminated vegetables and fruits should be thoroughly cooked, and water boiled.
