# **34.3** Enteric Adenoviruses

*Gagandeep Kang, Sidhartha Giri*

## KEY FEATURES

- • Adenoviruses of species F, serotypes 40 and 41, are a common cause of gastroenteritis worldwide.
- • The main route of transmission is feco-oral.
- • Diarrhea, fever, and vomiting are common, and symptoms may last 3 to 11 days.
- • Adenoviruses have been isolated from as many as 40% of cases of intussusception.
- • Treatment is by oral rehydration with fluids containing electrolytes and sugar.

## **INTRODUCTION**

Adenoviruses are non-enveloped icosahedral viruses of 70 to 90 nm in diameter, possessing a genome of linear dsDNA of approximately 35,000 bp. The virus capsid consists of 240 hexons and 12 pentons at the vertices, which carry projecting fibers [\(Fig. 34.3.1](#page-0-0)). Their three-dimensional structure has been elucidated.

Human adenoviruses occur in 51 distinct serotypes ordered into six different species (A–F, previously designated groups or subgroups) within the genus *Mastadenovirus* of the Adenoviridae family ([Fig. 34.3.2\)](#page-1-0). The classification is based on biologic, biochemical, and immunologic differences. Within species, serotypes are differentiated by the reactivity of the two major capsid proteins: hexon and fiber. Within each species, DNA sequence homology is greater than 85%. Adenoviruses of species F, serotypes 40 and 41, are a common cause of gastroenteritis worldwide.[1](#page--1-0)

## **EPIDEMIOLOGY**

Adenoviruses cause epidemic, endemic, or sporadic infections. The main route of transmission is feco-oral, but possibly also by droplet or close contact. Enteric adenoviruses are mainly endemic, but outbreaks in hospitals and boarding schools have been reported. Most infections are in infancy and early childhood, with the incidence of enteric adenovirus infections reported to be between 4 and 7 per 100 person years in small children[,2](#page--1-1) without a seasonal preference. Adenovirus 40/41 (3.9 episodes per 100 child years) was the third most common pathogen causing pediatric diarrheal disease in a molecular analysis of a 3-year prospective case-control study of 5304 sample pairs conducted at seven sites in sub-Saharan

<span id="page-0-0"></span>Africa and South Asia.[3](#page--1-2) The incidence of enteric adenovirus infections determined in burden-of-disease studies worldwide using enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) and polymerase chain reactions (PCR) methods ranged from 1.5% to 23.0% and 1.4% to 19.8%, respectively [\(Table 34.3.1\)](#page-2-0). These differences cannot be solely associated with the sensitivity of the detection methods used, but may reflect the higher rates seen in children compared with the whole population, or geographic differences associated with areas of poor sanitation or a lack of access to clean drinking water. By the age of 2 years, more than 40% of children possess neutralizing antibodies to adenoviruses types 40 and 41, suggesting that there are likely to be many unreported or unapparent infections[.4](#page--1-3) In immunocompromised persons, adenoviruses can cause severe systemic disease.

## **NATURAL HISTORY, PATHOGENESIS, AND PATHOLOGY**

All adenoviruses grow well in human epithelial cells, with the exception of the fastidious or enteric adenoviruses types 40 and 41. Viral replication is initiated through cell attachment and is facilitated by the fiber protein, with uptake via receptor-mediated endocytosis.

Members of the immunoglobulin superfamily have been implicated as receptors and integrins, possibly as co-receptors, with CD46 identified as a receptor for species B and species D adenoviruses.

Adenoviruses replicate in the epithelia of the human respiratory and gastrointestinal tracts, as well as in the conjunctiva and in lymphocytes. Various viral factors contribute to the pathogenesis. Whereas the pentons are directly cytotoxic, early viral proteins counteract tumor necrosis factor (TNF) and apoptosis, and down-regulate the expression of major histocompatibility complex (MHC) class I molecules, thus preventing recognition by cytotoxic T cells. Adenovirus infection may persist in lymphoid cells, but the mechanism is poorly understood. A serotype-specific humoral immune response provides homotypic protection.

## **CLINICAL FEATURES**

Clinically, adenovirus-associated diarrhea does not differ from that caused by other viruses, although the duration of symptoms may be slightly longer (3–11 days). Fever and vomiting are common, and stools are watery and non-bloody (in contrast to some bacterial diarrheas). Asymptomatic shedding of adenovirus 40/41 is found to vary from 0.7% by ELISA to 1.7% by PCR[.5](#page--1-19)

Intussusception is the most common cause of intestinal obstruction among young children aged 3 months to 3 years, occurring when one segment of the intestine invaginates (telescopes) an adjacent segment of the distal intestine. It causes severe colic, vomiting, and the passage of blood and mucus rectally ("currant jelly" stool). This condition may result in arterial obstruction and subsequent bowel necrosis. In the majority of childhood intussusception cases, no clear etiology is identified, but reports indicate that adenovirus may by isolated from as many as 40% of cases. Interestingly, the majority of adenoviruses associated with intussusception belong to the non-enteric groups commonly associated with respiratory or conjunctival illness. This would suggest that intussusception is not associated with a particular adenovirus serotype or variant, but is likely to be host related and driven by the immune response to adenovirus colonization.

## **PATIENT EVALUATION, DIAGNOSIS, AND DIFFERENTIAL DIAGNOSIS**

Detection of enteric adenoviruses in fecal specimens is mainly by ELISA using species F–specific monoclonal antibodies. Enteric adenoviruses grow very poorly in cell cultures, and therefore virus isolation is not the diagnostic method of choice. In contrast, electron microscopy permits the detection of adenoviruses on the basis of their characteristic morphology. Enteric adenoviruses are shed in large numbers, approximately 108 to 109 particles per gram, and are readily detected. Adenoviruses are detected in 4% to 15% of stools from children with gastroenteritis in many hospitals, outpatient clinics, and daycare centers.[6](#page--1-20) Viral genome detection by means of PCR, which has much greater sensitivity (10–100 DNA molecules are detectable per reaction), is being increasingly used in adenovirus diagnosis.[7](#page--1-21) However, of all the adenoviruses detected in feces, only 30% to 50% belong to species F, comprising types 40 and 41[,6,8](#page--1-20) with the others being mainly members of species B and D, primarily infecting the respiratory tract.

## **PREVENTION AND TREATMENT**

At present, there is no vaccine candidate for enteric adenoviruses. Public health measures to confine outbreaks include cohort nursing of patients; use of gloves, gowns, and goggles; disinfection with sodium hypochlorite; frequent handwashing; removal of infected feces and contaminated food or water; and exclusion of infected individuals from work. Outbreaks in clinical wards may require temporary closure to new admissions and restrictions on visiting and placements of staff.

Usually, adenovirus gastroenteritis is a mild disease and treatment is symptomatic and largely follows guidelines that have been established since 1985, mainly using oral rehydration fluids containing electrolytes and sugar[.9](#page--1-22) Bismuth subsalicylate has been found to be beneficial in children with acute watery diarrhea[.10](#page--1-23) Agents used against abdominal cramping such as diphenoxylate or loperamide should be avoided, as they can have serious side effects. In severe cases of diarrhea, rapid fluid replacement by parenteral administration may be required. In developing countries where children are often malnourished, supplementary nutrition is an important component of the therapy. Cidofovir is active against adenovirus in vitro and has been used in the treatment of disseminated adenovirus infections in bone marrow transplant recipients. When it occurs, intussusception is usually reduced hydrostatically using a barium or air enema, but surgical intervention is sometimes required. An air enema is preferable to barium, which occasionally enters the peritoneum through a clinically unsuspected perforation, causing significant peritonitis.
