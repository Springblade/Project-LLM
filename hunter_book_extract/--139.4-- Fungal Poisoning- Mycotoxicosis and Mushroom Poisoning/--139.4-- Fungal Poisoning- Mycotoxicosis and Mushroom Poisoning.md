# **139.4** Fungal Poisoning: Mycotoxicosis and Mushroom Poisoning

*Hans Persson, David A. Warrell*

#### KEY FEATURES

- • Ergot alkaloids (toxic) and aflatoxins (toxic and oncogenic), derived from ascomycete fungi, contaminate food crops.
- • Mushrooms and toadstools are ascomycete or basidiomycete fungi. Most are not toxic, and most cases of fungal poisonings are not severe. However, in some Eastern and Central European countries, including Russia, and in China, morbidity and mortality are relatively high.
- • Mushrooms are not essential nutrients, but self-harvested mushrooms, considered delicacies, continue to kill people in the 21st century.
- • The priority in fungal poisoning is prevention.
- • Amatoxins occur in some *Amanita, Galerina,* and *Lepiota* species. Death cap (*A. phalloides*) causes 90% of all fatalities. Amatoxins inhibit protein synthesis, damaging intestinal mucosa, liver, and kidneys. Gastrointestinal symptoms are typically delayed for about 12 hours. On the second day, signs of liver damage may ensue. Silibinin or high-dose benzyl penicillin may reduce the toxic effects.
- • Other mushrooms cause simple gastroenteritis, nephrotoxicity, hallucinations, neuroexcitation and other neurologic effects, autonomic excitation, rhabdomyolysis, and hematological and dermatologic effects.

## *CLAVICEPS* **(ERGOT) POISONING**

The sclerotia of several species of *Claviceps,* an ascomycete fungi, notably *C. purpurea,* contain toxic ergot alkaloids that cause vasoconstriction, uterine contraction, and α-adrenergic blockade. Ergotamine, a secondary metabolite, is used to treat migraine and in obstetrics. Ingestion of contaminated grains, such as rye and wheat, and the bread made from them results in ergotism.

Symptoms include drowsiness, vomiting, diarrhea, muscle twitching, ataxia, hallucinations, and, eventually (and in some outbreaks, predominantly) burning ischemic pain and gangrene of the feet and hands—the historic "St Anthony's fire." Similar vasculitis-like effects can result from overdose of therapeutic ergot alkaloids, or even therapeutic doses in patients taking cytochrome P4503A4–inhibiting drugs, notably HIV anti-viral protease inhibitors.

Treatment is symptomatic, with vasodilators such as parenteral nitroprusside or nitroglycerin, oral prazosin, or angiotensinconverting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors and anti-coagulants.

Prevention is by strict surveillance of harvesting and milling the resulting grain, azole treatment of grains, improving baking practices, and genetic engineering in the hope of producing ergot-resistant crops.

## *ASPERGILLUS* **(AFLATOXIN) POISONING**

Several species of the ascomycete genus *Aspergillus,* notably *A. flavus,* are saprophytes contaminating agricultural crops, especially peanuts and tree nuts, maize, corn, other grains, seeds, spices, cassava, and dried fish, in Asia and South America. Important aflatoxins (AFBs) are AFB1, the most dangerous, and AFB2 from *A. flavus,* and their metabolites AFM1 and AFM2 in milk or urine of poisoned humans or animals.

Clinical features of aflatoxicosis-induced hepatitis in undernourished rural populations in India (maize diet) and Kenya (corn diet) include jaundice, ascites, portal hypertension, and fatal portal variceal hemorrhage. AFB1 is a co-carcinogen with hepatitis B virus for hepatocellular carcinoma. There is no specific treatment.

Prevention is by improving agricultural methods, including storage, and by checking AFB levels in vulnerable crops and foods.

#### **MUSHROOM POISONING (MYCETISM, MYCETISMUS)**

Illness or discomfort after ingestion of mushrooms can be caused by bacteria and parasites, as well as the primary fungal toxin, especially if they have been stored for a few days. Mushrooms may also induce allergic reactions in previously hypersensitized people, and ingestion of a surfeit of tasty, non-toxic mushrooms can result in indigestion, raising suspicion of poisoning.

#### **Epidemiology**

Worldwide, there are thousands of cases of mushroom poisoning each year, with hundreds of fatalities. Countries in Eastern Europe and the Far East report the most cases. In the United States, California has the largest number of cases and deaths. The most common cause of mushroom poisoning is misidentification of toxic mushrooms as edible, due to ignorance, carelessness, misplaced urge to experiment, or, in the case of recent immigrants, unfamiliarity with local flora. Young children tend to put anything into their mouth, including mushrooms, but usually only small amounts are ingested so that serious poisoning is rare. Deliberate ingestion of toxic mushrooms is usually for recreational psychotropic experiences and only rarely with suicidal intent.

## **Diagnosis[1,2](#page-4-0)**

The history is of fundamental importance, including specific symptoms and precise timing of their onset. Any information about the mushrooms harvested is essential: supposed species, appearance, and site where they were growing. Some fungal toxins cause typical clinical features, for example, the dreaded amatoxins and those causing distinctive neurologic symptoms. Differential diagnoses must also be considered.

Identification of the ingested mushrooms by macroscopic or microscopic examination requires the assistance of a mycologist. DNA-based methods using polymerase chain reaction (PCR), polymerase chain reaction–restriction fragment length polymorphism (PCR-RFLP), and matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization-time of flight mass spectrometry (MALDI-TOF MS) have been developed for specific identification of fungi and their remains in meals, vomitus, or gastric washings. Alpha-amanitin can be detected in urine within 36 hours of ingestion, using radioimmunoassay (RIA), high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC), or enzyme immunosorbent assay (EIA), but its concentration does not indicate the risk of liver damage. This is currently the only fungal toxin that can be detected in clinical practice.

#### **MUSHROOM TOXINS**

From a clinical point of view, the most relevant and practical way of classifying mushroom poisonings is to group them according to their toxic effects and related symptoms. Applying this pragmatic approach, the following main groups of fungal toxins can be distinguished: cytotoxins, nephrotoxins, neurotoxins, myotoxins, metabolic toxins, and gastrointestinal irritants ([Table 139.4.1\)](#page-1-0).

## **CYTOTOXIC MUSHROOM POISONIN[G3](#page-4-1)**

## **Primary Hepatotoxicity (Amatoxin Poisoning)**

Amatoxins are cyclic octapeptides occurring in some *Amanita* species [e.g., *A. phalloides* (death cap) ([Fig. 139.4.1](#page-1-1)), *A. virosa* (destroying angel), *A. verna* (fool's mushroom)], *Galerina marginata,* and some *Lepiota* species.

## Mechanisms of Toxicity

Amatoxins inhibit protein synthesis by blocking nuclear RNA polymerase II and III, resulting in cell necrosis, and induce apoptosis and glutathione depletion. Target organs are intestinal mucosa, liver, and kidneys. The most critical clinical effect is hepatic damage, the degree of which determines prognosis.

#### Symptoms

Delayed onset of gastrointestinal symptoms is typical and diagnostic. The latency period after ingestion varies from 8 hours to 24 hours (mean: 12 hours). Symptoms are violent: vomiting and intense, watery diarrhea (mimicking cholera) resulting in dehydration and metabolic disturbances. After transient symptomatic improvement, biochemical evidence of liver damage appears after 36 to 48 hours and progresses over the next few days with the development of liver failure. Early renal dysfunction is related to dehydration and improves with fluid replacement, but after 3 to 4 days, toxin-induced acute kidney injury (AKI) may develop, signifying a poor prognosis. Despite the risk of mortality, most patients survive with complete hepatic recovery.

## Management[4-8](#page-4-2)

- 1. Forced emesis/gastric lavage is indicated only if the patient is admitted within 4 to 6 hours, is still asymptomatic, and the procedure can be performed safely.
- 2. Multiple-dose activated charcoal (20–40 g every 3–4 h or 50 g every 6 h for 3 days after ingestion) should always be administered to interrupt the supposed enterohepatic recirculation of amatoxins.
- 3. A mild diuresis (adults around 200 mL/h) for 24 to 48 hours is maintained because initial renal clearance of toxin is high.
- 4. Toxin uptake in the liver may, according to experimental and some clinical data, be reduced by silibinin (a thistle extract). A bolus dose of 5 mg/kg is given intravenously (IV) over 1 hour, followed by a continuous infusion of 20 mg/kg/24 h, for 3 days post-ingestion. High-dose benzyl penicillin (300 mg/ kg/24 h) is an alternative if silibinin is not available. Potential new treatments include polymyxin B, which prevents α-amanitin from binding to RNA polymerase II, and a DNA aptamer that specifically binds α-amanitin.
- 5. Careful symptomatic and supportive care is mandatory, including fluid replacement, correction of metabolic disturbances, and treatment of hepatic and renal failure. *N*-acetylcysteine (300 mg/ kg as a continuous IV infusion over 21 h) may have some benefit for liver protection.
- 6. Hemoperfusion or hemodialysis is indicated for toxin elimination only in cases of a pre-existing renal disease, or if the patient is admitted very early in the asymptomatic phase.

### **Primary Nephrotoxicity**

## Early Nephrotoxicity (Aminohexadienoic Acid Poisoning)[9](#page-4-3)

In North America, kidney damage followed ingestion of *A. smithiana* that was mistaken for *Tricholoma magnivelare,* the edible ponderosa, pine mushroom, or American matsutake. In the south of France, some patients developed AKI-related hepatotoxicity and cardiotoxicity after accidental ingestion of meals containing *A. proxima* that were mistaken for the questionably non-toxic *A. ovoidea,* the European white egg mushroom. In these cases, AKI developed a few days after early gastrointestinal symptoms.

## Late Nephrotoxicity (Orellanine Poisoning[\)10,11](#page-4-4)

Orellanine, a potent nephrotoxin, occurs in some *Cortinarius* spp., in particular, *C. rubellus* (*speciosissimus*) and *C. orellanus* [\(Fig. 139.4.2](#page-2-0)).

![](_page_2_Picture_18.jpeg)

**Fig. 139.4.2** A common cause of poisoning by nephrotoxic *Cortinarius* spp. is confusion of *Cortinarius rubellus* (in the lower part of the picture) and funnel chanterel, *Cantharellus tubaeformis* (in the upper part of the picture). (Courtesy, Astrid Holmgren.)

<span id="page-2-0"></span>It is a bipyridine *N*-oxide that interferes with renal protein synthesis, causing interstitial nephritis, tubular necrosis, and basal membrane rupture. Symptoms develop insidiously and unpredictably. Initially, symptoms are mild or absent. As a result, patients present late (2–14 days after ingestion) prompted by symptoms of emerging renal dysfunction (headache, thirst, chills, fatigue, muscle pain, lumbar and flank discomfort). Polyuria may be followed by oliguria and anuria. Pyuria is characteristic. Renal function may not recover in between 10% and 40% of cases.

In the very rare circumstance of early admission, general decontamination procedures are warranted. The usual late presentation with established renal damage allows only symptomatic and supportive care. Renal transplantation or chronic dialysis may be required.

#### **NEUROTOXIC MUSHROOM POISONINGS**

## **Hallucinogenic ("Magic Mushroom") Psilocybin Poisoning**

Some *Psilocybe* and *Panaeolus* spp. contain hallucinogenic toxins, psilocybins, psilocins, and gymnopilins—tryptamine derivatives that increase central nervous system (CNS) serotonin levels. They are potent hallucinogens, mimicking LSD. These fungi, known as *"magic mushrooms,"* are ingested deliberately, with the "liberty cap," *Psilocybe semilanceata* being the most popular.

Symptoms appear within an hour, typically euphoria, hallucinations, altered sense of time and space, and depersonalization. Hallucinations may be bizarre and terrifying, prompting hospital admission. Other symptoms are agitation, anxiety, tachycardia, mydriasis, flushing, and fever. Organic psychosis is a differential diagnosis.

<span id="page-3-0"></span>Treatment is symptomatic. Patients are kept in a quiet room and given generous sedation with benzodiazepines, adding antipsychotic drugs (e.g., haloperidol or chlorpromazine) in the case of violent behavior or frightening hallucinations.

## **Autonomic-Toxicity Mushrooms (Muscarinic Poisoning[\)12](#page-4-5)**

Muscarine, which stimulates cholinergic receptors in the autonomic nervous system, occurs in some *Inocybe* and *Clitocybe* spp. Symptoms develop rapidly, normally within 30 minutes to 2 hours: commonly nausea, abdominal colic, and diarrhea, sometimes with diaphoresis, hypersalivation, rhinorrhea, lacrimation, bronchorrhea, bronchospasm, miosis, bradycardia, and hypotension. Patients often feel miserable.

Muscarinic symptoms are effectively counteracted by atropine 1 to 2 mg IV in adults (0.02–0.05 mg/kg IV in children). The dose is repeated as required. Fluid replacement, may be required.

## **CNS Neuroexcitatory Mushrooms (Isoxazole Poisoning)**

Isoxazoles (ibotenic acid, muscimol, muscazone) are gammaaminobutyric acid (GABA) agonists, occurring in some *Amanita* spp., for example, *A. muscaria* (fly agaric) [\(Fig. 139.4.3\)](#page-3-0), *A. pantherina* (panther cap), and *A. regalis.*

Symptoms develop within 0.5 to 1.5 hours. Gastrointestinal discomfort is uncommon, but neurologic and psychotropic effects dominate: inebriation, euphoria alternating with anxiety, confusion, illusions, delusions, hallucinations, agitation, and violent behavior. Less common are myoclonic jerks, muscle fasciculations, and convulsions. Heavy exposure, especially to panther cap, causes CNS depression and unconsciousness.

Treatment is symptomatic. Sedation is urgent*:* benzodiazepines can be given generously and repeatedly as required. In the case of severe agitation and delirium, anti-psychotic drugs (e.g., haloperidol or chlorpromazine) may be helpful.

## **Myotoxic Mushroom Poisoning[13-16](#page-4-6)**

Early Myotoxicity (Cycloprop-2-Ene Carboxylic Acid Poisoning)

In the Far East, ingestion of *Russula subnigricans,* a mushroom that stains red when damaged, causes self-limiting nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, and agitation within about 2 hours, followed a few hours later, in a minority, by generalized myalgia and rhabdomyolysis with or without hyperkalemia, hypocalcemia, respiratory failure, AKI, pulmonary edema, hypertension, ventricular tachycardia, and circulatory shock.

#### Late Myotoxicity (Saponaceolide B and M Poisoning)

Reports from France and Poland indicate that ingestion of large or repeated meals of *Tricholoma equestre (flavovirens),* "man on horseback" or "yellow knight" mushrooms, can cause severe rhabdomyolysis after a delay of 1 to 3 days. In severe cases there is progression to fatal acute respiratory failure, cardiac arrhythmias, and cardiovascular collapse. This is alarming, for this mushroom is popular and widely considered safe.

#### **Metabolic Toxicity Mushroom Poisoning**

GABA-Blocking Mushroom Poisoning (Gyromitrin Poisoning)

Some *Gyromitra* spp. ("false morels"), especially *G. esculenta,* contain gyromitrin, a volatile, water-soluble toxin extractable by boiling, which decomposes in the stomach forming toxic hydrazines. These deplete CNS pyridoxine, reducing GABA synthesis. Other toxic effects are erythrocyte glutathione depletion and hepatotoxicity.

Highly volatile gyromitrin can be inhaled during storage, drying, or boiling of mushrooms. Irritation of eyes and airways and systemic symptoms may ensue, but poisoning is most often due to ingesting false morels that have not been detoxified by adequate boiling. Systemic symptoms are often delayed 5 to 8 hours after ingestion. Gastrointestinal symptoms may be absent, with the main symptoms being neurologic: dizziness, vertigo, ataxia, sweating, incoordination, and seizures. Heavy exposure may cause hemolysis, hypoglycemia, and hepatic damage.

After heavy exposure, especially if there are neurologic symptoms, pyridoxine is given (25 mg/kg of diluted solution by IV infusion over 30 minutes). In case of seizures, give 0.5–1 g/min IV until seizures subside, or a maximum dose is reached (5 g for adults, 70 mg/kg for children). Pyridoxine specifically reverses seizures, but if it fails, a benzodiazepine should be given. Keep a glucose infusion running. Symptomatic care is given as required.

## **Disulfiram-Like Mushroom Poisoning (Coprine Poisoning)**

Antabuse Syndrome

Antabuse reactions may be provoked by *Coprinus atramentarius* and possibly other *Coprinus* spp., *Clitocybe clavipes,* and *Boletus luridus.* Toxic coprine blocks aldehyde dehydrogenase, explaining why ingestion of these mushrooms in combination with ethanol for up to a week after ingestion may result in a typical Antabuse syndrome.

Like ethanol–disulfiram reactions ("Antabuse syndrome"), there is flushing, sweating, nausea, anxiety, tachycardia, hypotension, and dyspnea.

After recent ingestion, activated charcoal and gastric lavage may be useful. Otherwise, treatment is symptomatic and supportive.

#### **Gastrointestinal Irritant Mushroom Poisoning**

Many diverse mushrooms can cause non-specific irritation of the gastrointestinal mucosae without other toxicity. They include *Agaricus, Boletus, Entoloma, Hebeloma, Lactarius, Ramaria, Russula,* and *Tricholom* spp. Few toxins in this group are chemically identified. Transient gastrointestinal symptoms begin within a few hours of ingestion.However,some speciessuch as *Entoloma sinuatum* ("leaden entoloma") may cause severe and persistent symptoms. Infective gastrointestinal infection is an important differential diagnosis, together with effects of gorging on large amounts of indigestible mushrooms. Delay of intense symptoms for 8 to 24 hours after the mushroom meal suggests potentially dangerous amatoxin poisoning.

Treatment is symptomatic and supportive. Hospital admission is rarely necessary. The age and general condition of the patient and the intensity of symptoms determine whether correction of fluid and electrolyte disturbances is necessary. Children and the elderly may be more at risk.

## *Chlorophyllum (Lepiota) molybdites* (False or Green-Spored Parasol) and *Macrilepiota (Lepiota) morganii* (Morgan's Mushroom) Poisoning

These are the most commonly ingested poisonous mushrooms in North America and Hawai'i. They contain a gastrointestinal irritant with α-receptor-blocking and cholinergic effects.

Intense gastrointestinal symptoms develop within 30 minutes to a few hours of ingestion. Diarrhea may sometimes become bloody. Fluid and electrolyte imbalance may follow and, in severe cases, cholinergic symptoms and AKI may ensue.

Treatment is symptomatic and supportive, with adequate fluid and electrolyte replacement. Cholinergic symptoms are reversed by atropine.

### **OTHER TOXIC EVENTS CAUSED BY FUNGI**

## **Shiitake Mushroom Dermatitis (Lentinan Poisoning)**

Inadequately cooked shiitake mushrooms (*Lentinola edodes*) contain a thermolabile polysaccharide, lentina, that can cause "shiitake dermatitis." This characteristic generalized, light-sensitive, erythematous, micro-papular, linear ("flagellate"), pruritic, urticarial rash appears 24 hours after ingestion and persists for 3 to 21 days.

#### **Paxillus Syndrome**

"Roll-rim cap" (*Paxillus involutus*) mushrooms contain thermo-labile, strongly irritating toxins that may cause severe gastroenteritis if the mushroom is not cooked properly. Allergens in this mushroom that are not denatured by cooking can cause hypersensitization. Repeated ingestion may provoke violent reactions: severe gastroenteritis, dehydration, hemolysis, and AKI. Treatment is symptomatic.
