### Epidemic Louse-Borne Typhus

*Pierre-Edouard Fournier, Didier Raoult*

#### KEY FEATURES

- • The etiologic agent of epidemic louse-borne typhus is *Rickettsia prowazekii.*
- • Epidemic typhus is transmitted by body lice and largely affects impoverished or displaced people in cold-weather conditions.
- • Epidemic typhus manifests as an acute febrile illness with headache and myalgia. Neurologic manifestations, rash, vasculitis, and gangrene of extremities can occur. In untreated cases, mortality is high.
- • Diagnosis is usually based on clinical suspicion, especially in the right epidemiologic situation. Serology is available.
- • Treatment is simple, safe, and inexpensive, and usually involves a single 200-mg dose or short course of doxycycline.
- • Relapses years after initial infection are termed *Brill– Zinsser disease.*
- • Synonyms include epidemic typhus, louse-borne typhus, exanthematic typhus, historical typhus, and jail fever.
- • Control efforts should focus on de-lousing both individuals and populations and providing hygienic conditions.

#### **INTRODUCTION**

Epidemic typhus is transmitted by human body lice from infected patients (during acute infection or relapse) to naïve people. It is one of the major threats to public health during civil unrest, displacement, and war. Typhus has probably caused more deaths than wars in the history of humanity; it remains a permanent public health problem, as poor sanitary conditions can lead to epidemic outbreaks, such as in Burundi in 1997.[1](#page-2-0)

Epidemic typhus may have been the cause of the Athens plague described by Thucydides, but it may also have been typhoid fever. The first account of typhus may have been recorded during the civil wars of Grenada from 1489 to 1490. In 1739 Huxham made the first distinction between typhus and typhoid; in 1760, Boissier de Sauvage quoted the name "typhus," which is Greek for "smoky/ cloudy," and refers to the mental status changes associated with typhus. "Typhoid" was an illness that had many features of typhus, but was distinct. In 1909 Charles Nicolle showed the role of body lice in the transmission of epidemic typhus; in 1910, Brill described the recrudescent form; finally, in 1916, da Rocha Lima described the bacterium and named it *Rickettsia prowazekii* in honor of Ricketts and von Prowazek, two previous researchers who both died of typhus[.2](#page-2-1)

#### **EPIDEMIOLOGY**

Epidemic typhus has been traditionally associated with wars and other catastrophic conditions that lead to poor sanitary conditions with lice infestation. It has been described as a disease of the highlands, cold areas, poverty, imprisonment, and civil unrest, when people are forced to repetitively wear the same clothing, often in crowded and unhygienic conditions; however, epidemic typhus has a potentially worldwide distribution. Incidence of epidemic typhus is highest in colder months (it mainly occurs during the winter and spring). Men and women are equally affected[.3](#page-2-2) Brill–Zinsser disease (the relapsing form of the disease) can occur up to 40 years after primary infection under stress conditions or in immunocompromised hosts. Sylvatic forms associated with flying squirrels and the presence of *R. prowazekii* in ticks suggest that reservoirs and transmission dynamics of *R. prowazekii* are more complex than previously described.[4](#page-2-3)

In 1997, a large outbreak of typhus was reported in Burundi during the civil war; 100,000 people were estimated to be infected, and the case fatality rate was 15%.[1](#page-2-0) Small outbreaks and sporadic cases have also been reported in different regions of the world since 1997, including Russia, Peru, Northern Africa, the United States, and France ([Fig. 66.1](#page-1-0)). This highlights the persistent threat of epidemic typhus. Eradication of epidemic typhus appears to be difficult because of possible recrudescence of *R. prowazekii* in infested people, which is associated with Brill–Zinsser disease, and the unknown contribution of non-human reservoirs.

#### **NATURAL HISTORY, PATHOGENESIS, AND PATHOLOGY**

In 1909 Charles Nicolle observed the role of the body louse *Pediculus humanus* subsp. *corporis* (or *P. humanus* subsp. *humanus*) in the transmission of epidemic typhus. Lice become infected when feeding on the blood of a bacteremic patient. Transmission between human hosts is associated with close human contacts; primary infection occurs when *R. prowazekii* is transmitted from the vector to the host, not by louse bites, but by contamination of bite sites, scratching lesions, conjunctivae, and mucous membranes (including the respiratory tract) with the infectious feces or crushed bodies of infected lice. These infested aerosols constitute a source of infection of typhus for clinicians in contact with liceinfested patients. In the case of Brill–Zinsser disease, recrudescent infection of the human host is associated with bacteremia; if louse infestation of the patient occurs at the same time, lice become infected through host feeding, and if appropriate conditions exist, an outbreak can occur[.3](#page-2-2)

It was previously thought that humans were the only reservoir of *R. prowazekii* and human body lice the only vectors. But since the 1950s, specific antibodies have been detected in, and the bacterium isolated from, several domestic and wild animals. Ticks might be a reservoir for *R. prowazekii,* as *Amblyomma* spp. and *Hyalomma* spp. were found to be infected in Mexico and Ethiopia, respectively[.3](#page-2-2) Of particular interest is the reservoir formed by flying squirrels (*Glaucomys volans*). Reported cases of epidemic typhus in the United States have been associated with contact with flying squirrels.[4](#page-2-3) The role of animal reservoirs in the global burden of typhus is currently not well defined. After entering the body of an infected human, the bacteria spread through blood and lymph, then they infect endothelial cells of the small capillaries. Rickettsial infection leads to endothelial damage, which is associated

with widespread vasculitis; the clinical signs and symptoms relate to the affected organs. Endothelial injury can also lead to micro- and macroscopic foci of hemorrhages. Vasculitis can also be associated with thrombi in small vessels and surrounding inflammatory infiltrates. These correspond to typhus nodules and may occur focally throughout the central nervous system (CNS); these lesions explain the neurologic features commonly associated with epidemic typhus.[3](#page-2-2) The vasculitis of *R. prowazekii* infection is generalized, and thus any organ may be involved.

#### **CLINICAL FEATURES**

Clinical features of epidemic typhus are non-specific and consequently not easy to differentiate from other infectious processes. The incubation period is usually 10 to 14 days, but may be as short as 6 days. A prodromal malaise may pre-date the onset of fever by 1 to 3 days. Onset of typhus is usually abrupt and manifested by fever (which continues until death or recovery), severe headaches, severe myalgias, abdominal pain, arthralgias, malaise, anorexia, chills, photophobia, and non-productive cough. Facial flushing and conjunctival suffusion can occur, as can nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, or constipation. During a 1997 outbreak in Burundi[,1](#page-2-0) a crouching attitude named *sutama* was reported, caused by myalgia and severe fatigue.

In untreated cases, as the illness progresses, neurologic manifestations become more common. In up to 80% of untreated cases, CNS manifestations, such as delirium that interrupts stupor, coma, seizures, and hearing loss, can occur. Rash is often present, although difficult to discern in individuals with dark skin. The rash is initially non-confluent, with erythematous and blanching areas; macules, petechiae, and purpura can occur. It begins on the trunk and the axilla and may spread centrifugally. It is not found on the face, palms, or soles, except in severely ill patients. In mild cases, it may fade in 1 or 2 days. Cough is reported in 38% to 70% of patients. Primary pulmonary involvement, as well as secondary bacterial pneumonia, can occur during epidemic typhus. In severe cases, symptoms secondary to vasculitis can provoke cerebral thrombosis, gangrene (which can require amputation), multiple organ dysfunction, shock, and death.[3](#page-2-2)

Before the development of antimicrobial treatment, mortality could reach 60%. With appropriate antibiotics, mortality of approximately 4% is now common. Severity is associated with malnutrition and advanced age.

Brill–Zinsser disease usually occurs with advancing age and waning immunity. Cases are sporadic and unrelated to recent louse infestation. Compared with acute infection, Brill–Zinsser disease is shorter and its clinical features are usually mild, although fatal cases can occur. Rashes are reported to be less frequent.

Cases of typhus related to flying squirrels are sporadic. These cases may clinically present as meningitis. This form of typhus is poorly understood.

#### **PATIENT EVALUATION, DIAGNOSIS, AND DIFFERENTIAL DIAGNOSIS**

Clinical diagnosis of sporadic cases is difficult, although clinically diagnosing a compatible case during a known epidemic is less uncertain. Taken in isolation, differentiating the clinical signs of typhus from those of other infections is not easy. This underscores the importance of obtaining a thorough history of animal and lice or arthropod contact in patients with acute febrile illness. However, a cluster of sudden onset of severe pyrexia among louse-infested people living in cold, crowded, and unhygienic conditions should immediately alert the clinician to possible typhus. Any severe outbreak of unexplained fever in unhygienic environments should also evoke consideration of epidemic typhus.

The main differential diagnoses that should be ruled out when considering louse-borne typhus are typhoid (these diagnoses have been clinically confused for centuries), murine typhus, other rickettsioses, malaria, and hemorrhagic fevers. Finally, lice transmit three diseases that must be suspected in case of fever in louseinfested patients as they can occur simultaneousl[y1](#page-2-0) : relapsing fever, trench fever, and epidemic typhus. The fever pattern in epidemic typhus is daily or continuous, whereas in the other two entities it is often more cyclical.

Laboratory findings during epidemic typhus include thrombocytopenia (40% of cases), increased hepatic transaminase activity (up to 60%, although jaundice is rare), hyperbilirubinemia (20%), and increased blood urea nitrogen concentrations (31%). Oliguria and proteinuria are common. In the early phase, leukopenia can be observed.

#### <span id="page-2-6"></span>**BOX 66.1** Pediatric Considerations

The standard treatment regimen for children is a single 100-mg doxycycline dose. Any suspected case should be treated immediately. A single dose or short course of doxycycline in young children poses only a small risk of teeth staining, and that risk needs to be weighed against the high mortality associated with advanced disease. No particular clinical or epidemiologic feature distinguishes epidemic typhus in children from that in adults.

The reference method for diagnosis is serologic testing using an indirect immunofluorescence assay. Fresh blood, as well as blood dried on blotting paper, can be used. Both acute- and convalescent-phase serum should be assayed. However, there is cross-reactivity mainly with *R. typhi.* Western blotting with crossadsorption is required to differentiate between these typhus group *Rickettsia* and to diagnose epidemic typhus rather than endemic typhus. It is also difficult to differentiate between primary infection and Brill–Zinsser disease solely based on serologic results. Usually in Brill–Zinsser disease, no specific IgM are recovered, but the diagnosis cannot solely be based on this feature.[3](#page-2-2)

Cell culture can be used to isolate *R. prowazekii* from samples, but this approach is not clinically practical and requires Biosafety Level-3 laboratories with an experienced staff. Molecular detection of *R. prowazekii* has been developed and is becoming increasingly clinically useful. Real-time polymerase chain reaction assays are especially useful, because they are rapid, sensitive, and specific[.5](#page-2-4) Molecular detection can be performed on several types of human samples (blood, skin biopsy, etc.) and also on lice (which can be sent dry or in alcohol). The latter approach can be particularly helpful in cases of possible typhus outbreaks because detection of rickettsial DNA in lice can indicate extant human typhus (*R. prowazekii* is pathogenic for lice and provokes rapid death of lice; therefore if rickettsial DNA is detected in lice, it corresponds to an active and extensive outbreak).

#### **TREATMENT**

The treatment of typhus is safe, easy, and inexpensive. A single dose of 200 mg of orally administered doxycycline will usually cure patients.[6](#page-2-5) Early administration must be prescribed in any suspected case without waiting for laboratory confirmation. The absence of clinical response within 2 to 3 days of treatment strongly argues against louse-borne typhus. A 5-day therapy or a therapy lasting for 2 to 4 days after defervescence is often administered to preclude relapses. For Brill–Zinsser disease, doxycycline is also the recommended treatment. A single dose or short course of doxycycline in young children poses only a small risk of teeth staining, but that risk needs to be weighed against high mortality associated with advanced disease ([Box 66.1](#page-2-6)). If an alternative is required, chloramphenicolis usually the recommended treatment.Doxycycline can be used intravenously or intramuscularly in case of clinical severity or if the oral course is impossible. Ciprofloxacin should be avoided; indeed a patient misdiagnosed as having typhoid died from typhus after this treatment, in spite of its in vitro efficiency.

In association with antibiotic treatment, de-lousing is a critical control measure, but quarantine is not necessary. Eradication of lice can be performed with an insecticide (by washing clothing and bedding with soap containing 7% dichlorodiphenyltrichloroethane [DDT]); clothing can also be washed in water hotter than 60°C and then ironed; if the previous measures are not possible, clothes must be removed and left unworn for a week, as lice die 5 days after being deprived of blood. Effective prevention also requires the application of basic hygiene and sanitary conditions. Nevertheless, it must be highlighted that de-lousing is not sufficient for eradication of epidemic typhus, because infected individuals retain *R. prowazekii* for the rest of their lives and can therefore initiate new outbreaks if a bacteremia concomitant to lice infestation occurs.

When dealing with control at a population level, a preferred method is the blowing of insecticidal powder between humans and their underclothes, following World Health Organization (WHO) recommendations. For example, talcum powder can be used with permethrin (0.5%), DDT (10%), or lindane (1%). Application can be performed with any kind of dusting apparatus or by hand; 30 to 50 g of dust per person is usually needed and is blown through neck openings; up the sleeves; from all sides of the loosened waist; and into socks, headwear, and bedding. Usually one treatment is sufficient, but re-treatment may be required if infestation persists[.7](#page-2-7) Doxycycline must be prescribed in any suspected case.

Vaccines against epidemic typhus have existed since 1920. The attenuated strain *R. prowazekii* Madrid E has been used as a vaccine; however, the limited market for a vaccine and the efficacy of antibiotic treatment and other control strategies have limited vaccine development and usage. There is currently no commercially available vaccine for epidemic typhus.

#### **INTRODUCTION**

Murine typhus, also referred to as *endemic typhus,* is an acute zoonotic infection caused by *Rickettsia typhi,* an obligate, intracellular, gram-negative bacterium.[1–3](#page-4-2) Humans are infected by inoculation of infective rats' flea feces into the flea bite site.[1,2,4](#page-4-2) The disease is widely distributed in tropical and sub-tropical areas, particularly in port cities and coastal regions with rodents.[1,4](#page-4-2) The true incidence of this infection is difficult to establish because of the non-specific clinical presentation leading to frequent misdiagnosis[.1,3,4](#page-4-2) Most cases are mild with the death rate being generally low[.1,3](#page-4-2) Reduction of human cases is brought about by the control of rat populations and their ectoparasites.[4](#page-4-3)

#### **EPIDEMIOLOGY**

The primary reservoirs of *R. typhi* are commensal rats, mainly *Rattus rattus* and *R. norvegicus,* but various rodents and other wild and domestic animals have been reported to act as hosts[.5,6](#page-4-4) The main vectors are the rat flea (*Xenopsylla cheopis*) or the cat flea (*Ctenocephalides felis*) but lice (*Pediculus humanus, Polyplax* lice), bloodsucking mites of rats, and ticks are also reported to be capable of transmitting *R. typhi*. [7,8](#page-4-1) *R. typhi* is acquired by fleas while feeding on rickettsemic vertebrate hosts. The organism infects the midgut epithelium of the flea and is shed in the feces, where it is transmitted to humans by the inoculation of *R. typhi*–laden flea feces onto flea bite wounds through scratching or through rubbing mucous membranes[.9,10](#page-4-0) The typical urban cycle of *R. typhi,* which generally occurs in metropolitan areas, involves the urban rats and their fleas. An alternative cycle of transmission, referred to as the *suburban cycle,* involves opossums and cat fleas.[9,11](#page-4-0)

Murine typhus has been reported on every continent (except Antarctica) and is most prevalent in tropical regions of Southeast Asia, Africa, Central and South America, and in southern parts of the United States and Europe.[7](#page-4-1) Sporadic cases are reported in northern countries in travelers who visited endemic areas.[5](#page-4-4) Most of the reported human cases have been associated in sites with large rat populations. There is a seasonal incidence, which appears to be correlated with the abundance of the vector fleas, which is in late summer and early autumn.[11](#page-5-1) Well-established prevalence data are lacking because the disease is rare and usually neglected, yet seroprevalence studies continue to demonstrate the disease in many locations and have implicated murine typhus as the causative agent in increasingly large proportions of patients with febrile illness.[7](#page-4-1)

#### **NATURAL HISTORY, PATHOGENESIS, AND PATHOLOGY**

Rickettsiae over time have undergone considerable evolutionary genome reduction as they have adapted to their intracellular niche resulting in a gain of virulence.[2,5](#page-4-5) Human endothelial cells bordering the small- and medium-sized vessels are the preferred major targets of rickettsiae.[12](#page-5-2) After the entry of the organism through the skin and infection of cutaneous phagocytic cells, the bacteria are likely transported via lymphatic vessels to the draining lymph nodes where they replicate and subsequently enter the bloodstream, disseminate hematogenously, and infect endothelial cells[.10](#page-5-0) *R. typhi* adhere to endothelial cells through outer membrane proteins and enter the cell through induced phagocytosis. The bacteria then disrupt the phagosomal membranes and gain access to host cytosol[.12](#page-5-2) The mechanisms by which rickettsia escape the phagosome and establish a successful intracellular infection are not fully understood.[12](#page-5-2) However, it is well described that the induced endothelial cell activation and dysfunction lead to endothelial injury with increased vascular permeability resulting in manifestations referred to as *rickettsial vasculitis* (rash, interstitial pneumonia, meningoencephalitis, disseminated intravascular coagulation, and multi-organ failure),[2,10,12](#page-4-5) with perivascular infiltration of lymphocytes, macrophages, plasma, and mast cells[.4](#page-4-3)

#### **CLINICAL FEATURES**

Murine typhus is generally considered mild, many cases are undiagnosed, and therefore it is likely vastly under-recognized[.10](#page-5-0) Incubation period varies from 7 to 14 days[.13](#page-5-3) The disease is characterized by the abrupt onset of fever with commonly accompanying headache, myalgia, chills, and malaise[.7,9,14](#page-4-1) Rash, can occur in 50[%9](#page-4-0) and is usually macular or maculopapular with a centrifugal spread over the trunk, seldom noted on palms and soles.[7,9,10,14](#page-4-1) Every organ can be involved, and the clinical spectrum includes symptoms and signs of arthralgia, cough, pneumonitis, nausea/vomiting, anorexia, spleen/liver enlargement, and abdominal pain.[7,9,11,14](#page-4-1) The clinical course can be complicated with pulmonary involvement (interstitial infiltrations and pleural effusions), acute respiratory distress syndrome, central nervous system involvement (confusion, stupor, coma, aseptic meningitis, encephalitis), renal failure, deafness, deep venous thrombosis, disseminated intravascular coagulation, hematophagocytic syndrome, myocarditis, and hypovolemic shock.[1,11,13,14](#page-4-2) Elderly patients and those with glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase deficiency are at higher risk of developing complications[.1,15](#page-4-2) In untreated patients, clinical manifestations last for 7 to 14 days.[16](#page-5-4) The reported case fatality rate is between 0.5% and 4%[.7,9,11](#page-4-1)

#### **PATIENT EVALUATION, DIAGNOSIS, AND DIFFERENTIAL DIAGNOSIS**

The clinical diagnosis relies on clinical suspicion along with the patient's signs and symptoms. History of possible exposure to

infected arthropods, contact with rats or domestic animals, or travel to an endemic area and supporting data from laboratory diagnostic assays confer the diagnosis[.10,13,17](#page-5-0) The main hematologic findings are thrombocytopenia, leukopenia or leukocytosis, anemia, and high erythrocyte sedimentation rate[.7,14,18](#page-4-1) Prominent biochemical abnormalities are elevated aminotransferases, alkaline phosphatase and total bilirubin, hypoproteinemia, hypoalbuminemia, and hyponatremia. Impaired renal function with mild to moderate proteinuria and hematuria may be also present.[14,18](#page-5-7)

The laboratory diagnosis of murine typhus is based on serology, molecular techniques, and cell culture[.19](#page-5-8) Cell culture is not timely and requires technical expertise and specialized facilities and thus is used only in reference laboratories[.7,10](#page-4-1) The current gold standard for diagnosing murine typhus is the indirect immunofluorescence assay (IFA). Seroconversion or a fourfold increase in antibody titer between the acute- and convalescent-phase sera, separated by at least 14 days, is considered to be diagnostic. The major disadvantages of IFA include poor sensitivity during acute infection, which does not allow for timely diagnosis, and antibody crossreaction within rickettsial groups, which prevents establishing a species-specific diagnosis.[2,7,9,13,17](#page-4-5) Other serologic assays include enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay tests (ELISA), indirect immunoperoxidase assay, and Western immunoblot.[17](#page-5-5) The advantage of Western blot and antigen adsorption is identification of rickettsiae at the species level.[19](#page-5-8) If rash is present, rickettsiae can be demonstrated by immunohistochemistry in rash lesion biopsies[.2,7](#page-4-5) Polymerase chain reaction (PCR) targeting various genes[20](#page-5-9) is a significant tool in detecting rickettsiae in blood, skin biopsies, and arthropods, offering the possibility of early diagnosis and also permitting genus and species identification.[11,13](#page-5-1)

The differential diagnosis of murine typhus includes epidemic typhus, Rocky Mountain spotted fever, ehrlichiosis, meningococcemia, measles, typhoid fever, bacterial and viral meningitis, viral hemorrhagic fever, secondary syphilis, leptospirosis, toxic shock syndrome, Kawasaki disease, and malaria.[21](#page-5-10)

#### **PEDIATRIC CONSIDERATIONS**

Main clinical manifestations are fever, rash, chills, perspiration, anorexia, hepatosplenomegaly, and musculoskeletal symptoms.[22,23](#page-5-11) Pulmonary involvement and digestive symptoms seem to be particularly frequent in children.[22,24](#page-5-11) Laboratory findings include leukopenia, high erythrocyte sedimentation rate, and abnormal liver function tests[.23](#page-5-12) The disease has a mild course, with median duration 12 days[,23](#page-5-12) and complications are infrequent.[22,23](#page-5-11)

#### **TREATMENT**

Νo official guidelines for the treatment of murine typhus are available, and the proposed treatment regimens are based on case series and experts' opinions. The principal treatment regimens for murine typhus in adults are illustrated in [Table 67.1.](#page-4-6)

#### **TREATMENT CONSIDERATIONS IN CHILDREN**

Doxycycline is considered to be safe for treatment of children aged <9 years, because the course is usually short, thus limiting the risk of dental staining.[10,17,25](#page-5-0) The dosage is 2.2 mg/kg (maximum 100 mg) twice daily for 3 to 7 days.[10,25](#page-5-0)

Newer-generation macrolides (clarithromycin and azithromycin) are effective in vitro, and their oral bioavailability and safety in children make them an attractive alternative.[2](#page-4-5)

#### **PREVENTION**

Currently, no vaccines exist for murine typhus.[7](#page-4-1) Infection can be effectively prevented through flea and rodent control measures. Flea bite avoidance measures include wearing proper clothing, avoiding infested locations, and using repellents[.7,17](#page-4-1) Prophylactic antibiotic treatment is not well assessed and currently cannot be advocated[.7](#page-4-1)
