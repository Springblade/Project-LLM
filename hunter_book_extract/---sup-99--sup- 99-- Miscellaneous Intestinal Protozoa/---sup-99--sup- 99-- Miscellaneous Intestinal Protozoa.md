# **<sup>99</sup> 99** Miscellaneous Intestinal Protozoa

*Lynne S. Garcia*

#### KEY FEATURES

- • Miscellaneous intestinal protozoa include *Balantidium coli, Dientamoeba fragilis, Entamoeba polecki,* and *Blastocystis* spp*.* and are considered pathogenic and often associated with symptoms.
- • *Dientamoeba fragilis* can be difficult to identify, even on a permanent stained smear; laboratories using skilled microscopists and permanent stained smears often report seeing more *D. fragilis* than *Giardia lamblia* (*intestinalis, duodenalis*).
- • *Blastocystis* spp*.* remains one of the most common organisms (stramenopile) found in human fecal specimens and may be present more often than either *D. fragilis* or *G. lamblia.*
- • As the various sub-types or sub-species of *Blastocystis* look very similar (some of which are pathogenic and some are non-pathogenic), this may explain the ongoing controversy regarding the pathogenicity of "*B. hominis*"—a controversy that may eventually be resolved at the molecular level.
- • *Entamoeba polecki* can often be confused with other organisms in the genus *Entamoeba;* these amebae are probably often misidentified or missed during routine diagnostic testing.
- • Treatment varies by organism.
- • Prevention rests on limiting fecal–oral transmission.

This chapter discusses some of the miscellaneous intestinal amebae, flagellates, and ciliates that parasitize humans [\(Tables 99.1](#page-1-0) and [99.2\)](#page-2-0). Most change their form and function from the active, feeding trophozoites to the resting, more resistant cyst form, which is primarily responsible for transmission. These protozoa are most often transmitted through food, water, or other materials that are contaminated with fecal material; prevalence is often correlated with socio-economic conditions. Most produce non-specific intestinal symptoms; thus diagnosis requires microscopic identification of the organisms. Fecal immunoassays and molecular methods are becoming available for these protozoa; however, their use remains somewhat limited.

The microscopic examination of the stool specimen, normally called the *ova and parasite examination (O&P),* consists of three separate techniques: the direct wet smear (on very soft or liquid fresh stool only), the concentration (wet mount of concentrate sediment is examined), and the permanent stained smear (the most important part of the O&P for the identification of intestinal protozoa). Microscopic identification is based on specific characteristics of the trophozoites and cysts, most of which are best seen in the permanent stained fecal smear.[1,2](#page-4-0) Key characteristics of the trophozoites include the type of motility (not commonly seen), cytoplasm inclusions, and the number and morphology of the nuclei. Distinguishing features of the cysts include the size and shape, number and morphology of the nuclei, type of cytoplasmic inclusions (chromatoidal bars), and the presence and size of vacuoles.

#### **BALANTIDIASIS**

#### **Introduction**

Balantidiasis is an intestinal infection caused by *Balantidium coli,* a pathogenic ciliated protozoan[.2,3](#page-5-0)

#### **Epidemiology**

*B. coli* is widely distributed in domestic pigs, which serve as the main reservoir for human infection. Transmission is fecal–oral (e.g., through contaminated food or water). Human infection occurs worldwide, but has mostly been reported from Southeast Asia, the Western Pacific islands, and rural South America. Pig farmers or abattoir workers are at particular risk. Sporadic reports exist of epidemics in institutionalized groups in developed countries. Transmission from non-human primates and rats may also occur.

#### **Natural History, Pathogenesis, and Pathology**

Cysts can remain viable for weeks in moist feces and contaminated soil. After ingestion, excystation occurs in the bowel, and the trophozoites live in the large intestine, where they remain asymptomatic in the lumen or invade the intestinal mucosa, producing abscesses beneath the surface or ulcers ([Fig. 99.1\)](#page-1-1).

#### **Clinical Features**

Balantidium infection takes three forms: asymptomatic infection; chronic non-bloody diarrhea, often with halitosis; and severe invasive disease with dysentery similar to amebiasis. The diarrhea may persist for weeks to months before the development of dysentery. There may be tremendous fluid loss, with a type of diarrhea similar to that seen in cholera or in some coccidial or microsporidial infections. Rarely, extra-intestinal disease has been reported involving the lung, appendix, liver, peritoneum, and genitourinary tracts, particularly in immunocompromised persons.

#### **Diagnosis**

Wet preparation examinations of fresh and concentrated fecal material (O&P examination) will demonstrate the organisms ([Fig.](#page-1-2) [99.2](#page-1-2)). Organism recognition and identification on a permanent stained smear is difficult; these ciliates are so large that they tend to stain very darkly, thus obscuring any internal morphology.

#### **Treatment**

Treatment generally involves tetracycline, 500 mg four times a day for 10 days, or doxycycline. Metronidazole 750 mg PO tid for 10 days[4](#page-5-1) or iodoquinol, 650 mg, three times a day for 20 days have also been used.

#### *DIENTAMOEBA FRAGILIS*

#### **Introduction**

*Dientamoeba fragilis* is an ameboflagellate closely related to *Histomonas* and *Trichomonas* spp. [\(Fig. 99.3\)](#page-2-1)[.2,5,6](#page-5-0)

### <span id="page-1-1"></span>**Epidemiology**

*D. fragilis* is found worldwide, and past surveys provide incidence rates of 1.4% to 19%. Much higher incidence figures have been reported for mental institution inmates, missionaries, and Native Americans in Arizona. In some laboratories in countries such as Canada and the Netherlands, *D. fragilis* is the most common protozoa found on stool O&P examination. The life cycle and mode of transmission of *D. fragilis* have not been completely clarified, although transmission via helminth eggs such as those of *Ascaris* and *Enterobius* spp. has been postulated. The cyst stage has recently been confirmed.

## **Natural History, Pathogenesis, and Pathology**

*D. fragilis* is assumed to be non-invasive and thus elicit symptoms by epithelial irritation. The significance of two genetically distinct forms of *D. fragilis* may ultimately serve to clarify the issues of virulence and clinical perceptions regarding pathogenicity. In some cases, the organism has been found in the biliary tree.

Organisms in wet preparations may be easier to see; occasionally in stained preparations that are stained too dark, the organisms may resemble large debris.

#### <span id="page-1-2"></span>**Clinical Features**

Although its pathogenic status is still not well defined, *D. fragilis* has been associated with diarrhea and a number of other symptoms, including intermittent diarrhea, abdominal pain, nausea, anorexia, malaise, fatigue, poor weight gain, and unexplained eosinophilia. The most common symptoms in patients infected with this parasite appear to be intermittent diarrhea and fatigue. A number of studies have even incriminated *D. fragilis* as a cause of irritable bowel syndrome and allergic colitis.

#### **Diagnosis**

Diagnosis of *D. fragilis* infections depends on proper stool collection (a minimum of three fecal specimens, one collected every other day) and processing techniques. Although the survival time for this parasite has been reported as 24 to 48 hours, the survival time in terms of morphology is limited, and stool specimens must be examined immediately or preserved in a suitable fixative soon after defecation. It is very important that permanent stained smears of stool material be examined with the oil immersion objective (100 ×, total magnification 1000×). These organisms have been recovered in formed stool; therefore a permanent stained smear must be prepared for every stool sample submitted for a parasite examination (O&P). Organisms seen in direct

wet mounts may appear as refractile, round forms; the nuclear structure cannot be seen without examination of the permanent stained smear. The cyst form is now confirmed; however, in clinical specimens the number of cysts present is quite small. Thus confirmation of this infection still relies on seeing the trophozoite stage[.6](#page-5-2)

#### **Treatment**

Most authorities recommend treatment in individuals with persistent symptoms and *D. fragilis* infection, particularly if *D. fragilis* is the only pathogen found. No clinical trials have been performed to evaluate therapies against *D. fragilis.* Clinical improvement has been

observed in adults receiving tetracycline, diiodohydroxyquinoline, metronidazole, and paromomycin. Treatment options include metronidazole, iodoquinol, tetracycline, and paromomycin.

#### *ENTAMOEBA POLECKI*

#### **Introduction**

*Entamoeba polecki* is an infrequently pathogenic ameba commonly found in the intestines of pigs and monkeys[.2,7,8](#page-5-0)

#### **Epidemiology**

The organism is found worldwide and is highly prevalent in certain areas of the world such as Papua New Guinea. Transmission is likely human to human or from pigs, monkeys, or domestic animals.

#### **Clinical Features**

Although the majority of cases diagnosed with *E. polecki* infection have been asymptomatic, several cases have been documented in which the patients were symptomatic. Symptoms included anorexia, diarrhea, mucoid stools, abdominal pain, malaise, and eosinophilia.

#### **Diagnosis**

Differentiation of this organism from either *Entamoeba histolytica/ E. dispar/E. moshkovskii/E. bangladeshi* or *Entamoeba coli* is rarely accomplished on the basis of a wet preparation examination and is difficult even with the permanent stained smear ([Fig. 99.4](#page-3-0))[.9](#page-5-3) The nuclear morphology of the trophozoite is almost a composite of those of *E. histolytica*/*E. dispar/E. moshkovskii/E. bangladeshi* and *E. coli.* Without some of the cyst stages for comparison, it would be very difficult to identify this organism to the species level on the basis of the trophozoite alone. The cyst normally has only a single nucleus, chromatoidal material like that seen in *E. histolytica,* and, frequently, an inclusion body. This mass tends to be round or oval and is not sharply defined on the edges. The material, which is not glycogen, remains on the permanent stained smear and stains less intensely than nuclear material or chromatoidal bars.

**Fig. 99.4** *Entamoeba polecki.* Uninucleate cyst in stool. Note the prominent inclusion, chromatoidal bars, and single nucleus (morphology of the nucleus is a composite of all the *Entamoeba* genus nuclei).

#### **Treatment**

As for *E. histolytica,* metronidazole 750 mg three times a day for 5 to 10 days has been used to eradicate the organism.

#### *BLASTOCYSTIS* **SPP.**

#### **Introduction**

Recently this organism has been removed from the protozoa and reclassified in a separate group, the Stramenopila, and there are multiple subtypes at the protein or DNA level[.10–12](#page-5-4) Currently, there are approximately 20 subtypes, 9 of which have been found in humans (half of which are pathogenic and half are nonpathogenic), which may partially explain why some patients are asymptomatic and some have clinical symptoms.

#### **Epidemiology**

*Blastocystis* spp. are found worldwide with a prevalence in some studies as high as 58% and generally exceeds that of other organisms; even 15% of stool submitted in the United States for O&P examination may be positive. Fecal–oral transmission is postulated. Studies suggest the existence of numerous zoonotic isolates with frequent animal-to-human and human-to-animal transmission and of a large potential reservoir in animals for infections in humans. The pathogenicity of *Blastocystis* has long been controversial. Several case-control analyses show no increase in prevalence in patients with diarrhea, with high carriage rates in asymptomatic individuals. Many patients infected with *Blastocystis* also carry other pathogens.

#### **Clinical Manifestations**

In some studies, *Blastocystis* has been associated with diarrhea, cramps, nausea, fever, vomiting, and abdominal pain. An association with irritable bowel syndrome and intestinal obstruction has also been reported. In one study of patients with irritable bowel syndrome, there was a set of patients in whom the presence of *B. hominis* did not appear to be incidental.[13](#page-5-5) Possible relationships between *B. hominis* and intestinal obstruction and perhaps even infective arthritis have been suggested. This infection has also been linked with urticaria; in patients with other underlying conditions, the symptoms may be more pronounced.[14,15](#page-5-6)

#### **Diagnosis**

Routine stool examinations are very effective in recovering and identifying *B. hominis,* although the permanent stained smear is the procedure of choice. The examination of wet preparations may not easily reveal the organism; morphology can be difficult to see at the lower magnifications. If the fresh stool is rinsed in water before fixation (for the concentration method), *Blastocystis* organisms, other than the cysts, will be destroyed, thus possibly yielding a false-negative report. The organisms should be quantitated on the report form (i.e., as rare, few, moderate, or many). The classic form that is usually seen in the human stool specimen varies tremendously in size, from 6 to 40 µm, and is characterized by a large central body, which may be involved with carbohydrate and lipid storage (visually appearing like a large vacuole) ([Fig. 99.5](#page-4-1)). The more amebic form is occasionally seen in diarrheal fluid, but may be extremely difficult to recognize. Generally, *Blastocystis* will be identified on the basis of the more typical round form with the central body.

Quantitation of *Blastocystis* in stool (>5 organisms per oil immersion field) has been proposed to inform whether *Blastocystis* is a pathogen, but this also remains controversial and poorly studied. Although enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) and

micronucleus (very difficult to see even in stained preparation)

fluorescent antibody tests have been developed for detection of serum antibody to *B. hominis* infections, this procedure is not widely available.

#### **Treatment**

Routine treatment of asymptomatic *Blastocystis* infection is not recommended. It is reasonable to treat symptomatic *Blastocystis* infection if no other pathogens are found, particularly if repeat stool studies confirm the parasite. Treatment is most commonly attempted with metronidazole at the amebiasis dose of 750 mg tid for 5 to 10 days. Successful treatment with nitazoxanide, iodoquinol, and trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole has also been reported. Parasitologic and clinical cure rates are relatively low at ≈70%.

#### **NON-PATHOGENIC INTESTINAL PROTOZOA**

A number of non-pathogenic amebae and flagellates are often found during the routine O&P stool examination, including *E. coli, Endolimax nana, Iodamoeba bütschlii, Chilomastix mesnili,* and *Pentatrichomonas* (formerly *Trichomonas*) *hominis* ([Table 99.3](#page-4-4)). Although these are non-pathogens, this finding indicates the patient has come in contact with something contaminated with fecal material containing infective cysts. If the patient is symptomatic, it is important to perform additional testing to detect possible pathogens that might also be present.
