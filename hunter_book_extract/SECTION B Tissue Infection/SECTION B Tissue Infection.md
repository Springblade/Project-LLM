#### KEY FEATURES

- • *Toxoplasma gondii* is a common intracellular protozoan parasite with a worldwide distribution.
- • Although *T. gondii* usually causes asymptomatic infections, 10% to 20% of patients with acute infection may develop cervical lymphadenopathy and/or a flu-like illness. The clinical course is usually benign and self-limited, with symptoms usually resolving within a few weeks to months.
- • Atypical strains of *T. gondii* are responsible for a severe infectious syndrome with pulmonary involvement seen in travelers living in or returning from South America, particularly the Amazon area.
- • Ocular *Toxoplasma* infection, an important cause of retinochoroiditis in America, can be the result of congenital infection or infection after birth. In congenital infection, patients are often asymptomatic until the second or third decade of life, when lesions develop in the eye.
- • Congenital toxoplasmosis results from an acute primary infection acquired by the mother during pregnancy. The incidence and severity of congenital toxoplasmosis vary with the trimester during which infection was acquired.
- • Immunodeficient patients often have central nervous system (CNS) disease but may have retinochoroiditis, pneumonitis, or other systemic disease. In patients with AIDS, toxoplasmic encephalitis is the most common cause of intracerebral mass lesions.
- • The diagnosis of *T. gondii* is based on serologic methods in immunocompetent individuals and parasitologic methods in immunocompromised individuals.
- • Treatment is not needed for a healthy person who is not pregnant. Treatment is usually recommended for pregnant women, persons who are immunocompromised, or persons with ocular disease or severe illness.
- • The drug of choice for the treatment of symptomatic toxoplasmosis is pyrimethamine plus a sulfa drug, usually sulfadiazine. Trimethoprim–sulfamethoxazole may be used in many settings and may be preferred because of its wide availability.

#### **INTRODUCTION**

Toxoplasmosis is caused by an intracellular protozoan parasite, *Toxoplasma gondii,* which can infect humans and virtually all warmblooded animals worldwide. *T. gondii* was discovered in 1908 simultaneously by Nicolle and Manceaux in Tunisia and Splendore in Brazil, respectively, and toxoplasmosis became recognized as a human disease in 1939 to 1940[.1](#page-9-0) The complete life cycle of the parasite was described at the end of the 1960s[.2](#page-9-1) Our understanding of this parasitic disease has evolved recently with the availability of new genomic data. Classically, *Toxoplasma* was considered to be benign in immunocompetent persons but potentially severe in immunocompromised patients and for the fetus. Today, we know that the clinical spectrum and severity of disease depend on both the host and the pathogen's genetic background, the immune status of the host, and the host–parasite interaction. Toxoplasmosis is a possible etiology for a severe infectious syndrome in travelers living in or returning from tropical countries.

#### **EPIDEMIOLOGY**

#### **The Parasite and Its Life Cycle**

Human infection is acquired by ingesting food or water contaminated with oocysts shed in the feces of wild and domestic cats, or tissue cysts in uncooked meat ([Fig. 106.1\)](#page-1-0). The oocyst is ovoid, measures 9 × 13 µm, and can remain viable for more than a year in moist soil. After sporulation (ranging from 2 days to 3 weeks, depending on the ambient temperature) takes place, the oocyst is infectious. Millions of initially non-infectious (unsporulated) oocysts are shed in the cat's feces. Although oocysts are usually only shed for 1 to 2 weeks, large numbers may be shed.

Virtually all warm-blooded animals, especially birds and rodents, can be intermediate hosts in nature and become infected after ingesting soil, water, or plant material contaminated with oocysts. Oocysts transform into tachyzoites shortly after ingestion and multiply rapidly during the acute infection. These rapidly dividing (every 5–12 hours) tachyzoites localize in neural and muscle tissue and are responsible for acute illness ([Fig. 106.2](#page-1-1)). They destroy their host cells, enter adjacent cells, and give rise to focal necrosis with a vigorous local inflammatory reaction. Tachyzoites can cause significant cell destruction before effective immunity is acquired. After 3 to 6 weeks, the infection persists with only slowly dividing bradyzoites inside tissue cysts. Neither chemotherapy nor host immunity can affect the parasite once this transformation occurs. The long-lived bradyzoites persist in a viable state inside cysts during the remainder of the host's life without signs of host reaction; they are responsible for latency and reactivation.

Cysts ranging in size from 5 to 50 µm in diameter appear primarily in the brain, the retina, and in skeletal and cardiac muscles ([Fig. 106.3](#page-1-2)). Cysts are usually spherical in the brain but more elongated in cardiac and skeletal muscles. Cats become infected after consuming intermediate hosts harboring tissue cysts and may also become infected directly by ingestion of sporulated oocysts. Animals bred for human consumption and wild game (e.g., venison) may also become infected with tissue cysts after ingestion of sporulated oocysts in the environment. A very specific phenomenon with *T. gondii* is the transmission of infection from one intermediate host to another by carnivorism, without need for passage through a definitive host.

#### **Transmission**

Humans become infected by ingesting tissue cysts when eating raw or undercooked meat (lamb, beef, or pork) of animals harboring tissue cysts and by ingestion of oocysts in soil-contaminated food (raw vegetables) or drinking water—believed to be the major source of infection in tropical areas. Transmission can also occur when changing the litter box of a pet cat, by blood transfusion or organ

transplantation, and transplacentally from mother to fetus, leading to congenital infections.

A transplanted solid organ from a donor seropositive for toxoplasmosis can transmit *T. gondii* to a seronegative recipient. Heart transplant recipients are particularly at risk for this mode of acquisition, and additional cases have been described with other organs (kidney, lung, liver). Although *T. gondii* has been isolated from the peripheral blood of acutely symptomatic patients, transmission by transfusion is rare.

Transplacental infection occurs in approximately 30% of women if they are first infected during pregnancy and thus have no preexisting immunity. The risk of transmission to the fetus is lowest in the time just after conception (<1%) and increases to virtually 100% if the mother is infected just before delivery. Additionally, transplacental transmission during chronic infection has been observed in immunosuppressed women.

Although uncommon, occupational exposure and transmission via needle stick can occur when working with live *Toxoplasma*infected materials in the laboratory.

#### **Distribution and Prevalence**

*Toxoplasma* is distributed worldwide, but the incidence in humans varies widely ([Fig. 106.4\)](#page-2-0)[.3](#page-9-2) Prevalence depends on local eating habits, environmental conditions, and the presence of definitive hosts. Prevalence also increases with age. The overall prevalence in Western Europe is 30% to 50%. In France, the prevalence in pregnant women declined from more than 80% in the 1960s to 54.3% in 1995, 43.8% in 2003, and to 37% in 2010.[4](#page-9-3) In the United States, seroprevalence declined from 14.1% in the 1988 to 1994 National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES), to 9% in the 1999 to 2004 NHANES[.5](#page-9-4) This has been attributed to improved hygiene, new habits of food consumption (e.g., freezing of meat), and better awareness in the general population regarding the risks of consuming undercooked meat.

In developing and tropical countries, prevalence depends on environmental conditions and climate. It is higher in urban than in rural areas, and in humid compared with dry climates. Foci of high prevalence (>80%) exist in Latin America, parts of Eastern/

Central Europe, the Middle East, parts of Southeast Asia, and Africa. A trend toward decreasing seroprevalence has been observed in Africa: in Gabon, the prevalence in Franceville was 56% in 2007 compared with 71% 15 years earlier. Prevalence is generally higher in South America (e.g., 53% in Southern Brazil) or in Africa (e.g., 46% in Tanzania and 40.8% in Lagos, Nigeria) than in India (20.3% in Bangalore) or in the Far East (<10% in Korea or China).

#### **Genetic Diversity of** *Toxoplasma gondii*

Early studies of parasite genotypes revealed a clonal population structure comprising three lineages, named types I, II, and III[.6](#page-9-5) These archetypal lineages were isolated in Europe and North America from humans and domestic animals. Types I and III are common worldwide; type II predominates in Western Europe and the United States but has not been described in South America to date. Further studies performed on strains isolated in other geographic areas[7](#page-9-6) or from wild animals have revealed a greater genetic diversity. There is a relationship between this genetic diversity and the clinical expression of the infection, as shown in South America where several cases of severe toxoplasmosis were described in immunocompetent patients. Recombinant or atypical (unrelated to any of the archetypal lineages) strains were implicated[.8,9](#page-9-7) These recombinant and atypical strains are not well adapted to human hosts, potentially explaining the greater severity of human infection. As more data become available from America and Africa, a new classification is emerging with 11 haplogroups.[10](#page-9-8)

#### **Pathophysiology**

The primary route of infection is via oral ingestion into the gastrointestinal tract and progression through lymphatics to widespread dissemination. Asexual multiplication of the parasite occurs within the intestinal epithelial cells after ingestion of infective cysts. This early infection period is associated with peripheral parasitemia with *T. gondii* tachyzoites circulating freely, or within mononuclear phagocytic cells, until the development of an effective immune response. Differentiation of tachyzoites into bradyzoites

correlates with the onset of protective immunity and begins after a few days. In the setting of T-cell immune deficiency, bradyzoites can reactivate into tachyzoites. The genetic background of the host may influence the risk of reactivation. In HIV-infected patients the risk of reactivated toxoplasmosis varies depending on the host's human leukocyte antigen (HLA) haplotype[.11](#page-9-9) The absence of effective T-cell immunity in the fetus explains the gravity of congenital toxoplasmosis.

#### **CLINICAL MANIFESTATIONS**

Although infection with *T. gondii* in developed countries is asymptomatic in 80% of newly infected patients, there are several distinct clinical syndromes.

#### **Acute Postnatal-Acquired Toxoplasmosis in Immunocompetent Patients**

In the 20% of patients with symptoms at presentation, the disease is generally mild, similar to a mononucleosis or mild influenza-like illness. The incubation period is 1 to 2 weeks. The most frequent symptoms are fever, asthenia, and a single, enlarged cervical lymph node, but regional and generalized lymphadenopathy can occur. The lymph nodes are non-tender and do not suppurate. Macular or urticarial rash, arthralgia, myalgia, and hepatitis are less common findings. Symptoms usually resolve spontaneously within a few weeks or months. Ocular involvement is also possible—more frequently reported in South America (particularly Brazil) —but not specifically associated with recent primary infection or with a wild toxoplasmosis cycle.

There have been fewer than 100 reported cases of severe primary toxoplasmosis caused by an atypical or recombinant strain of *T. gondii* in immunocompetent hosts. The majority of these patients were infected in French Guiana, but cases have also been reported from other areas. In some European cases, the source of infection has been determined to be undercooked horse meat imported from South America[.12](#page-9-10) Clinically, the patient presents with a marked, non-specific infectious syndrome with visceral involvement. Fever higher than 39°C for more than 10 days is prominent. In two-thirds of cases there is weight loss of >5% body weight, generalized lymphadenopathy, elevated liver enzyme levels, and pulmonary involvement. Fifty percent of the patients have severe headache and a third have diarrhea, hepatosplenomegaly, or chorioretinitis. Other reported complications include Guillain–Barré syndrome, pericarditis, myositis, and cutaneous rash. One third of the patients have an acute respiratory distress syndrome, which without treatment can be fatal. Lung involvement generally occurs 10 to 15 days after the onset of fever and may require hospitalization with an associated poorer prognosis. Eleven cases of severe acute primary toxoplasmosis in a village in Surinam were described; all the patients were infected by the same atypical strain. There were five disseminated acute toxoplasmosis cases, with one death; four less severe cases (without hospitalization); and two lethal cases of congenital toxoplasmosis. Different clinical outcomes may be explained by different genetic backgrounds in hosts or by the size or type of parasite inoculum[.13](#page-9-11) It is important to consider the diagnosis of acute toxoplasmosis in patients who live in or have recently traveled to South America—especially the Amazon region—and who present with a severe infectious syndrome with pulmonary involvement.

#### **Toxoplasmosis in Immunocompromised Hosts**

In immunocompromised patients, toxoplasmosis is a severe disease. Most cases are reactivation of chronic infection resulting from impaired T-cell immunity. High-risk groups include HIV-infected patients with a CD4 cell counts <100/mm3

immunosuppressive agents, and bone marrow transplant patients. Such patients, if seronegative, are also at risk for newly acquired infection. Initial diagnosis will often focus on a clinically localized finding, whereas further evaluation will reveal disseminated infection. The most common clinical presentation is multifocal necrotizing encephalitis. Patients present with headache and a focal neurologic deficit; fever appears in 50% of cases.[14](#page-9-12) Other common neurologic presentations include generalized seizures, with or without encephalitis. Although meningeal signs are uncommon, cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) mononuclear pleocytosis and mildly elevated protein are common.

Computed tomography (CT) and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) of the head typically show multiple, low-density lesions at the corticomedullary junction or in the basal ganglia that enhance after administration of intravenous contrast [\(Fig. 106.5\)](#page-3-0).

Another common clinical presentation is pneumonia (which can resemble pneumocystosis), but any organ can be involved because *T. gondii* infects all nucleated cell types. Forty percent of AIDS patients with ocular localization will also have a brain abscess. Disseminated toxoplasmosis usually presents with high and prolonged fever with altered mental status, arthralgia, rash, and focal clinical (central nervous system [CNS] abscess, pneumonia) or laboratory (elevated liver enzymes, hemophagocytosis) findings. There is a higher rate of cerebral involvement in AIDS patients

, patients treated with **Fig. 106.5** MRI of brain of patient with *Toxoplasma* encephalitis.

than in those whose immunosuppression is not HIV related where pulmonary involvement is more frequent. In tropical areas, the rate of *Toxoplasma* reactivation is dependent on the local prevalence of infection in the community.

Although host factors are more important than parasite factors in immunocompromised patients' susceptibility to toxoplasmosis[,15](#page-9-13) the genetic makeup of the particular *T. gondii* strain involved may be associated with atypical presentations. Ghosn et al[.16](#page-9-14) reported one case of inguinal lymphadenopathy in a HIV patient with undetectable viral load and CD4 cell count of >500/mm3 . An atypical *Toxoplasma* strain was isolated from the lymph node, suggesting that this patient was likely infected by *T. gondii* in the West Indies several years before. Severe generalized toxoplasmosis with high fatality rates occurs when recipient-negative persons receive donor-positive organs. Fortunately, prophylaxis with trimethoprim–sulfamethoxazole (TMP-SMX) is effective in preventing post-transplant toxoplasmosis[.17](#page-9-15)

#### **Acute Toxoplasmosis During Pregnancy**

Primary infection of the mother with consequent infection of the placenta is the mechanism for congenital transmission. The placenta allows transmission to the fetus in 30% to 50% of infections acquired in pregnancy. The rate of transplacental infection and severity of disease in the fetus vary with the time of infection in relation to gestation. When maternal infection occurs in the first trimester, the risk of fetal infection is only about 10% but disease is severe. When maternal infection occurs in the third trimester, the risk of fetal infection rises to 65% and approaches 100% at term; however, neonatal infection in these cases is usually asymptomatic.

Suspected or confirmed toxoplasmosis during pregnancy leads to complex and ongoing management challenges[.18](#page-9-16) With appropriate monitoring and treatment of seroconversion, the great majority (70%–80%) of congenital infections are asymptomatic. In settings where such prenatal monitoring is unavailable, congenital infection rates are much higher.

One strategy is to place pregnant women suspected of having toxoplasmosis on spiramycin 1 gm (usually about 3–4 million Units) three times daily to reduce the risk for serious neurologic sequelae while waiting for the results of serologic testing[.19](#page-9-17) If a recent infection with toxoplasmosis is confirmed, an amniocentesis is performed and *Toxoplasma* polymerase chain reaction (PCR) testing of amniotic fluid is done. If the PCR is negative, infection did not occur and spiramycin could be continued through delivery. In resource-limited, lower-income countries, the sophisticated reference laboratories for serologic testing and antenatal diagnostic procedures are not available.

#### **Congenital Toxoplasmosis**

Severe congenital toxoplasmosis presents at birth with intracranial calcifications, hydrocephalus, and chorioretinitis. The diagnosis is more difficult in mild or asymptomatic forms. Sequelae may develop just after delivery or later. Physicians must consider congenital toxoplasmosis when a newborn exhibits ocular abnormalities (chorioretinitis, blindness, strabismus, cataracts, or nystagmus), epilepsy, mental retardation, microcephaly, intracranial calcifications, diarrhea, hypothermia, or anemia. The main determinant of the severity of congenital toxoplasmosis remains the stage of pregnancy at the time of infection. In non-archetypal (i.e., not types I, II, or III) strains, primary infection of the mother does not appear to have any unique consequences for the mother, although the few reported cases have been associated with severe congenital disease in the newborn[.20](#page-9-18) A reported case of re-infection with congenital transmission in a mother who had been exposed to toxoplasmosis before conception suggested that acquired immunity against archetypal strains may not protect against reinfection by atypical strains[.12](#page-9-10) **Fig. 106.6** Active ocular toxoplasmosis.

#### **Ocular Toxoplasmosis**

Ocular toxoplasmosis is the main cause of posterior uveitis worldwide.[21](#page-9-19) The majority of ocular disease in immunocompetent patients is postnatally acquired infection[.22,23](#page-9-20) Ocular involvement is not specifically associated with recent primary infection, but it can be delayed several months (or even years) after primary infection.[24](#page-9-21) In all cases, the main clinical presentation of *Toxoplasma* chorioretinitis is a focally necrotic retinal lesion with fuzzy outlines ([Fig. 106.6](#page-4-0)). It is accompanied by a whitish vitreous exudate that sometimes obscures the lesion.[25](#page-9-22) A new lesion can occasionally arise from the edge of an old one. Chorioretinitis may be associated with edema of the retina and optic nerve, optic neuritis, iridocyclitis, and, in rare instances, panuveitis. In congenital toxoplasmosis, the ocular lesions are more likely bilateral compared with unilateral lesions in postnatally acquired cases. Ocular toxoplasmosis is characterized by recurrent episodes of chorioretinitis that can be associated with severe morbidity if the disease extends to structures critical for vision or if there is a retinal detachment. The timing of recurrences is unpredictable, but the individual risk is estimated to be as high as 50%.

A high prevalence of ocular toxoplasmosis has been reported in South America[26](#page-9-23) and Africa[.27](#page-9-24) In the UK, the risk of ocular toxoplasmosis is 100 times higher in black persons born in West Africa than in subjects born in Britain[.27](#page-9-24) In Brazil, the incidence of ocular toxoplasmosis is 17.7% compared with 0.6% in Alabama (United States). Similarly, in Brazil, the ocular sequelae of congenital toxoplasmosis are more frequent, more recurrent, and more severe than in Europe[.28](#page-9-25) As discussed previously, there is considerable genetic diversity in tropical areas with many atypical strains of *T. gondii* circulating; in Brazil there is no archetypal strain II that predominates in United States. Type II strain in France can be responsible for ocular toxoplasmosis in both immunocompetent and immunocompromised patients.[29](#page-9-26) Cumulatively, these data suggest that some strains probably have a tropism for eye tissues but that there are also host factors involved in the occurrence of ocular toxoplasmosis.

#### **DIAGNOSIS**

#### **Laboratory Diagnosis**

The differential diagnosis of the various syndromes of toxoplasmosis is broad, and laboratory confirmation is recommended in all suspected cases, and is essential in the immunocompromised or in those with severe syndromes. The diagnosis of toxoplasmosis is confirmed by direct detection of parasites in tissue specimens or by serology.

#### **Direct Detection and Identification of the Parasite**

*Toxoplasma* tachyzoites or cysts can be demonstrated on tissue imprints, biologic fluids (blood, bronchoalveolar lavage [BAL], CSF, amniotic fluid), or biopsies (CNS, lymph node, bone marrow) that are fixed and stained appropriately. The diagnosis of acute infection requires the visualization of tachyzoites. The tachyzoites of toxoplasmosis must be distinguished from other intracellular parasites such as *Histoplasma, Leishmania, Sarcocystis,* and *Trypanosoma cruzi.* Isolation of parasites from blood or other body fluids by intraperitoneal inoculation in mice is very useful in isolating the strain. The mice should be tested for the presence of *Toxoplasma* organisms in the peritoneal fluid 6 to 10 days post-inoculation; if no organisms are found, serology can be performed on the animals 4 to 6 weeks post-inoculation. There are no accepted cell culture techniques for diagnosis because of a lack of sensitivity. The detection of *T. gondii* DNA by real-time PCR is the more sensitive method for the diagnosis.[30,31](#page-9-27) Sensitivity using this technique is 95% for antenatal diagnosis in amniotic fluid and for disseminated toxoplasmosis in blood. In localized toxoplasmosis, the sensitivity is similar if PCR is performed on an appropriate sample (BAL, cerebral biopsy) but is less sensitive in blood. In AIDS patients with cerebral abscesses, PCR on CSF is positive in only 30% to 60% of cases.

#### **Serologic Testing**

Serologic diagnosis is the routine method of diagnosis for most patients and is based on the detection of *T. gondii*–specific immunoglobulin (Ig)G and IgM antibodies. The interpretation of *Toxoplasma* antibody tests can be complex [\(Table 106.1\)](#page-5-1). The first serologic methods were developed by Sabin, Feldman (IgG), and Remington (IgM)[.32,33](#page-9-28) The great majority of laboratories use enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) or electrochemiluminescence immunoassay (ECLIA). Agglutination and indirect hemagglutination tests are easy to perform. Results of IgG studies are generally expressed as international units per milliliter (IU/mL), whereas IgM levels are reported as an index or as serial dilutions. The modern gold standard for anti-*Toxoplasma* IgG is Western blot; for IgM it is the immunosorbent agglutination assay (ISAgA).

The determination of the avidity of anti-*Toxoplasma* IgG antibodies by their ability to stay bound to the antigen when exposed to chaotropic salt solutions can be useful to exclude an early infection[.34](#page-9-29) Anti-*Toxoplasma* antibodies formed in the few months after infection are less tightly bound (lower avidity) than antibodies found much later in the infection (higher avidity). Avidity assays may be useful in the differential diagnosis of lymphadenopathy and dating infection in pregnant women[.30](#page-9-27) Many manufacturers provide automated methods for the avidity index calculation. If the avidity index is high, it excludes an acute toxoplasmosis during the previous 3 to 5 months (depending on the reagent). A very low avidity index can be suggestive for an acute toxoplasmosis,[34,35](#page-9-29) but this index can commonly stay low in chronically infected patients[.34,36](#page-9-29) The U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA)–cleared VIDAS TOXO IgG Avidity assay (bioMérieux Inc., Hazelwood, MO) helps determine whether a pregnant woman or a person

#### **Diagnosis of Acute Postnatal-Acquired Toxoplasmosis in Immunocompetent Patients**

Acute infection is assessed by seroconversion from a negative to a positive serology. It is the appearance of IgG that defines seroconversion; the presence of IgM alone can be non-specific or related to cross-reactions. If no negative baseline sample exists, a fourfold rise in IgG titers with dilution methods or a twofold rise with ELISA or ECLIA methods, combined with a positive IgM, drawn at 2- to 3-week intervals and run in parallel is highly suggestive of an acute infection. Modern IgM immunosorbent assays are very sensitive and specific, but the persistence of these IgM antibodies means that their presence is not, by itself, sufficient to diagnose an acute infection. In such cases, a high IgG avidity index may exclude an acute infection. The lack of standardization between assays may lead to discrepant results; no conclusions can be drawn comparing two results obtained from two different laboratories using different reagents. Routine serology tests are sufficient for diagnosis of "Guyanese toxoplasmosis" strains; serologic response to these strains is generally brisk, with very high IgG titers and a long persistence of specific IgM and IgA.

The differential diagnosis of acute toxoplasmosis is broad and includes infectious mononucleosis caused by Epstein–Barr and cytomegaloviruses, acute HIV infection, cat scratch disease, tuberculosis, lymphoma, tularemia, Hodgkin's disease, and sarcoidosis.

#### **Diagnosis of Toxoplasmosis in Immunocompromised Hosts**

Positive serology indicates only that the diagnosis is possible. A negative serology excludes the diagnosis, except in case of primary infection; for these patients, the appearance of an IgM and IgG response can be delayed. The diagnosis is confirmed by demonstration of the parasite in biopsies or biologic fluids by PCR. In the case of cerebral lesions, a therapeutic trial is frequently initiated, with biopsy performed only if there is no clinical improvement after 1 week of treatment. Brain biopsy without a therapeutic trial is indicated in immunocompromised patients with a negative specific IgG serologic test, non-enhancing single lesions, and those on routine prophylaxis with TMP-SMX because these abnormalities are then unlikely to be caused by *Toxoplasma.*

The most common clinical presentation of *T. gondii* infection among patients with AIDS is focal encephalitis with headache, confusion or motor weakness, and fever[.37](#page-9-30) Physical examination might demonstrate focal neurologic abnormalities, and in the absence of treatment, disease progression results in seizures, stupor, and coma.

Retinochoroiditis, pneumonia, and evidence of other multifocal organ system involvement can be observed after dissemination of infection but are rare manifestations in this patient population. A CT scan or MRI of the brain will typically show multiple contrastenhancing lesions, often with associated edema (see [Fig. 106.5](#page-3-0))[.38](#page-10-1) However, toxoplasmosis also can manifest as single lesions in the brain.

The differential diagnosis of CNS toxoplasmosis in immunocompromised individuals mimics other causes of enhancing mass lesions such as lymphoma, metastatic carcinoma, tuberculoma, and brain abscess.

#### **Diagnosis of Congenital Toxoplasmosis**

The gold standard for the antenatal diagnosis of congenital toxoplasmosis is PCR performed on amniotic fluid. If there are no abnormalities on fetal ultrasound, the mother is treated until delivery. If severe abnormalities are detected on ultrasound, medical interruption of the pregnancy might be considered based on the parents' choice and local laws. If an antenatal diagnosis is negative or was not performed, neonatal diagnosis is done via child/mother comparison via the immunoblot method. A positive result of PCR or mouse inoculation for the placenta is not an argument for diagnosis—it is possible to have placentitis without infection of the fetus. After 1 week of life, the presence of anti-*Toxoplasma* IgM, or after 3 weeks of life the presence of IgA in the child's serum, confirms the diagnosis. This presence must be confirmed by ISAgA. IgG passively transferred from mother to child should disappear by 10 to 12 months.

The differential diagnosis of congenital toxoplasmosis includes congenital infections with cytomegalovirus, herpes simplex, rubella, *Listeria,* syphilis, *T. cruzi,* and erythroblastosis fetalis.

#### **Diagnosis of Ocular Toxoplasmosis**

The current gold standard for diagnosis of ocular toxoplasmosis is a thorough ophthalmologic examination. In patients with atypical lesions, laboratory methods may confirm the diagnosis[.39](#page-10-2) The most reliable method is aspiration of aqueous humor that can be tested for specific antibody production or for *T. gondii* DNA by PCR. The ratio of local specific intraocular antibody production compared with serum antibody (Goldmann–Witmer coefficient) is calculated as: (anti-*Toxoplasma* IgG in aqueous humor/total IgG in aqueous humor) / (anti-*Toxoplasma* IgG in serum/total IgG in serum). A value of 2 is considered evidence of intraocular antibodyAb synthesis. Immunoblotting for IgG and IgA can also be utilized.[40](#page-10-3)

The differential diagnosis of ocular toxoplasmosis includes uveitis caused by syphilis, tuberculosis, viruses, toxocariasis, leprosy, and sarcoidosis.

#### **TREATMENT**

Most drugs used for the treatment of toxoplasmosis are active only against the tachyzoite forms of the parasite, and treatment does not eradicate the infection. Atovaquone has limited in vitro activity against the cyst forms. See [Table 106.2](#page-7-0) for treatment details.

Specific treatment is not indicated for a healthy person with mild symptoms who is not pregnant, as they usually resolve within a few weeks. Treatment is usually recommended for severe illness in the immunocompetent host, infection acquired during pregnancy, clinical manifestations compatible with toxoplasmosis in immunosuppressed patients, congenital infection (whether the infant is symptomatic or not), or persons with active ocular disease or severe illness. The treatment of toxoplasmosis in immunocompromised patients is a medical emergency. Primary prophylaxis is used in severely immunosuppressed patients.

Standard therapy for most indications is a combination of oral pyrimethamine and a sulfonamide. A 200-mg loading dose of pyrimethamine given in divided doses is followed by a daily dose of 1 mg/kg in adults and every 1 to 3 days for children. In some cases, additional corticosteroid therapy against local inflammation is necessary, particularly in ocular involvement and in cerebral abscess[.41,42](#page-10-4)

The new gold-standard therapy in tropical countries should be TMP-SMX. For immunocompromised individuals, maintenance therapy is given until effective immune reconstitution occurs. Additionally, primary prophylaxis is necessary for persons with CD4 T-cell depletion of less than 200 cells/mm3 . The regimen is the same for primary or secondary prophylaxis, with one tablet (160 mg trimethoprim/800 mg sulfamethoxazole) daily[.43–46](#page-10-0)

Treatment recommendations in pregnancy vary; in some countries treatment by pyrimethamine–sulfonamide is systematically given in cases of seroconversion after the first trimester of the pregnancy. In other locations, spiramycin is given until the result of amniocentesis is known and pyrimethamine–sulfonamide used only if the antenatal diagnosis is positive. There is also variability in the duration of the pyrimethamine–sulfonamide regimen used (only 1 month or until delivery). Changes in antibody titers are not useful for monitoring responses to therapy.

Patients with *Toxoplasma* encephalitis should be monitored routinely for adverse events and clinical and radiologic improvement. Common pyrimethamine toxicities include rash, nausea, and bone marrow suppression (neutropenia, anemia, and thrombocytopenia) that can often be reversed by increasing the dose of folinic acid (leucovorin) to 50 to 100 mg/day administered in divided doses. Common sulfadiazine toxicities include rash, fever, leukopenia, hepatitis, nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, and crystalluria. Common clindamycin toxicities include fever, rash, nausea, diarrhea (including pseudomembranous colitis or diarrhea related to *Clostridium difficile* toxin), and hepatotoxicity. Common TMP-SMX

toxicities include rash, fever, leukopenia, thrombocytopenia, and hepatotoxicity. Drug interactions between anti-convulsants and antiretroviral agents should be evaluated carefully and doses adjusted according to established guidelines. Several cases of neurologic disease have been attributed to immune reconstitution and toxoplasmosis, but more data are needed to verify that such cases are immune reconstitution syndrome related to *T. gondii*. [41](#page-10-4)

#### **PREVENTION**

Several countries have a policy for the prevention of congenital toxoplasmosis, based on the serologic survey of the mother. In the case of a negative result, in France, serologic testing is repeated every month until delivery with a last sample 2 to 3 weeks postpartum to verify the absence of peripartum infection. Hygienic measures to prevent primary *T. gondii* infection are drawn directly from the knowledge about biologic characteristics of the infective stages of *T. gondii:*

- • Cook meat until well done or stew.
- • Avoid microwave cooking.
- • To eat raw meat safely, freeze it before hand to at least −20°C for at least 3 days.
- • Wash hands, knives, any containers, and the table thoroughly after meat manipulation or cutting of raw meat.
- • Wash hands after gardening or other external activity with contact with soil, and after having close contact with a cat.
- • Wash fruits and vegetables (especially those growing in contact with soil) thoroughly before eating them raw.
- • If there is a cat:
  - • The litter box should be changed every 2 days, preferably by another person, or wear a mask and gloves when changing it.
  - • Keep it inside and feed it only canned or dried commercial food.

The same recommendations must be given to immunocompromised patients seronegative for toxoplasmosis.

#### **CONCLUSION**

Since its recognition as a human pathogen in 1939, understanding of *Toxoplasma* has evolved dramatically. By the end of the 1990s, description of *T. gondii*'s genetic composition has led to a better understanding of its biologic diversity and pathologic variability. We know today that the disease, once considered to be benign, is potentially severe in immunocompetent patients. Acute toxoplasmosis must be considered in the differential diagnosis of a patient living in or returning from tropical areas—particularly the Amazon region of South America—who presents with a severe infectious syndrome with pulmonary involvement[.47](#page-10-7)
