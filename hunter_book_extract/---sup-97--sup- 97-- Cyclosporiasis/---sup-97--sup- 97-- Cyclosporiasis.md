# **<sup>97</sup> 97** Cyclosporiasis

*Bradley A. Connor*

#### KEY FEATURES

- • Cyclosporiasis usually manifests as self-limited diarrhea. Fever and myalgia may be present. Prolonged symptoms may be reported in a subset of individuals.
- • The organism has now been described worldwide. In countries where local transmission has been studied, risk is seasonal.
- • Outbreaks have occurred in developed countries due to ingestion of imported food.
- • Microscopic diagnosis of the oocysts excreted in stool is enhanced by doing a concentration procedure followed by modified acid-fast staining. New DNA extraction polymerase chain reaction (PCR) diagnostics have aided identification.
- • Treatment usually involves trimethoprim–sulfamethoxazole.

## **INTRODUCTION**

Cyclosporiasis is an intestinal infection with the coccidian organism *Cyclospora cayetanensis.* Infection is associated with diarrhea, fatigue, and anorexia. *Cyclospora* was definitively identified in 1993[1](#page-1-0) after being independently discovered by four different researchers dating back to 1979.[2,3](#page-1-1)

#### **EPIDEMIOLOGY**

Since it was first noted in 1979, *Cyclospora* has been identified in an increasing number of countries throughout the world, including Papua New Guinea, Solomon Islands, Vietnam, Indonesia, Malaysia, Thailand, Cambodia, Haiti, the Dominican Republic, Mexico, Puerto Rico, Guatemala, Costa Rica, Cuba, Argentina, Venezuela, the United States, Peru, Nepal, India, Pakistan, Morocco, Egypt, South Africa, Kenya, and Tanzania. Infection is distinctly seasonal in most environments, for reasons that have not been determined. The organism has been known to be transmitted in both food and water. There is evidence that halogens, such as chlorine, may not disinfect *Cyclospora* oocysts in water[.4](#page-1-2) Large outbreaks of cyclosporiasis in the United States in the mid-1990s were traced to Guatemalan raspberries, and later imported fresh salad greens and fresh basil[.5](#page-2-0) A recent review details the epidemiology of *Cyclospora,* summarizes reported food- and water-borne outbreaks, and lists case reports in both returning travelers and those without a travel history[.6,7](#page-2-1)

## **NATURAL HISTORY, PATHOGENESIS, AND PATHOLOGY**

The seasonality of *Cyclospora* is one of its most striking features. In Nepal, the organism is present from May (just before the rainy season) until October (just after the rainy season).[3](#page-1-3) The peak risk is in June and July. In Peru, the *Cyclospora* season extends from January to July, with a peak from April to June. In Guatemala, the main season of risk is May to September. The organism exists in both a sporulated and unsporulated form. Although there are reasons to believe that only the sporulated form is likely to be infectious, human volunteers did not become infected when fed high inoculums of either sporulated or unsporulated oocysts[.8](#page-2-2) The route of infection is presumed to be fecal–oral. However, person-to-person transmission has not been clearly documented, suggesting that there is some necessary but unknown environmental factor. This is most likely the need for sporulation, which takes place in the environment under ideal conditions at 22°C to 32°C after 7 to 15 days. No non-human hosts have been identified, and the life cycle appears to be monoxenous, requiring a single host to complete. Those infected excrete unsporulated oocysts in their feces.[6](#page-2-1)

The organism infects the upper intestine, causing flattening of the villi, crypt hyperplasia, inflammation, and malabsorption[.9](#page-2-3) The complete asexual and sexual life cycle has been identified in cytoplasmic vacuoles in enterocytes located at the tips of intestinal villi on the small intestine of infected humans. *Cyclospora* oocysts are excreted in stool but are not likely to be immediately infectious. Sporozoites have been found intracellularly in extracytoplasmic parasitophorous vacuoles at the luminal surface of the enterocyte in duodenal biopsies. Asymptomatic excretion of *Cyclospora* has not been found among travelers in Nepal but has been reported among children in Peru. Untreated infections last from 2 to 12 weeks, with an average of 6 weeks.[3](#page-1-3)

## **CLINICAL FEATURES**

The incubation period averages 1 week (range 2–14 days). The onset of illness is often abrupt, with severe watery diarrhea, nausea, and vomiting. Abdominal pain, including cramps, epigastric discomfort, and distention, is present in most patients with acute cyclosporiasis. Fever can occur in 30% of cases in the initial 3 days of illness. After 2 to 3 days, the severity of illness decreases and the illness goes into a more chronic phase. Anorexia and fatigue are the two most prominent and consistent symptoms, and patients with a good appetite almost never have cyclosporiasis. The symptoms of anorexia and fatigue are fairly consistent, whereas nausea and diarrhea can come and go. Weight loss almost always occurs in untreated cases. Diarrhea is not prominent late in the disease, in which the hallmark symptoms are profound fatigue and anorexia.

#### **PATIENT EVALUATION, DIAGNOSIS, AND DIFFERENTIAL DIAGNOSIS**

The history of illness should include any foreign travel that may have put the patient at risk for cyclosporiasis. However, sporadic cases occur in the United States without a history of foreign travel due to local acquisition from endemic foci and ingestion of contaminated imported foods. Fatigue and anorexia should be specifically inquired about. A history of sudden onset of moderately severe diarrhea that becomes less severe and more chronic after several days should increase the suspicion of cyclosporiasis. Many patients with *Cyclospora* have already taken an antibiotic, such as ciprofloxacin. Because the initial phase of cyclosporiasis closely resembles a bacterial infection and gets better spontaneously within a few days, it often appears as if the initial course of empiric antibiotics was beneficial, although the patient fails to return to his or her usual state of health. Tests for malabsorption, such as the d-xylose absorption test, although rarely necessary, are abnormal in cyclosporiasis.

The differential diagnosis at the beginning of the illness would include pathogenic enteric bacteria or viruses. However, as the illness progresses, the differential would include other intestinal protozoa, including *Giardia lamblia.* A rare cause of illness in travelers, *Cystoisospora belli,* can also produce prolonged diarrhea after travel, and is sensitive to trimethoprim–sulfamethoxazole. Fatigue and weight loss can be caused by *Entamoeba histolytica,* but anorexia is not as prominent. *Dientamoeba fragilis* can cause prolonged, low-grade intestinal symptoms but without anorexia or weight loss. Fatigue and weight loss can be due to tropical sprue, which is a rare cause of prolonged diarrhea in travelers. Celiac sprue occasionally manifests during foreign travel.

The diagnosis is confirmed by stool examination or polymerase chain reaction (PCR) testing. Although organisms can be detected in unstained stool by an experienced microscopist [\(Fig. 97.1\)](#page-1-4), the organism is most easily detected using a concentration technique such as formalin–ethyl acetate centrifugation and then staining with a modified acid-fast stain ([Fig. 97.2](#page-1-5)). Individuals with acute and severe disease can shed few organisms, so concentration techniques are essential. Concentration of the stool has been shown

to increase the diagnostic yield by over 40%.[10](#page-2-4) Once identified on acid-fast staining, *C. cayetanensis,* which measures 8 to 10 µm, must be distinguished from *Cryptosporidium* spp., which measure only 4 to 5 µm. Ultraviolet fluorescence microscopy can be useful, as *C. cayetanensis* is autofluorescent whereas *Cryptosporidium* spp. are not. *Cyclospora* oocysts stain variably with modified Ziehl– Neelsen acid-fast stain. Some oocysts stain dark red, others stain pale pink, and some do not take up stain at all. Safranin stains oocysts uniformly when the fecal smear and stain are heated by microwave treatment. Other stains used in parasite detection, such as Giemsa and trichrome, do not stain *Cyclospora* oocysts. The organism is consistently shed in the stools of infected patients until the illness ends. *C. cayetanensis* does not cause an inflammatory diarrhea, and fecal leukocytes are not usually seen.

In many places, microscopic diagnosis has been supplanted by multiplex DNA extraction PCR technology; *Cyclospora* is often included as a target organism[.11,12](#page-2-5)

#### **TREATMENT**

Trimethoprim–sulfamethoxazole (TMP-SMX) is the most effective treatment of cyclosporiasis. In a randomized placebo-controlled trial, a dose of sulfamethoxazole 800 mg and trimethoprim 160 mg given twice daily for 7 days was 94% curative[.13](#page-2-6) The few patients who were not cured with 7 days of therapy were cured by a total of 10 days of treatment. In patients who are diagnosed early during the acute phase when diarrhea is prominent, the response to TMP-SMX is fairly rapid, within 1 to 2 days. In later-stage illness, people start to feel better quite rapidly, but because they have usually been ill for a while before treatment, they do not feel better all at once. The recommended adult dose and regimen is sulfamethoxazole 800 mg and trimethoprim 160 mg given twice daily for 7 days. The treatment dose for children is sulfamethoxazole 20 mg/kg and trimethoprim 4 mg/kg every 12 hours for 7 days.

Cyclosporiasis has been described among HIV-positive patients in Haiti. The symptoms were not more severe than in immunocompetent patients. Infection was easily treated with TMP-SMX, but relapse or re-infection was common. A dose of TMP-SMX three times per week prevented subsequent *Cyclospora* infection in HIV-positive patients during 7 months of surveillance[.14](#page-2-7)

In an evaluation of alternative regimens for patients who cannot tolerate sulfa-based treatments, 10 of 11 (90%) HIV-positive patients in Haiti given ciprofloxacin 500 mg twice daily for 7 days were asymptomatic on day 8 and 64% (7 of 11) had negative stool specimens. The standard regimen of TMP-SMX usually eliminates parasites by day 8, even in HIV-infected patients. Anecdotal use of ciprofloxacin in immunocompetent patients with *Cyclospora* in other settings, however, has not been effective. In a case report, nitazoxanide, 500 mg twice daily for 7 days, resulted in improved symptoms and clearing of *Cyclospora* oocysts from the stool in a patient with severe sulfa allergies[.15](#page-2-8) Other reports found no benefit. A wide variety of antimicrobials have been tried against *Cyclospora* without success, including albendazole, trimethoprim (used alone), azithromycin, nalidixic acid, tinidazole, metronidazole, quinacrine, tetracycline, doxycycline, and diloxanide furoate. Thus currently, only ciprofloxacin and nitazoxanide have any published evidence that they might be effective against *Cyclospora* in individuals who cannot take TMP-SMX.
