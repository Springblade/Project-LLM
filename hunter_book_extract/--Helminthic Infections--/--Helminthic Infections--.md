## **Helminthic Infections**

**110**

# General Principles

*David R. Hill*

#### **DEFINITIONS**

*Helminth* is derived from the Greek word *helmins* and means worm. In contrast to unicellular protozoa, the helminths are large, multicellular organisms with complex tissues and organs.

## **CLASSIFICATION**

There are three groups of helminths that parasitize humans: annelids (segmented worms), nematodes (roundworms), and platyhelminthes (flatworms).

#### **Annelida**

Hirudinea (leeches) is the only class of annelids of medical importance.

## **Nematoda**

Members of this phylum are non-segmented roundworms. The word *nematode* is derived from the Greek *nema* for thread and *eidos* for form. They are characterized by longitudinally oriented muscles, are bilaterally symmetric, and have a complete digestive tract; the sexes are usually distinct.

It is useful to divide nematodes into groups according to the body organ of humans in which they reside.

#### Adult Nematodes Residing in the Gut

This group includes *Ascaris lumbricoides, Ancylostoma duodenale, Necator americanus, Trichuris trichiura, Enterobius vermicularis, Strongyloides stercoralis, Capillaria philippinensis,* and *Trichostrongylus orientalis* (Chapters 111–113).

## Adults Nematodes Residing in the Blood, Lymphatic, or Subcutaneous Tissues

This group includes *Wuchereria bancrofti, Brugia malayi, Brugia timori, Loa loa, Onchocerca volvulus, Mansonella ozzardi, Mansonella perstans, Mansonella streptocerca,* and *Dracunculus medinensis* (Chapters 114–117).

## Larval Stages Causing Human Pathologic Conditions in Various Tissues

Those listed here, with the exception of *Trichinella spiralis* (Chapter 119), are non-human parasites that are unable to develop to adults in humans, who are an aberrant host. In general, these nematodes follow the same migration pattern as in their definitive host, except that it is interrupted.

#### Infections Usually Limited to the Skin and Subcutaneous Tissues

Creeping eruption is primarily caused by the dog and cat hookworms [i.e., *Ancylostoma braziliense, Ancylostoma caninum* (Chapter 113)]. Skin penetration by human hookworms and *Strongyloides* (Chapter 113) sometimes causes similar findings.

#### Infections Primarily Involving the Muscles

The larvae of *Trichinella spiralis* can migrate through many tissues, including the heart and brain, before encysting in muscle.

#### Infections Causing a Visceral Larva Migrans Syndrome

The larval stages of the dog and cat ascarids, *Toxocara canis* and *Toxocara cati* (Chapter 120), cause lesions in multiple organs, principally the liver, brain, lungs, and eye. *Angiostrongylus costaricensis* (Chapter 123) and marine ascarids (e.g., the anisakids and eustrongylids) primarily cause abdominal lesions. *Angiostrongylus cantonensis,* the rat lungworm, causes eosinophilic meningitis (Chapter 122). *Gnathostoma spinigerum,* a stomach worm of domestic and wild cats and dogs, can cause a creeping eruption, an abdominopulmonary hypereosinophilia syndrome, and an eosinophilic myeloencephalitis (Chapter 121).

The dog heartworm, *Dirofilaria immitis,* sometimes causes pulmonary nodules in humans after bites from infectious mosquitoes (Chapter 117). Pulmonary hypereosinophilia can be caused by migrating human ascarids, hookworm, and *Strongyloides* larvae and microfilariae of *W. bancrofti* and *B. malayi.*

#### **Platyhelminthes**

Flatworms are usually dorsoventrally flattened, bilaterally symmetric, and have three body layers lacking a body cavity. They include the trematodes (flukes) and cestodes (tapeworms). The word is derived from the Greek *platys,* meaning broad, and *helmins,* meaning worm.

#### Trematoda

These flukes are usually hermaphroditic; a digestive canal is present in adult stages. Trematode eggs are excreted in the stool, urine, or sputum of the definitive host. All flukes require a mollusk as their first intermediate host. The larval stage that escapes from the mollusk may then enter a second intermediate host (fish, crustacean), encyst on vegetation, or penetrate directly into the skin of the definitive host. If the latter does not occur, infection results from the ingestion of insufficiently cooked fish, crustaceans, and vegetation.

The important trematodes of humans belong to the following genera: (1) adults that live in the venous system—*Schistosoma* (Chapter 126); (2) adults that live in the intestines—*Fasciolopsis, Echinostoma, Heterophyes, Gastrodiscoides,* and *Metagonimus* (Chapter 127); (3) adults that live in the biliary system—*Clonorchis, Opisthorchis, Fasciola,* and *Dicrocoelium* (Chapter 128); and (4) adults that live in the bronchi—*Paragonimus* (Chapter 129).

#### Cestoda

This comprises the true tapeworms, which have a head (scolex) and segments (proglottids). Adults are all parasitic, hermaphroditic, and live in the intestinal lumen of vertebrate hosts. Those that can infect humans include *Diphyllobothrium latum* and *D. pacificum, Taenia saginata* and *T. solium, Hymenolepis nana* and *H. diminuta,* and *Dipylidium caninum.* Their invasive larval stages (hydatid, cysticercus, sparganum, coenurus) can be found in the organs and tissues of humans and other intermediate hosts (Chapters 130–136).

#### **ANATOMY AND PHYSIOLOGY**

Helminths are complex multicellular organisms. Those infecting humans range in length from 0.3 mm (e.g., *Toxocara canis* and *A. braziliense* larvae) to 12 m (e.g., adult *Taenia saginata*). They are round (nematodes) or flat (flukes and tapeworms). They all have an outer coating—the cuticle—that is protective and is involved in active transport of water, electrolytes, and other substances.

Almost all helminths are unable to multiply in their host; rather, they have larval forms that are passed into the environment for further development. The reproductive organs make up a large portion of the body cavities. Nematodes are sexually distinct, with separate males and females, whereas trematodes and cestodes can have separate male and female sexes (schistosomes) or male and female reproductive organs in the same worm or proglottid segment (other flukes and the tapeworms). The trematodes reproduce by self-fertilization or by cross-fertilization, and sperm can be transferred between adjacent mature proglottids of the tapeworms.

#### **TRANSMISSION**

Parasitic worms infect humans in almost all regions of the world, but there is an abundance in the tropics of parasite species and infected individuals. Many parasites require warmer temperatures and high humidity for survival and multiplication. Others require particular vertebrate or invertebrate hosts—for example, fish, snails, crustaceans, or insects—for the completion of their life cycles. And intermediate hosts, particularly insect vectors, are more abundant in warm climates.

#### **Oral Transmission**

The distribution of intestinal nematodes whose eggs are passed in human feces is affected by climatic conditions (e.g., rainfall, temperature, and humidity), as well as sanitation. There can be pollution of soil, water supplies, and foods (particularly vegetables), resulting in a high prevalence of fecally transmitted nematodes.

Eating habits account for the transmission of other helminths, such as ingestion of undercooked or raw meat (*T. spiralis, Taenia* species) or fish (anisakid larvae, *D. latum,* and *Clonorchis sinensis* and *Opisthorchis* species) infected with larval stages of the parasite. Other helminthic infections follow ingestion of larvae-contaminated water (*D. medinensis*), raw snails (*Angiostrongylus* species), raw or undercooked crabs (*Paragonimus westermani*), and aquatic plants (*Fasciola hepatica* and *Fasciolopsis buski*).

People are infected with *Toxocara canis* and *Echinococcus granulosus* after ingesting substances contaminated with dog feces containing the helminth eggs.

#### **Transmission by Skin Penetration**

Larval stages of hookworm and *S. stercoralis* in the soil cause infection when they penetrate intact skin. The larvae of dog and cat hookworms can penetrate unbroken skin but cannot develop fully in humans—they cause a creeping eruption. Cercariae of *Schistosoma* species penetrate the skin of those exposed to contaminated freshwater. *Schistosoma* species not capable of developing in humans cause a rash called *swimmer's itch.*

#### **Transmission by Bite of a Vector**

The filarial parasites develop within the biologic vector, which is also an intermediate host. These can be mosquitoes (*W. bancrofti* or *B. malaya*), black flies (*O. volvulus*), or *Chrysops* flies (*Loa loa*).

#### **MAGNITUDE OF THE HEALTH PROBLEM**

#### **Tropics and Subtropics**

Because many people are infected with more than one species of helminth, there are more different species of helminths infecting people than there are people in the world. The numbers infected with hookworms, *Ascaris, Trichuris,* pinworm, schistosomes, Onchocerca, and filariae are each in the many millions, although they have often been "neglected" in tropical disease control priorities[.1](#page-1-0) A common trinity of intestinal helminthiasis, termed the *soil-transmitted helminths,* includes ascariasis, hookworm infection, and trichuriasis.[2](#page-1-1)

The magnitude of disease caused by helminths is related to the intensity of infection. Individuals with light infections typically have few or no abnormal findings, whereas those with heavy and prolonged infections often have clinical symptoms and signs and can develop complications. This is well documented in schistosomiasis, hookworm disease, onchocerciasis, and filariasis.

#### **Temperate Climates**

Before the middle of the 20th century, the helminthiases were a significant cause of morbidity in the United States. Infections with the intestinal nematodes were particularly common in the Southeast. However, improvements in sanitation have decreased the incidence, except cosmopolitan parasites such as pinworm.

#### **Migrants and Travelers**

Helminths can be found in migrants to high-income countries and in those who have lived for prolonged periods in tropical regions (Chapters 152, 155 and 156). The usual intestinal nematodes, as well as the liver flukes (*C. sinensis* and *Opisthorchis viverrini*), the lung fluke *(P. westermani)*, and *Schistosoma mekongi* and *Schistosoma japonicum,* are sometimes found in migrants from Southeast Asia. Those from Mexico and Central America may have intestinal nematodes. Epilepsy caused by cerebral cysticercosis is seen in migrants from Latin America. Migrants from Africa can have intestinal nematodes, *S. mansoni* and *S. haematobium, T. saginata, W. bancrofti,* and *O. volvulus.*

#### **CHEMOTHERAPY**

Treatment of helminths involves mass drug treatment of populations and treatment of individuals. Mass drug treatment can be given to decrease the burden of infection and disease in a population, for example, ivermectin treatment of filarial infections in Africa or albendazole for soil-transmitted helminths.[3](#page-1-2) Treatment of an individual has the aim of decreasing the intensity of worm infection or curing infection. Therapy of specific helminths is covered in subsequent chapters.
