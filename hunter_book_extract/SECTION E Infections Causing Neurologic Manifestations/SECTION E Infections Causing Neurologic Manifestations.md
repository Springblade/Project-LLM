# KEY FEATURES

- • Bacterial meningitis is a medical emergency. Prompt administration of parenteral antibiotics saves lives.
- • Symptoms of bacterial meningitis may be non-specific, especially in infants and young children.
- • Bacterial meningitis may be caused by hematogenous seeding or spread from contiguous sites (otitis, sinusitis).
- • The gold standard for the diagnosis of bacterial meningitis is lumbar puncture with Gram stain and culture.
- • Common causative agents include *Streptococcus pneumoniae, Haemophilus influenzae,* and *Neisseria meningitidis.* Causative agents in neonates include group B streptococci and gram-negative organisms. *Listeria monocytogenes* can cause meningoencephalitis, usually in immunocompromised, elderly, and pregnant individuals.
- • In patients with HIV infection, acute bacterial meningitis may present with similar clinical features to that of cryptococcal meningitis and tuberculous meningitis (i.e., a more indolent presentation).
- • Adjunctive dexamethasone appears to be of no benefit in low-income countries.
- • Treatment of bacterial meningitis should target the (likely) causative agent(s), but in resource-limited settings usually involves the use of a third-generation cephalosporin such as ceftriaxone. In non–resourcelimited settings, ampicillin should also be administered to individuals at risk of listeriosis, and vancomycin should be added in areas with ceftriaxone-resistant pneumococci. Neonates in non–resource-limited settings are usually treated with ampicillin and gentamicin, ceftriaxone, or cefotaxime.
- • Many of the causative agents of bacterial meningitis are preventable by currently available vaccines, but use of these vaccines is not universal in resource-limited settings.

# **INTRODUCTION**

Acute bacterial meningitis is defined as inflammation of the meninges secondary to bacterial infection. Infection of the meninges arises secondary to colonization of the nasopharynx followed by mucosal invasion, bacteremic spread, and finally crossing the blood–brain barrier into the subarachnoid space. The highest burden of disease from bacterial meningitis exists in tropical and resource-limited areas, where the infrequent use of vaccines targeting the common causative agents of acute bacterial meningitis, coupled with the HIV/AIDS pandemic, has amplified the problem. Bacterial meningitis is usually fatal without treatment. Therefore prompt and accurate diagnosis, coupled with the timely administration of parenteral antibiotics, is necessary in order to save lives[.1](#page-5-0) The presenting clinical features of bacterial meningitis may be similar to those of other central nervous system (CNS) infections, such as tuberculous meningitis, cryptococcal meningitis, and viral meningitis. Historically, most reports of bacterial meningitis in sub-Saharan Africa describe epidemics of meningococcal meningitis caused by serogroup A, occurring approximately every decade. More recently, other serogroups, such as W, have been reported in Africa, although serogroup A continues to predominate.[2](#page-5-1)

# **EPIDEMIOLOGY**

The annual incidence of acute bacterial meningitis is 4 to 6 per 100,000 in high-income countries and 10-fold higher in developing countries. There is a high case fatality rate in developing countries (10%–50%) that is augmented by pre-existing comorbidities (e.g., malnutrition, HIV infection, and sickle cell disease); late presentation to health services; emerging antibiotic resistance; and lack of appropriate antibiotics, medical expertise, and the use of conjugate vaccines against the main three pathogens: *Streptococcus pneumoniae, Haemophilus influenzae,* and *Neisseria meningitidis.* HIV-exposed but uninfected infants are at increased risk of invasive pneumococcal disease (IPD; including pneumococcal meningitis) than HIV-unexposed and uninfected infants. This is a growing population of susceptible infants in the era of antiretroviral therapy in sub-Saharan Africa.[3](#page-5-2)

*N. meningitidis*–associated meningitis occurs across the globe, but *N. meningitidis* can also cause large outbreaks, especially in crowded conditions and in the "meningitis belt" of Africa [\(Fig.](#page-1-0) [58.1\)](#page-1-0), where epidemics occur every 5 to 15 years in the Harmattan season (dry and dusty with a strong wind between November and March) and are associated with up to 10% mortality.[4](#page-5-3)

Although outbreaks of meningitis due to *N. meningitidis* are known to occur, there have also been reported outbreaks of pneumococcal meningitis,[5,6](#page-5-4) including a recent outbreak in older children and adults in Ghana outside the meningitis belt after pneumococcal conjugate vaccine (PCV) introduction in infants.[7](#page-5-5)

The peak incidence for *S. pneumoniae* and *H. influenza*e (Hib) meningitis occurs in children. Hib meningitis is rare over the age of 5 years, but pneumococcal and meningococcal meningitis can occur in all age groups[.4](#page-5-3)

In studies from sub-Saharan Africa in the Hib vaccine era, the most common organisms in children under 5 years of age were *S. pneumoniae,* non-typhoidal salmonellae, and Hib.[8,9](#page-5-6) In older children and adults, *S. pneumoniae* was the most common pathogen. In Southeast Asia, *S. suis* is a frequent cause of acute bacterial meningitis in adults. In HIV-endemic regions, cryptococcal, tuberculous and pneumococcal meningitis are among the leading causes of meningitis in adults.

# **NATURAL HISTORY, PATHOGENESIS, AND PATHOLOGY**

The most common bacteria causing acute bacterial meningitis (*S. pneumoniae, N. meningitidis,* and *H. influenza*e) have neurotrophic potential, which allows them to invade the host mucosal epithelium,

![](_page_1_Figure_2.jpeg)

multiply in the bloodstream, and cross the blood-brain barrier into the cerebrospinal fluid (CSF). The bacteria colonize the nasopharyngeal epithelium by adhering to the epithelial lining of the respiratory tract—the mechanisms of which vary depending on the organism. N. meningitidis and other gram-negative bacteria adhere via pili; S. pneumoniae binds by pneumococcal surfaceassociated proteins, such as pneumococcal surface adhesion A (PsaA) or choline-binding protein A (CbpA). Young children mount inadequate immune responses to bacterial capsular polysaccharides, rendering them particularly vulnerable to these infections. 11 Bacteria cross the blood-brain barrier by a number of processes that include (1) disruption of the tight junctions; (2) transcellular migration by transcytosis; and (3) surviving within phagocytes using a "Trojan horse" mechanism, as well as specific bacteria-host interactions involving cell signal transduction pathways with effects on actin cytoskeleton rearrangements.<sup>12</sup> Survival within the bloodstream depends on the bacteria avoiding host defense mechanisms, particularly complement-dependent killing. N. meningitidis and S. pneumoniae both recruit complement factor H, the main regulator of the alternative complement pathway that controls early activation of the complement cascade. N. meningitidis produces factor H binding protein, and the S. pneumoniae proteins CbpA and pneumococcal surface protein C (PspC) bind complement factor H.

There appear to be two prerequisites for pathogens to cause bacterial meningitis: a high and/or sustained level of bacteremia and an ability to interact with cellular components of the blood-CNS barriers.<sup>13</sup> Longer duration of bacteremia and young age (which itself is inversely related to bacterial load) increase the likelihood of meningeal invasion. If bacteria cross the blood-CNS barrier at the choroid plexus, then they interact with the choroid ependymal monolayer. If they cross at the blood-brain barrier, then the bacteria must adhere to brain endothelium. 13 High CSF pneumococcal bacterial loads are associated with a worse outcome in children but not adults.14,

Once within the CSF, bacteria enter a sanctuary site with relatively low concentrations of complement and antibody. Bacteria and bacterial products (resulting from autolysis) stimulate an inflammatory response of pro- and anti-inflammatory cytokines. In turn, the pro-inflammatory cells stimulate the release of chemokines. Neuronal cell death occurs via a mixture of apoptosis and necrosis. White matter injury also occurs, secondary to small-vessel vasculitis, focal ischemia, or venous thrombosis. The process is summarized in Fig. 58.2.

#### CLINICAL FEATURES

In infants and young children, clinical features are very non-specific and include fever, lethargy, irritability, poor feeding, seizures, respiratory distress, vomiting and diarrhea, and a bulging fontanelle, <sup>16,17</sup> and older children and adults have headache (80%–95%), photophobia (30%–50%), neck stiffness (50%–90%), lethargy, confusion, and positive Kernig's sign (resistance to knee extension upon passive hip flexion; 5%) and Brudzinski's sign (hip flexion upon passive neck flexion; 5%).<sup>1,17</sup> Adults with acute bacterial meningitis usually present with features of fever, neck stiffness, and altered mental status. Van de Beek and colleagues proposed that this triad should be a quartet of fever, neck stiffness, headache, and altered mental status. Two out of four of these features are present in 95% of adults with acute bacterial meningitis. 18 More advanced disease may include opisthotonus, focal neurologic deficit (20%–30%), seizures (15%–30%), and a reduced level of consciousness (Fig. 58.3).

A rash may be present in 10% to 15% of cases of acute bacterial meningitis—most commonly this is the purpuric rash of meningococcal meningitis with septicemia, but a purpuric rash may also be caused by other pathogens. Shock and disseminated intravascular coagulation occur in meningococcemia. Cushing's triad of systemic hypertension, bradycardia, and respiratory depression occurs late and indicates raised intracranial pressure and shift of brain compartments.<sup>17</sup> HIV-positive children with acute bacterial meningitis are more likely to present in extremis and have pneumococcal meningitis, seizures, or a focus of infection, such as otitis media. They take longer to defervesce and are more likely to die or experience recurrence.

Patients should be monitored closely for dehydration, shock, seizures, altered consciousness level, or rising intracranial pressure. Cerebrovascular events, such as infarction and/or edema, obstructive

Immune complex–mediated arthritis occurs late in Hib or meningococcal illness. Neurologic sequelae, such as deafness, cognitive impairment, and developmental delay, occur in 5% to 40% of survivors.<sup>17</sup>

# PATIENT EVALUATION, DIAGNOSIS, AND DIFFERENTIAL DIAGNOSIS

#### **Patient Evaluation**

Initial evaluation should include a thorough history to elicit information on duration of illness, history of seizures, antiretroviral or anti-tuberculous treatment, HIV status, and previous antibiotics or

anti-malarials. Examination should include assessment of nutritional status, presence of a rash, examination of the fontanelle, and eliciting neck stiffness. In the tropics, features of acute bacterial meningitis often overlap with those of severe malaria or cerebral malaria, leading to difficulties in the early recognition of acute bacterial meningitis in children. Several predictor algorithms to assist in establishing the diagnosis of acute bacterial meningitis have been derived, most of which include laboratory data. Only two of these have been evaluated in resource-poor settings. In children, Berkley et al. reported that the presence of one or more of the following is an indication for lumbar puncture<sup>19</sup>: bulging fontanelle, neck stiffness, cyanosis, impaired consciousness, partial seizures, and seizures outside the febrile convulsions age range. Thwaites et al. described a weighted diagnostic score to distinguish acute bacterial meningitis from tuberculous meningitis in adults, which included age, white blood cell count, duration of history of illness, CSF white cell count, and CSF percentage neutrophils.<sup>20</sup> In areas with a high incidence of HIV infection, S. pneumoniae is the most common cause of acute bacterial meningitis; however, tuberculous meningitis and cryptococcal meningitis are also commonly associated with HIV infection—the presenting clinical features of all three diseases are very similar. A clinical algorithm for the management of CNS infections in adults has been described for use in resource-poor settings with a high prevalence of HIV; it demonstrated reduced time to diagnosis and treatment of cryptococcal meningitis.<sup>21</sup>

#### Diagnosis

Lumbar puncture (LP) is the key investigation. LP enables rapid confirmation of meningitis and type of infecting organism. Diagnostic yield of LP can be diminished, particularly for *Mycobacterium*, by collecting small CSF volumes.<sup>22,23</sup>

CSF cell count can be a rapidly informative test. Pleocytosis indicates meningeal inflammation, of which infection is the most common cause. Van de Beek and colleagues reported that >90% of adults with bacterial meningitis had a CSF leukocyte count >100 cells/µL.<sup>24</sup> Absence of pleocytosis makes meningitis less likely,

but does not completely rule it out. Positive pathogen detection with an absent pleocytosis more frequently occurs among children, those who are immunocompromised, and those pre-treated with antibiotics or with mycobacteria TB infection.[25](#page-5-20)

CSF leukocyte differential can guide which type of pathogen is causing infection. Neutrophil predominance suggests bacterial infection, whereas lymphocyte predominance suggests viral. However, there are several exceptions to this. For example, antibiotic pre-treatment can result in a lymphocytic-predominant CSF. In contrast, early viral infection can be associated with neutrophilpredominant CSF.

In terms of CSF biochemistry, CSF glucose is normally around two-thirds the plasma concentration. CSF glucose tends to be lower during infection. A CSF:blood glucose ratio <0.36 is an accurate marker for distinguishing bacterial from viral meningitis.[26](#page-5-21)

CSF protein is normally <0.4 g/L. Elevated protein suggests infection. In one study, a CSF protein <0.6 g/L effectively ruled out bacterial infection.[26](#page-5-21)

CSF parameters have been successfully combined into tools to guide diagnosis of bacterial meningitis. One prediction tool accurately distinguished bacterial from viral meningitis in two adult patient populations, based on retrospective data (area under the curve 0.97)[.27,28](#page-6-0) Clinical prediction tools (including CSF, laboratory, and clinical features) also exhibit high accuracy when tested retrospectively in child populations.[29](#page-6-1)

# Pathogen Detection

CSF microscopy with Gram stain (or an acid-fast stain for *Mycobacterium tuberculosis*) can rapidly detect bacteria. It has a sensitivity between 50% and 99%.[24](#page-5-19) Detection of *Mycobacterium* is enhanced by collection of 10 mL or more of CSF and subsequent cytospin[.22](#page-5-18)

CSF culture is regarded as the "gold standard" for bacterial meningitis diagnosis. It is diagnostic in 70% to 85% of cases before antibiotic exposure. Sensitivity falls by 20% after antibiotic pre-treatment. CSF sterilization can occur within 2 to 4 hours of antibiotic administration for meningococci and pneumococci, respectively[.28](#page-6-2) LP should be performed as soon as possible to optimize pathogen detection.

CSF polymerase chain reaction (PCR), using pathogen-specific nucleic acid sequences, can detect bacteria with high sensitivity. PCR is increasingly relied upon in bacterial meningitis. It has far greater sensitivity than culture in invasive meningococcal disease[.30](#page-6-3) CSF PCR is particularly valuable in patients who receive antibiotics before LP. PCR for 16S ribosomal RNA (present in almost all bacteria) enables a broad screen for bacteria, but has lower sensitivity than pathogen-specific PCR.[26,28](#page-5-21)

Blood cultures are positive in 50% to 80% of bacterial meningitis cases[.28](#page-6-2) Blood cultures can be useful when antibiotics are started before LP. Blood PCR is increasingly important, especially as PCR detects bacteria several days after antibiotic initiation.[30](#page-6-3) Blood PCR increases the confirmation in meningococcal disease[.31](#page-6-4)

Blood biomarkers, such as procalcitonin and C-reactive protein, have been reported to accurately distinguish bacterial from viral meningitis in adults[.32,33](#page-6-5)

Latex agglutination tests are simple and rapid to perform, but their cost is still prohibitive for resource-limited settings and refrigeration is required for the kits. Studies have shown that they do not add much to the microbiologic diagnosis of acute bacterial meningitis in areas with microbiologic capability. In contrast, the sensitivity and specificity of cryptococcal latex agglutination tests are high, and this may help to rapidly differentiate between bacterial and cryptococcal etiology in areas of high HIV incidence. A duplex rapid diagnostic test for *N. meningitidis* has been evaluated on CSF samples from Niger and reported very good sensitivities and specificities for serogroup A and serogroup W.[34](#page-6-6)

# Brain Imaging

An urgent computed tomography scan should be performed if there are clinical signs of raised intracranial pressure. Clinical features indicative of raised intracranial pressure include focal neurologic signs, papilledema, uncontrolled seizures, and reduced Glasgow Coma Scale (GCS) scores[.26](#page-5-21) Patients with a GCS ≤12 should be considered for critical care, intubation assessment, and neuroimaging. Imaging, particularly when contrast is used, may exhibit meningeal enhancement. Unnecessarily performing neuroimaging before LP is associated with delays in commencing antibiotics, which in turn can lead to increased mortality[.23,35](#page-5-22)

# **TREATMENT**

If a patient exhibits signs of airway, breathing, or circulatory difficulties (e.g., in co-existing sepsis), management should initially focus on stabilization of these systems. In the UK, the Royal College of Physicians recommends consultant review for all acute medical patients within 14 hours of admission. Urgency of review should be assessed using the National Early Warning Score. The GCS should be recorded for its prognostic value and to enable changes to be monitored. Presence of a rash and use of preadmission antibiotics should also be recorded[.26](#page-5-21)

Based on significant benefit in surgical patients, Rivers and colleagues showed that the early (within 6 hours) systematic application of goal-directed therapies (GDT) to stabilize adult patients with sepsis significantly improved mortality[.36,37](#page-6-7) Two important aspects of a GDT protocol include early initiation of the therapeutic measures, together with specific (hemodynamic) targets. In 2014 a meta-analysis of 13 trials in sepsis patients again concluded early GDT improved mortality[.38](#page-6-8) However, one of the largest single randomized controlled trials (RCTs) of GDT, the ProCESS (Protocolized Care for Early Septic Shock) trial, published in 2014, did not show any difference in mortality, in contrast to many earlier studies[.39](#page-6-9) It has been proposed the lack of impact of GDT in the ProCESS trial may have been due to acceptance of the principal interventions and the subsequent Surviving Sepsis Campaign guidelines. This was illustrated by the fact that in the ProCESS trial, all groups received, on average, more than 2 L of fluid before randomization and more than 75% of patients received antibiotics before randomization. In addition, mortality rate was much lower in the ProCESS trial than in preceding trials.

Comparable RCTs of GDT in critically ill patients in resourcepoor settings are desperately needed. A study by Maitland and colleagues showed no benefit of IV fluid resuscitation in children severely ill with malaria[.40](#page-6-10) Recently a longitudinal pre- and postinterventional study by Wall and colleagues among Malawian adults with acute bacterial meningitis again showed no benefit of GDT on mortality.[41](#page-6-11) The evidence, therefore, from resource-poor settings is that aggressive fluid resuscitation in individuals with suspected sepsis, with or without meningitis, is likely to be detrimental.

# **Antibiotics**

Beyond stabilization and supportive management, antibiotics are the cornerstone of acute bacterial meningitis treatment. Untreated, acute bacterial meningitis is almost always fatal; early treatment improves clinical outcome[.17](#page-5-14) When acute bacterial meningitis is suspected, high-dose empirical intravenous antibiotic treatment based on the likely organisms for the patient's age and susceptibility patterns of that region should be commenced without delay ([Table 58.1](#page-4-0))[.1,17](#page-5-0)

Ceftriaxone is recommended by the World Health Organization (WHO) as first-line therapy[.1](#page-5-0) Intravenous and intramuscular administration routes are equally effective, as is once-daily dosing[.1](#page-5-0) However, chloramphenicol (in oily suspension) remains the first choice for treatment in many low-income settings as it is cheap

and readily available. It is contraindicated in infants under 2 months of age.[17](#page-5-14) The WHO recommends a single intramuscular injection of ceftriaxone or oily chloramphenicol to treat epidemic meningococcal meningitis[,4,42](#page-5-3) although longer courses are advised if the child has fever, seizures, or coma after the first 24 hours of treatment.[1,4,42](#page-5-0) Single dosing is reasonably safe during epidemics, as 95% of cases are expected to be caused by meningococcus, which responds well to this treatment; however, a single dose is absolutely contraindicated in non-epidemic situations or for babies under 2 months of age, where the risk of partial treatment of pneumococcal, Hib, or group B streptococcal meningitis is high.[4](#page-5-3) In all categories, the WHO recommends regular clinical reassessment and referral if there is no improvement after 48 hours, or coma or repeated seizures[.4](#page-5-3) An RCT compared 4- and 7-day ceftriaxone treatment courses in Chilean children and showed rapid initial recovery in both groups (the most common pathogens in this study were Hib and meningococcus)[.43](#page-6-12) A large multi-country, double-blind, placebo-controlled, randomized equivalence study of 5 versus 10 days of treatment with ceftriaxone in 1004 children concluded that in children beyond the neonatal age group with purulent meningitis caused by *S. pneumoniae, H. influenzae* type b, or *N. meningitidis* who are stable by day 5 of ceftriaxone treatment, there was no difference in relapse or bacteriologic failure rates between the two groups.[44](#page-6-13)

High rates of Hib and pneumococcal chloramphenicol resistance occur in Africa (10%–13%) and Southeast Asia[.3,16](#page-5-2) Pneumococcal resistance to cephalosporins is a growing global concern; as many as 41% of isolates worldwide (5% in Africa) demonstrate cephalosporin and penicillin resistance,[1,4,45](#page-5-0) necessitating the addition of vancomycin or rifampin.[46](#page-6-14)

In non–resource-limited settings, ampicillin should also be administered to individuals at risk of listeriosis; neonates in non–resource-limited settings are usually treated with ampicillin and gentamicin, ceftriaxone, or cefotaxime. In epidemics, empiric treatment usually involves ceftriaxone in any age group and irrelevant of pregnancy status, or oily chloramphenicol in children over 2 years of age and non-pregnant adults.[4](#page-5-3)

# **Adjuvant Therapies**

Dexamethasone use among patients with meningitis has been associated with decreases in complications of hearing loss, neurologic sequelae, and mortality. A Cochrane review in 2007 of 18 RCTs examining dexamethasone versus placebo among Hib and pneumococcal meningitis patients, predominantly from studies undertaken in high-income settings, reported an overall decrease in complications of hearing loss, neurologic sequelae, and mortality. However, sub-analysis showed the decrease in mortality and neurologic sequelae was only observed in adults. Further subanalyses showed the decrease in hearing loss in children was only observed in studies undertaken in high-income settings[.47](#page-6-15) A repeat Cochrane review in 2015, of 25 studies, again showed dexamethasone use was associated with significant decrease in complications of hearing loss and neurologic sequelae, as well as a trend for reduced mortality among adult patients with Hib and pneumococcal meningitis in high-income settings. It also showed a trend for reduced mortality among adult patients with meningococcal meningitis in high-income settings. In children, dexamethasone use was associated with significant decrease in hearing loss among those with Hib meningitis in high-income settings. Dexamethasone was not shown to have any benefit among patients in studies undertaken in resource-poor settings.[48](#page-6-16) Similarly, a meta-analysis of individual patient data from five trials, predominantly from resource-poor settings (Vietnam, South America, Malawi [*n* = 2] and Europe [*n* = 1]), concluded dexamethasone appeared to reduce hearing loss among survivors, but when all patients were analyzed, there was no overall improvement in hearing loss, neurologic sequelae, or mortality associated with dexamethasone use.[49](#page-6-17) Several potential reasons have been suggested as to why dexamethasone shows limited impact in resource-poor settings compared with resource-rich settings; these include later presentation for clinical care, higher pre-hospital antibiotic use, higher HIV rates, and malnutrition among the former patients[.16](#page-5-12)

Osmotic agents have been shown to reduce cerebral edema and improve brain perfusion. Glycerol (1,2,3-propanetriol) is the only osmotic agent that has been assessed in an RCT among meningitis patients. Glycerol is attractive to the low-income setting, as it is cheap, easily available, and administered orally[.17,43](#page-5-14) Although one study suggested that oral glycerol therapy prevented severe neurologic sequelae in childhood bacterial meningitis,[43](#page-6-12) other studies, including meta-analyses, showed no significant benefit over dexamethasone.[44,45,50](#page-6-13)

In suspected bacterial meningitis in high-income settings, dexamethasone should be started either shortly before or simultaneously with antibiotics. Up until 12 hours after antibiotic initiation, dexamethasone can still be started, although the impact of this on mortality has not been studied. If pneumococcal meningitis is probable, dexamethasone should continue for 4 days[.26](#page-5-21) In suspected tuberculous meningitis, dexamethasone provision should follow the recommended guidelines[.22](#page-5-18) Once another cause of meningitis is identified, dexamethasone should be stopped.

Routine fluid restriction is not recommended and may be detrimental[.44](#page-6-13) A Cochrane review of three trials comparing unrestricted and restricted fluid regimens recommended maintenance of intravenous fluids in settings where children present late and where acute bacterial meningitis mortality is high[.51](#page-6-18) A third of children with acute bacterial meningitis are hyponatremic; therefore resuscitation with isotonic fluids is advocated where appropriate. Intravenous fluids are preferable to the nasogastric route, but may be expensive and the expertise required to deliver them may be lacking in some settings. A trial in Papua New Guinea showed no significant difference in mortality whether children with acute bacterial meningitis were resuscitated with intravenous fluids at 100% maintenance or nasogastric fluids at 60% maintenance, although convulsions in the first 72 hours were higher in the nasogastric fluids group[.52](#page-6-19)

# **VACCINATION**

Conjugate vaccines have substantially reduced the incidence of Hib, pneumococcus, and meningococcus group C meningitis in high-income countries, and of Hib and pneumococcal meningitis in the African countries where these have been introduced[.1](#page-5-0) Conjugate vaccines are the most effective form of immunization for those under 2 years of age who are particularly vulnerable to bacterial meningitis. Hib conjugate vaccines are being administered in an increasing number of countries, with global coverage of at least three doses of 70%. Pneumococcal conjugate vaccine is also being delivered in many countries, with current vaccine coverage rates of approximately 40%. PCV reduces the incidence of vaccineserotype and antibiotic-resistant IPD in HIV-infected children[.53](#page-6-20) As HIV-exposed but uninfected infants are still at increased risk of IPD and mortality from IPD compared with HIV-unexposed and uninfected children, this group of children, whose numbers are continuing to increase in sub-Saharan Africa, should be especially targeted for PCV along with HIV-infected infants and children.[3](#page-5-2) PCV protects HIV-infected adults from recurrent pneumococcal infection caused by vaccine serotype[s54](#page-6-21) and induces more persistent and functional antibody responses in individuals on antiretroviral therapy.[55](#page-6-22) High-income countries have reported an increase in IPD from non-vaccine serotypes with the introduction of PCV. Therefore enhanced surveillance is essential in resource-poor countries where PCV has been introduced.

Single (group A) and quadrivalent capsular polysaccharide meningococcal vaccines have been used in the African meningitis belt, and a conjugate meningococcus group A vaccine (MenAfriVac) has been rolled out in several African countries in the meningitis belt [\(www.meningvax.org](http://www.meningvax.org/))[.1,16](#page-5-0)

# **RISK OF SEVERE SEQUELAE AND DEATH FROM BACTERIAL MENINGITIS**

Severe sequelae from bacterial meningitis results from neuronal injury arising from a number of mechanisms. These include inflammatory mediators, vasculitis, ischemia, edema, hypoperfusion, and acidosis.

In children, impaired consciousness or coma at presentation, weight below the second centile, and longer duration of illness are associated with increased risk of death and severe sequelae.[56,57](#page-6-23) HIV co-infection is associated with increased risk of death but not of developing severe sequelae[.9,57,58](#page-5-23) Pneumococcal meningitis is associated with increased risk of severe sequelae[.57](#page-6-24) A recent systematic review demonstrated that bacterial meningitis is associated with a clinically significant reduction in verbal and performance IQ and with developmental delay in survivors.[59](#page-6-25)

In adults in a high–HIV seroprevalence, resource-poor setting, CSF culture positivity for *S. pneumoniae,* lower CSF white blood cell count, lower hemoglobin, lower GCS, and higher pulse rate were found to be associated with increased risk of death.[60](#page-6-26)
