# **<sup>157</sup> 157** International Adoption

*Cynthia R. Howard, Mary Allen Staat*

# KEY FEATURES

- • The demography of international adoption is in constant flux.
- • Growth failure and malnutrition are commonly seen.
- • Tuberculosis infection and intestinal parasites are the most prevalent infectious diseases.
- • Acute, asymptomatic hepatitis A in adoptees poses a risk for non-immune caregivers.
- • Underimmunization is common, and nearly all children will need additional immunizations.
- • Developmental delays are common, and risk for long-term learning issues is increased.

# **INTRODUCTION**

Each year thousands of children are adopted by citizens of countries other than their country of birth. Underlying reasons for being available for adoption include extreme poverty, death of one or both parents, abandonment due to gender or disability, armed conflict resulting in separation from parents, and other social or cultural determinants.

The demography of international adoption is in constant flux. Consequently, the epidemiology of diseases in this population of children shifts from year to year. Individual health risks vary depending on birth region as well as factors such as intrauterine exposure to infections and toxins, genetic heritage, congenital anomalies, caregiver environment (foster care versus institutional care), food security, exposure to infection, and circumstances leading to the loss of parental care.

Common medical problems for international adoptees include chronic malnutrition, micronutrient deficiencies, latent tuberculosis infection, and intestinal parasites. Undernutrition and growth delays are commonly seen upon arrival. Psychosocial deprivation, particularly long-term institutionalization, has been shown to adversely affect growth in height, weight, and head circumference[.1](#page-3-0) In one study of adoptees from several countries, 28% were chronically malnourished and 5% were acutely malnourished.[2](#page-4-0) Micronutrient deficiencies, including zinc, vitamin D, and iron deficiency, have been documented in children from all countries[.3–5](#page-4-1)

# **OVERALL APPROACH AND INITIAL EVALUATION**

This chapter will focus primarily on infectious disease issues in internationally adopted children. However, it is important that each newly arriving child have a thorough and comprehensive evaluation within the first 2 to 3 weeks of arrival. This initial assessment should include all aspects of general health, including evaluations of the child's growth, development, vision, hearing, dental, and mental health. Children with previously unidentified chronic medical conditions may appear relatively healthy, and children may have undiagnosed congenital anomalies and genetic disorders.

Beyond infectious disease screening, several other tests are recommended, including a blood lead concentration, complete blood cell count with red blood cell indices to evaluate for anemia and differential of white blood cells to evaluate for eosinophilia, glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase screening, hemoglobin electrophoresis, and measurement of thyroid-stimulating hormone concentration. In addition, a thorough physical examination should be done to document birthmarks and scars, as well as examine for congenital anomalies. Mental health screening is for feeding, sleeping, attachment, and behavioral issues, as well as overall family transitioning. For children older than 18 to 24 months of age, when possible, an interpreter should be used who is proficient in the child's native language. [Table 157.1](#page-1-0) outlines the recommended evaluations to be done.

Most children will have documentation of screening results for syphilis, hepatitis B, HIV, and tuberculosis in their birth countries. This testing should be repeated after arriving to the United States because the results may not be reliable or the child may have become infected after the testing was done. [Table 157.2](#page-2-0) outlines the recommended infectious disease tests to be done, and next we provide more details for selected infectious diseases.

# **TUBERCULOSIS**

Tuberculosis infection is commonly identified in children who are internationally adopted, and therefore tuberculosis testing is recommended for all internationally adopted children at their initial visit. Tuberculosis prevalence varies by age and birth country. In a study of 527 adoptees, 21% had a positive tuberculin skin test (TST) on arrival. Of those with an initially negative TST, 47% had a repeat TST 3 months or more after arrival, and 20% of these were positive. Possible explanations for conversion include a birth country exposure just before departure and improvement in nutritional status with boosting of the TST. Thus children with initially negative tuberculosis testing should have repeat testing done 3 to 6 months after arrival[.6](#page-4-2)

Both TSTs and interferon-gamma release assays (IGRAs) such as T-SPOT or QuantiFERON-TB GOLD are acceptable tests for tuberculosis screening in children ≥2 years, whereas a TST is recommended for children <2 years of age. IGRAs have the advantage of distinguishing tuberculosis infection from bacillus Calmette–Guérin (BCG) response and do not require follow-up or interpretation of reaction. With that said, the TST should be placed regardless of BCG vaccination status, and a TST reaction of ≥10 mm in a child from a country endemic for tuberculosis should not be attributed to a history of BCG receipt. Children with a positive IGRA or TST (reaction ≥10 mm induration 48–72 hours post-placement) should be evaluated for tuberculosis disease with a physical examination and chest radiograph to assess for extrapulmonary and pulmonary tuberculosis[.7](#page-4-3) If there is evidence of disease, every effort should be made to isolate the organism, particularly if the child is from a region of the world with a high rate of multidrug-resistant tuberculosis. For children with tuberculosis infection without manifested disease, a 9-month course of daily isoniazid or a once-weekly, directly observed 12-week course of isoniazid/rifapentine (if child >2 years) can be given.

# **HEPATITIS A**

Internationally adopted children come from countries with high rates of hepatitis A infection and may be acutely infected, asymptomatic, and shedding virus when they join their family,

placing non-immune adoptive families, caregivers, and others with whom they may come in contact (e.g., daycare) at risk for hepatitis A infection. Serology has proven useful in identifying these acutely infected children so hepatitis A vaccine can be provided to those at risk for exposure. One study found acute hepatitis A (immunoglobulin M [IgM] positive) in 10% of Ethiopian adoptees upon arrival to the United States[.8](#page-4-4) In 2009, the Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices recommended that people anticipating close contact with an internationally adopted child within 60 days after arrival from a country known for intermediate or high rates of hepatitis A should be vaccinated against hepatitis A.[9](#page-4-5)

# **HEPATITIS B**

Similar to other infectious diseases, the prevalence of hepatitis B infection is higher in the birth countries of international adoptees compared with the prevalence in the United States. Most internationally adopted children with hepatitis B virus (HBV) infection have acquired it at birth and are asymptomatic with a prevalence ranging from 1% to 3%[.10](#page-4-6) All internationally adopted children should have HBV serology at their initial visit to include hepatitis B surface antigen, surface antibody, and core antibody. Children with a positive hepatitis B surface antigen need additional testing to determine whether they have acute or chronic infection. The presence of hepatitis B core IgM antibody indicates an acute infection; if the IgM is negative and there is persistence of the surface antigen for 6 months or longer, the child is then diagnosed with chronic HBV infection. Children who initially test negative for hepatitis B surface antibody and antigen should be retested 3 to 6 months later. All members of the household adopting a child who is HBV-infected should be immunized and should have post-immunization antibody titers to determine whether levels are consistent with protection[.11](#page-4-7) The HBV-infected child should be vaccinated against hepatitis A if they are not immune and tested for hepatitis C. Referral to a pediatric gastroenterologist is indicated for further evaluation and management.

# **HEPATITIS C**

The prevalence of hepatitis C in the birth countries of internationally adopted children is not well described; the prevalence in internationally adopted children has been low (<1%). Routine screening with enzyme immunosorbent assay (EIA) should be done because hepatitis C infection in children is asymptomatic, screening for risk factors is not possible, and effective treatments are now available. If the EIA is positive, a polymerase chain reaction (PCR) should be done in follow-up. Children with a positive hepatitis C PCR should be tested for hepatitis A virus (HAV), HBV, and HIV. If non-immune for HAV and HBV, they should receive hepatitis A and B vaccines. All children with hepatitis C should be referred to a pediatric gastroenterologist for further evaluation and management.

# **SYPHILIS**

Although the prevalence of syphilis has been low in published studies, screening for *Treponema pallidum* is recommended for all internationally adopted children because syphilis can have long-term complications in inadequately treated children. Both treponemal and non-treponemal tests are recommended for initial screening. In most cases, treponemal tests remain positive for a lifetime even after appropriate treatment. If a child is found to have a positive treponemal test and there is not appropriate documentation of the child's evaluation (assessing for active disease and neurosyphilis) or treatment (with the type of penicillin, dose, interval, and duration), the evaluation should be repeated in the United States. If there is evidence of syphilis, the child should be treated according to the recommendations by the American Academy of Pediatrics or the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention's Sexually Transmitted Infection Guidelines[.12](#page-4-8)

Children from tropical regions may have positive treponemal tests due to spirochete infections other than syphilis such as yaws, pinta, and bejel, but differentiation between syphilis and these infections may be impossible unless active lesions are present. If syphilis cannot be excluded satisfactorily, a full evaluation for disease must be undertaken and appropriate treatment given.

# **HIV**

Despite the increasing number of children orphaned due to HIV, the prevalence of HIV infection among internationally adopted children has been low; however, increasing numbers of HIV-positive children are now being adopted. All internationally adopted children should be screened on arrival for HIV antibodies. In young infants <6 months of age (or in children with negative HIV antibody and symptoms suggestive of HIV), HIV PCR should be done. Some experts recommend a follow-up antibody screen 3 to 6 months after arrival to detect infection that may have occurred immediately before departure from the country of birth.

# **INTESTINAL PATHOGENS**

Intestinal parasites are very common in internationally adopted children with varying rates by age and birth country. Older children and children from Haiti and Africa have the highest prevalence. *Giardia lamblia* is the most commonly identified parasite. Other common intestinal parasites include *Blastocystis hominis, Dientamoeba fragilis,* and *Hymenolepis nana.* Screening for intestinal parasites is recommended for all internationally adopted children with three stool samples, each to be collected in the early morning, 2 to 3 days apart, to be tested for: (1) ova and parasites ×3 with one

sample tested for (2) giardia and cryptosporidium antigens[.13](#page-4-11) There have not been studies evaluating the prevalence of bacterial enteric infections in internationally adopted children. Bacterial testing is not routinely recommended but should be done for children with bloody diarrhea or if diarrhea and intestinal parasite testing is unrevealing.

# **MALARIA**

Testing for malaria should be done in any child from a malariaendemic area who has fever, unexplained anemia, and/or splenomegaly using three sets (every 12 hours) of thin and thick blood smears and rapid diagnostic testing. Screening for malaria parasites should be considered for internationally adopted children coming from areas where the disease is endemic (Ethiopia, India, Haiti, and most countries in sub-Saharan Africa).[8](#page-4-4) Additional studies are needed to determine whether routine screening should be done in asymptomatic children from these countries.

# **EOSINOPHILIA**

Patients with eosinophilia are often asymptomatic. A complete blood count with differential should be done with the initial screening tests to identify anemia and eosinophilia. An absolute

eosinophil count >450 per mm3 requires further investigation, including three stools for ova and parasites to identify tissuemigrating helminths. If the eosinophilia is persistent or high and no helminths are identified, additional testing should be done, including serologic tests for *Strongyloides stercoralis,* provided child has not received presumptive therapy with albendazole or ivermectin, *Schistosoma* spp., lymphatic filariasis, and *Toxocara canis.* Other testing may be indicated by history, physical examination, and country of birth. Additional information about evaluation and management of eosinophilia can be found in Chapter 155.

# **SKIN DISEASE**

Skin conditions are very common in internationally adopted children, warranting careful examination and documentation on the child's initial evaluation. In a study of 142 internationally adopted children, 70% were found to have one or more types of skin conditions. More than 50% presented within the first month of arrival and >50% had an infectious etiology. Thirty percent had a fungal infection, *Tinea capitis* being the most common. A viral skin disease was found in 15%, with *Molluscum contagiosum* seen most often. Other skin infections included scabies and impetigo. Prompt diagnosis and treatment are indicated to relieve symptoms and prevent spread.[14](#page-4-12)

# **IMMUNIZATIONS**

Nearly all internationally adopted children are underimmunized. The availability and reliability of immunization records from the birth countries of adoptees vary even within a given birth country. Practitioners can choose from three clinically sound approaches to immunization: (1) screen for quantitative antibody levels to verify immunity, (2) immunize according to age and catch-up schedule, and (3) a combination of antibody testing and catch-up immunization. Antibody testing for diphtheria, tetanus, *Haemophilus influenzae* type b, and hepatitis B can be done for children ≥6 months of age, and measles, mumps, rubella, and varicella can be done for children ≥12 months of age. There are no correlates of protection for pertussis, so diphtheria and tetanus antibody levels are used to infer immunity for pertussis.[15](#page-4-13) If age-appropriate documentation according to World Health Organization (WHO) or U.S. recommendations with bivalent oral polio vaccine (OPV) or inactivated polio vaccine (IPV) is not available, age-appropriate vaccination with IPV is recommended. Although testing for polio immunity was recommended in the past, because polio serotype 2 has been eradicated, antibody testing is no longer available in many U.S. labs[.16](#page-4-14) Administration of pneumococcal vaccine (PCV) 13 is recommended rather than testing for IgG to 13 *Pneumococcus* serotypes. Influenza vaccination is recommended yearly. In addition, other vaccines such as human papillomavirus and meningococcal vaccines should be given as recommended for age.

# **CONCLUSION**

Providing care for internationally adopted children and their families can be rewarding. A comprehensive initial evaluation with screening for infectious and non-infectious conditions and determining immunization needs is critical not only for the health and prevention of disease in these children but also for the prevention of disease in their families and communities.
