# **32.4** Kaposi's Sarcoma–Associated Herpesvirus

*Catherine G. Sutcliffe, William J. Moss*

### KEY FEATURES

- • Kaposi's sarcoma–associated herpesvirus (KSHV) is associated with three lymphoproliferative disorders: Kaposi's sarcoma, which is a cutaneous malignancy; primary effusion lymphoma; and multi-centric Castleman's disease.
- • The epidemiology of KSHV transmission varies, with sexual transmission predominant in many regions, and salivary transmission common among children in parts of sub-Saharan Africa.
- • Kaposi's sarcoma occurs in four clinical and epidemiologic types: classic, endemic, immunosuppressed-associated, and AIDS-associated.
- • Endemic Kaposi's sarcoma is found in central Africa, where children are prone to a rapidly fatal, lymphadenopathic form.
- • Combination antiretroviral therapy can reduce the incidence of Kaposi's sarcoma and the severity of pre-existing lesions in persons co-infected with HIV.

#### **INTRODUCTION**

Kaposi's sarcoma–associated herpesvirus (KSHV), also called *human herpesvirus 8 (HHV-8),* is a member of the lymphotropic gammaherpesviruses, which includes Epstein–Barr virus. As with other herpesviruses, KSHV likely evolved and migrated out of Africa with modern humans. Kaposi's sarcoma, a multi-focal cutaneous neoplasm of vascular endothelium, was first described by the Hungarian dermatologist Moritz Kaposi in 1872 as an indolent neoplasm of older men residing in Eastern Europe and the Mediterranean. A more aggressive form of endemic Kaposi's sarcoma was subsequently identified in children and adults in Africa, particularly in the region surrounding Lake Kivu in the Democratic Republic of Congo and Rwanda, where it accounts for up to 10% of all malignancies in children. With the advent of immunosuppressive therapies for organ transplantation, Kaposi's sarcoma was recognized as a complication of immune suppression, and the disease became widely known as a signal event of the AIDS epidemic[.1](#page-2-0) These four variants correspond to the classic, endemic, immunosuppressed-associated, and AIDS-associated forms. The etiology of Kaposi's sarcoma remained elusive until KSHV was identified in 1994 by representational difference analysis of viral DNA fragments from tissue samples[.2](#page-2-1)

#### **EPIDEMIOLOGY**

KSHV is only found in humans. There are four distinct subtypes: subtypes A and C are predominantly found in Europe, the United States, Asia, and the Middle East; subtype B is predominantly found in sub-Saharan Africa; and subtype D is predominantly found in south Asia, Australia, and the Pacific Islands.

Although infection with KSHV occurs worldwide, the prevalence of infection varies [\(Table 32.4.1](#page-0-1)).[3,4](#page-2-2) In the United States, Asia, Europe, South America, and the Caribbean, the overall prevalence of KSHV infection is less than 10%. In these regions, KSHV is primarily sexually transmitted. Pre-pubertal children are not usually infected, and the prevalence of infection increases with age after the onset of sexual activity. In these epidemiologic settings, KSHV infections are more common among men than women. Male homosexual transmission appears to be more efficient than heterosexual transmission, with seroprevalences ranging from 25% to 60% among men who have sex with men and increasing with the number of sexual partners.

In the Mediterranean, the prevalence of KSHV infection ranges from 15% to 25%. In sub-Saharan Africa and American Indian populations in South America, however, KSHV is endemic, with the prevalence of infection at 50% to 60% or higher [\(Fig. 32.4.1](#page-1-0)). In these regions, most infections are acquired in childhood, suggesting transmission through non-sexual routes.[4](#page-2-3) Salivary transmission, often through contact within the family, is the predominant mode of transmission. After puberty, the prevalence of KSHV rises slowly as a result of less efficient heterosexual transmission. The prevalence of KSHV among adults in sub-Saharan Africa has been found to be higher among men than women, potentially due to both biological and behavioral factors[.5](#page-2-4) Mother-to-child transmission of KSHV can occur but is infrequent[,6](#page-2-5) and the virus is not found in breast milk.[7](#page-2-6) Studies in Africa have found different age-related patterns of KSHV infection, suggesting different patterns of transmission within endemic regions[.8](#page-2-7)

## **NATURAL HISTORY, PATHOGENESIS, AND PATHOLOGY**

The natural history of KSHV begins with infection of endothelial cells and B lymphocytes after contact with infected secretions.

Viral latency is established in B lymphocytes, resulting in lifelong infection. KSHV cycles between two phases: a latent phase during which the virus lies silent with limited gene expression, and a lytic phase with active replication in the oropharynx and viral shedding in saliva. Similar to other herpesviruses, KSHV evolved mechanisms to evade host immune responses, including modulation of immune surveillance and anti-viral responses. The viral genome also encodes oncogenic proteins capable of dysregulating cell growth that are likely involved in the pathogenesis of the associated proliferative disorders. Histologically, Kaposi's sarcoma is characterized by spindle cells with vascular spaces and extravasated red blood cells. The lesions of Kaposi's sarcoma are multi-centric in origin and not the result of metastases.

#### **CLINICAL FEATURES**

Infection with KSHV is asymptomatic in most individuals, but some children with primary infection may have a non-specific febrile illness.<sup>11</sup> More importantly, KSHV infection is associated with three lymphoproliferative disorders, primarily in immunocompromised hosts: Kaposi's sarcoma, primary effusion lymphoma, and multicentric Castleman's disease. The lesions of Kaposi's sarcoma are commonly flat or raised nodules, 0.5 to 2.0 cm in diameter, with a purple hue as a consequence of numerous poorly oxygenated red blood cells (Fig. 32.4.2). With more advanced disease, these nodules may coalesce. Lesions are common in the mouth and on the face, nose, and extremities but can also occur in the lung, biliary tract, and gastrointestinal tract. Children in endemic areas are more likely to have a rapidly fatal lymphadenopathic form that leads to edema (see Fig. 32.4.2). Some lesions of Kaposi's sarcoma may spontaneously regress, confounding the evaluation of treatment strategies. Uniform staging criteria for Kaposi's sarcoma do not exist, although several classification systems have been proposed, including for HIV-infected individuals.

# PATIENT EVALUATION, DIAGNOSIS, AND DIFFERENTIAL DIAGNOSIS

Infection with KSHV is diagnosed serologically or by detection of viral DNA in saliva, tissue, or blood samples. The diagnosis of Kaposi's sarcoma should be considered in patients with compatible

skin or mucous membrane lesions and who reside in an endemic area or are HIV-infected or immunosuppressed. The diagnosis is made by careful physical examination of the skin and mucosal surfaces. Pathologic examination of the biopsied lesions shows the characteristic highly vascular, spindle-shaped cells, although histologic variants with mixed cell or anaplastic types are not uncommon. Detection of gastrointestinal or pulmonary lesions requires imaging studies, such as a chest radiograph, although pulmonary findings are often non-specific. Clinical diagnosis is usually not problematic in persons with multiple lesions and with the appropriate clinical context. Isolated lesions, however, may be confused with hemangiomas, dermatofibromas, or pyogenic granulomas. Kaposi's sarcoma may be clinically confused with bacillary angiomatosis caused by the gram-negative bacteria *Rochalimaea,* with the two distinguished by histology.

#### **PREVENTION AND TREATMENT**

Methods to prevent sexually transmitted infections, such as the use of condoms, may prevent sexual transmission of KSHV. For persons co-infected with HIV, combination antiretroviral therapy is associated with a reduction in the incidence of Kaposi's sarcoma and regression in the size and number of existing lesions[.12,13](#page-2-11) Local therapy for palliation of symptomatic lesions or for cosmetically unacceptable lesions can be achieved through a variety of means, including radiation therapy, surgical excision, cryotherapy, intralesional administration of anti-neoplastic agents, and topical retinoids. Systemic therapy is reserved for rapidly progressive or severe disease and includes immune modulators (e.g., interferon-α) and chemotherapy.[14](#page-2-12) Antiviral therapy with ganciclovir, foscarnet, or cidofovir has demonstrated some efficacy in small studies, but the virus is resistant to acyclovir.
