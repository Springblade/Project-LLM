# **<sup>65</sup> 65** Anthrax

*Arthur M. Friedlander, Nicholas J. Vietri*

#### KEY FEATURES

- • Anthrax is an acute bacterial zoonosis predominantly of herbivorous animals.
- • It is caused by *Bacillus anthracis* that persists in the environment as dormant spores and may be transmitted to humans by inoculation, inhalation, or ingestion.
- • The majority of naturally occurring human cases involve the skin; only very rarely are the respiratory and gastrointestinal tracts affected.
- • Cutaneous anthrax is characterized by the development of a papule followed by a black eschar, often surrounded by significant edema. It may be complicated by septicemia and death in 5% to 20% of untreated cases.
- • Inhalational anthrax and gastrointestinal anthrax, both characterized by regional lymphadenitis and septicemia, have a mortality rate approaching 100% if untreated and ≈50% even with antimicrobial therapy and supportive care.
- • Vaccines are available.

#### **INTRODUCTION**

Anthrax is an acute bacterial zoonosis, predominantly of herbivores, caused b*y Bacillus anthracis.* Animal anthrax is rare in developed nations as a result of intensive surveillance and control. However, the disease remains endemic in animals and is not uncommon in humans in many developing countries. Humans become infected after contact with infected animals or contaminated animal products by inoculation, ingestion, or inhalation. A major concern is the use of anthrax to intentionally cause disease, as occurred in 2001 with the mailing of letters containing anthrax spores.

#### **EPIDEMIOLOGY**

#### **Incidence of Human Anthrax**

Human infection with *B. anthracis* is infrequent in developed countries. Approximately 20,000 to 100,000 cases of human anthrax are estimated to occur annually worldwide, although accurate figures are impossible to obtain. However, anthrax is ubiquitous in agricultural nations dependent on animal husbandry. Epidemics of human anthrax are rare. Large outbreaks of cutaneous anthrax occurred during wars in Zimbabwe in 1978 to 1980 and in Chad in 1988. The largest epidemic of inhalational anthrax occurred in 1979 in Sverdlovsk (Ekaterinburg), Russia, resulting from the accidental release of spores from a military facility. In 2001, 22 cases of bioterrorism-related anthrax (11 inhalational) occurred after envelopes containing spores were mailed through the U.S. Postal Service.

#### **Zoonotic Anthrax**

Anthrax is chiefly a disease of herbivores. Animals are infected via the gastrointestinal tract by grazing on contaminated pasture and rarely by contact with other infected animals. Before death, animals often contaminate the soil with infected saliva, blood, urine, or feces. Soil, forage, and, to a lesser extent, groundwater are major reservoirs of anthrax.

#### **Geographic Occurrence**

Outbreaks are sporadic in developed nations, whereas disease remains endemic in parts of Africa, India, Southeast Asia, the Middle East, Greece, Albania, southern Italy, Romania, the former Soviet Union, and Central and South America [\(Fig. 65.1\)](#page-1-0). *B. anthracis* spores germinate in soil at 20° to 44°C in areas with >85% humidity. Germinated bacilli are destroyed by other soil microbes. Therefore in many tropical regions, animal anthrax occurs predominantly in the dry season, with some persistence into the wet season. It is likely that persistence in soil results from amplification caused by growth in infected animals and sporulation in animal carcasses with subsequent contamination of the soil. Vultures and non-biting flies may be responsible for dissemination of anthrax.

## **Human Anthrax**

Human anthrax is traced to agricultural, industrial, or, rarely, laboratory acquisition. Only two cases of human-to-human transmission have been reported involving contact with a cutaneous case.

#### **Industrially Acquired Anthrax**

In economically developed countries, industrial acquisition accounts for ≈80% of cutaneous anthrax and almost all inhalational anthrax, and occurs predominantly among tanners or leather, hair, wool, or bone-meal fertilizer workers. Sub-clinical infection and seroconversion among workers in these industries may be more common than overt illness. Infections in developed countries are acquired from contaminated animal hides, hair, or bones imported from developing countries with zoonotic anthrax. Leather goods and drums from Haiti and West Africa have been vehicles of anthrax transmission. Recently cutaneous cases have been seen in heroin addicts in four European countries.

#### **Agricultural Anthrax**

In developed countries, contact with infected animals by farmers, butchers, and veterinarians is implicated in ≈20% of cutaneous cases. Transmission by biting insects has been suspected and bone-meal fertilizer implicated in sporadic cases of inhalational anthrax among gardeners.

#### **NATURAL HISTORY, PATHOGENESIS, AND PATHOLOGY**

Anthrax bacilli are large (1.0–1.5 µm by 3–8 µm), non-motile, gram-positive rods. Abundant in smears of blood and tissues, bacilli occur singly or in short chains. *B. anthracis* also develops spores in culture or soil, but not in vivo unless exposed to ambient air. Spores are resistant to heat and many disinfectants. Spores are destroyed by boiling for 10 minutes, dry heat (140°C) for 3 hours, or autoclaving (121°C) for 15 minutes, but remain viable for years in dry soil. Cattle have become infected by grazing in fields where animals died of anthrax decades before[.1](#page-5-0)

#### *Bacillus anthracis* **Virulence Factors**

*B. anthracis* possesses three major virulence factors: a polyγ-D-glutamic acid capsule and two protein exotoxins. The capsule is anti-phagocytic, enabling the bacillus to resist killing by leukocytes. The anthrax toxins are composed of a eukaryotic cell receptor–binding protein and a second protein possessing cytotoxic activity. The cell receptor–binding protein protective antigen combines with edema factor, a calmodulin-dependent adenylate cyclase, to produce edema toxin or, with lethal factor, a zinc metalloprotease, to produce a lethal toxin. Protective antigen is necessary for binding and translocation of the cytotoxic proteins. Edema toxin raises intracelluar levels of cyclic adenosine monophosphate (cAMP), interfering with cell function, whereas lethal factor inactivates mitogen-activated protein (MAP) kinases, interfering with signal transduction.[2](#page-5-1) The toxins interfere with innate immunity, having been shown in vitro to impair the function of neutrophils, macrophages, lymphocytes, and dendritic cells[.3](#page-5-2) Additional effects of toxins occur in vivo because toxin receptors are expressed on many cells, including those of the cardiovascular system and liver.[4](#page-5-3)

#### **Cutaneous Anthrax**

Cutaneous anthrax follows inoculation of spores into skin. Spores then germinate, and the bacilli multiply and elaborate their virulence factors. Hematogenous dissemination follows in 5% to 20% of untreated cases. Cutaneous lesions may demonstrate satellite bullous lesions in which gram-positive bacilli can be observed; pus is not present.

#### **Inhalational Anthrax**

Inhalational anthrax follows the inhalation of spores of 1 to 5 µm in diameter. Larger particles are cleared by the mucociliary mechanism of the lungs. Spore aerosols may be encountered by workers handling contaminated batches of hair, wool, or bone-meal fertilizer. The aerosol infective dose for human infection is high: in wool mills, non-immune workers inhaled as many as 510 spores of 5 µm or less in diameter per 8-hour shift without becoming ill. Animal studies indicate that inhaled spores are ingested by alveolar phagocytes and carried to tracheobronchial and mediastinal lymph nodes. There, the spores germinate into bacilli with the production of capsule and toxins. Hemorrhagic edema and necrosis of mediastinal lymph nodes ensue. Alveoli show a hemorrhagic exudate and only rarely bacilli; neutrophils are usually absent. Alveolar capillaries contain fibrin thrombi and bacilli.[5](#page-5-4) Hemorrhagic pleural effusions commonly occur. Hematogenous dissemination to the meninges, spleen, and intestine can occur.

#### **Gastrointestinal Anthrax**

Oropharyngeal and intestinal anthrax follow ingestion of poorly cooked, contaminated meat[.6](#page-5-5) An ulcer in the stomach, terminal ileum, or cecum may be present, and hemorrhage and edema of regional lymphatics occur.

#### **Septicemic Anthrax**

Generalized sepsis may follow cutaneous anthrax and, almost invariably, accompanies inhalational and gastrointestinal anthrax. Vascular injury may result from the proliferation of bacteria in the blood and effects of the exotoxins acting directly on the endothelium or indirectly through other mediators. Widespread capillary thrombosis, circulatory failure, and shock occur before death. Adrenocortical hemorrhage can occur. In addition, anthrax bacteremia may lead to hemorrhagic meningitis. The leptomeninges reveal scant inflammation but widespread hemorrhages. The brain has hemorrhages and generalized cerebral edema. Sub-arachnoid hemorrhage may also occur.

#### **CLINICAL FEATURES**

#### **Cutaneous Anthrax**

Cutaneous anthrax accounts for >95% of human infections and commonly involves areas of the face, neck, hands, and arms[.7](#page-5-6) The incubation period is 12 hours to 7 (mean 3) days. The initial lesion

<span id="page-2-0"></span>is a small, erythematous macule or papule. It turns brown and develops a ring of erythema and a vesicle. Vesicular satellite lesions may appear [\(Fig. 65.2](#page-2-0)) and, after a few days, the clear, vesicular fluid becomes blue-black from hemorrhage. The papule ulcerates, developing a black eschar by the fifth to seventh day. Non-pitting, gelatinous edema may be prominent, occasionally extending to the iliac crest from lesions of the head and neck. This so-called *malignant edema,* together with a black eschar, is pathognomonic for anthrax. Patients have few symptoms, most commonly malaise, headache, and low-grade fever.

#### **Inhalational Anthrax**

Inhalational anthrax accounts for <5% of reported cases. Nonspecific symptoms of mild fever, malaise, fatigue, and myalgia develop 1 to 5 days after exposure; non-productive cough is often reported. In cases occurring in the 2001 epidemic, nausea or vomiting was common,[8](#page-5-7) and some had extreme fatigue and severe headache. Patients may have transient improvement after several days or may directly develop severe respiratory distress with cyanosis, diaphoresis, increased fever, and tachycardia. Stridor, diffuse rales, and basilar dullness may be heard. Chest radiographs reveal symmetric, characteristic mediastinal widening; pleural effusions; and, in some cases, patchy infiltrates [\(Fig. 65.3\)](#page-2-1). Massive, superficial edema of the head and neck may occur. Meningitis, often hemorrhagic, occurs in ≈50% of cases. Pleural effusions may also be hemorrhagic. *B. anthracis* is usually isolated in cultures of blood, pleural fluid, and cerebrospinal fluid.

#### **Gastrointestinal Anthrax**

Oropharyngeal and gastrointestinal anthrax account for <5% of cases. Oropharyngeal anthrax presents with sore throat, an ulcer in the oral cavity, dysphagia, cervical and sub-mandibular

<span id="page-2-1"></span>lymphadenopathy, and often dramatic neck edema. Gastrointestinal anthrax develops after an incubation period of 2 to 5 days. Patients have generalized abdominal pain, anorexia, nausea, vomiting, and, in some cases, hematemesis. Severe prostration accompanies the development of ascites, bloody diarrhea, toxemia, and shock. Subcutaneous edema may extensively involve the lower trunk.

#### **Central Nervous System Anthrax**

Anthrax meningitis follows bacteremia from a cutaneous, pulmonary, or intestinal source. Patients usually present with fever, meningismus, and rapidly deteriorating mental status. Lumbar puncture reveals spinal fluid containing gram-positive rods and is often hemorrhagic. Bacteremia occurs in 70% of patients; the usual survival is 2 to 4 days. In very rare cases, patients present with isolated meningitis without other evidence of disease.

#### **PATIENT EVALUATION, DIAGNOSIS, AND DIFFERENTIAL DIAGNOSIS**

#### **Differential Diagnosis**

The epidemiologic background of an industrial or agricultural exposure, the evolution of a pruritic then painless lesion without cellulitis or lymphangitis, and the dramatic appearance of the black eschar and extensive non-pitting edema help to distinguish anthrax from other skin infections. The initial, non-specific symptoms of inhalational anthrax may resemble influenza, bronchitis, or the common cold; however, there are no upper respiratory symptoms in inhalational anthrax.[9](#page-5-8) The later stage may mimic congestive cardiac failure, but should be suggested by mediastinal widening on chest radiographs in the setting of occupational exposure. Anthrax meningitis may be confused with other forms of bacterial meningitis or sub-arachnoid hemorrhage. Intestinal anthrax with fever and severe abdominal pain will only be recognized pre-surgery or pre-mortem if the appropriate epidemiologic history is obtained.

#### **Direct Smear and Culture Diagnosis**

In cutaneous anthrax, encapsulated bacilli can be identified on gram- or Giemsa-stained smears and readily cultured. Bacilli may also be abundant in cerebrospinal or pleural fluid in cases of inhalational anthrax. Direct fluorescent antibody stains for cell wall and capsule are available for definitive, early identification of *B. anthracis* from vesicular fluid, tissue, or culture. On sheep blood agar, 3- to 5-mm, gray-white, opaque, rough, non-hemolytic colonies become evident within 24 hours. In the presence of carbon dioxide, the organism produces a capsule and the colony is round and mucoid. Identification is confirmed immunologically by the presence of the capsule, susceptibility to specific bacteriophage, and testing by polymerase chain reaction (PCR) for toxin and capsule genes.

#### **Serologic Diagnosis**

Antibody to protective antigen or capsule, measured by enzymelinked immunosorbent assay (ELISA), develops in 67% to 94% of cases of cutaneous or oropharyngeal anthrax and in 100% of inhalational anthrax cases, but is only useful retrospectively. Rapid diagnostic tests for the detection of protective antigen, lethal factor, and capsule in body fluids have been developed and shown to be of value in non-human primate models and one human case.

#### **TREATMENT**

Consensus treatment recommendations for both adults and children are available and have recently been updated.[10,11](#page-5-9)

## **Cutaneous Anthrax**

Untreated cutaneous anthrax can progress to septicemia, shock, renal failure, and, in 5% to 20% of cases, death. Almost all cutaneous cases are cured with effective antimicrobial therapy. Treatment with an oral fluoroquinolone (ciprofloxacin, levofloxacin, or moxifloxacin) or doxycycline for 7 to 10 days is recommended by the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) for uncomplicated cases of naturally acquired cutaneous anthrax[,10](#page-5-9)

although a study conducted in Turkey suggests that antibiotic treatment for 3 to 5 days is as effective as 7 to 10 days. Clindamycin is an alternative option if fluoroquinolones or doxycycline is unavailable or contraindicated. Oral therapy with amoxicillin or penicillin VK can be used for penicillin-sensitive isolates. For cutaneous anthrax associated with a bioterrorism attack, the duration of treatment is 60 days, due to potential exposure to airborne spores. Amoxicillin can be used to complete the 60-day course for penicillin-sensitive isolates. Recommended antibiotics and doses for both adults and children for the treatment of cutaneous anthrax are shown in [Table 65.1.](#page-3-0) [10,11](#page-5-9) Treatment for severe cutaneous anthrax with bacteremia is the same as for inhalational and gastrointestinal anthrax, which require intravenous antibiotics as described later.

#### **Other Anthrax Syndromes**

Historically, the treatment for systemic anthrax, which includes cutaneous anthrax with bacteremia and inhalational and gastrointestinal anthrax, was high-dose intravenous penicillin. However, the recently updated CDC anthrax treatment guidelines, based on experience derived from the 2001 cases, recommend a multi-drug regimen of intravenous antibiotics for systemic anthrax.[10,11](#page-5-9) The specific antibiotics recommended are based on whether meningitis is suspected, confirmed, or ruled out. If meningitis has not been ruled out, the guidelines recommend three or more antimicrobial drugs with activity against *B. anthracis,* including a fluoroquinolone, a β-lactam, and a protein synthesis inhibitor. All the antimicrobial agents should have good central nervous system (CNS) penetration. The duration of IV antibiotic treatment is for ≥2 weeks or until the patient is clinically stable, whichever is longer. The treatment of systemic anthrax where meningitis has been ruled out is similar to the treatment with meningitis, with the following exceptions. First two or more antimicrobial drugs should be used. At least one of these should have bactericidal activity and at least one should be a protein synthesis inhibitor. If the *B. anthracis* infecting

Duration of PO therapy for non-systemic cutaneous anthrax is 7 to 10 days.

Duration of IV therapy of anthrax with possible or confirmed meningitis is ≥2 weeks or until clinically stable, whichever is longer.

Duration of IV therapy for anthrax when meningitis has been excluded is ≥2 weeks or until clinically stable, whichever is longer.

All patients exposed to aerosolized spores will require prophylaxis to complete an antimicrobial drug course of 60 days from onset of illness.

Preferred antimicrobial agents are in bold font.

strain is susceptible to penicillin, then penicillin G is considered to be equivalent to the fluoroquinolones as the bactericidal agent. Finally, antimicrobial drug penetration into the CNS is not as important. Recommended antibiotics and doses for the treatment of systemic anthrax, with and without suspected meningitis, for both adults and children are given in [Table 65.1](#page-3-0). [10,11](#page-5-9) To complete a 60-day course of therapy, treatment can be switched to oral medicines when the patient is stable. There are no controlled studies for human inhalational anthrax to determine the optimal duration of treatment and if a shorter period is adequate—the suggested 60-day course of antibiotics is based on the possible germination of retained dormant spores late after infection. Although historically viewed as invariably fatal, data from the 2001 inhalational anthrax cases showed that a multi-drug antibiotic regimen combined with supportive therapy reduced mortality to 45%.[12](#page-5-10)

### **Anti-Toxin**

The use of an anti-toxin in conjunction with antimicrobial therapy is recommended for the treatment of systemic anthrax, although there are no controlled clinical studies demonstrating its added benefit. There are three anti-toxins in the CDC Strategic National Stockpile: raxibacumab (GlaxoSmithKline, London, UK), anthrax immune globulin intravenous (AIGIV) (Emergent BioSolutions, Gaithersburg, MD, USA), and obiltoxaximab (Elusys Therapeutics Inc, Pine Brook, NJ, USA).

#### **Supportive Therapy**

The evolution of the anthrax skin lesion is not modified by antimicrobial treatment. Pleural fluid drainage was likely associated with decreased mortality in the 2001 anthrax cases by reducing toxin levels and decreasing lung compression. Although data in anthrax are lacking, adjunctive intravenous dexamethasone is recommended in addition to antimicrobial therapy for patients suspected of having meningitis.

#### **Isolation of Patients**

Human-to-human transmission has not been observed in inhalational or gastrointestinal anthrax. Therefore standard infection control precautions should suffice. However, if bloody sputum is present, respiratory isolation should be instituted. Because of the potential infectious nature of an untreated cutaneous anthrax lesion

#### **Post-Exposure Prophylaxis**

Post-exposure prophylaxis (PEP) requires a different therapeutic approach compared with treatment of established disease. Most spores deposited into the alveolar spaces germinate within a few days. However, germination is not synchronous. Studies have demonstrated viable spores in the lungs of rhesus macaques 100 days after exposure, and anthrax has occurred several months after exposure in animals given antibiotics for short periods. As spores can remain dormant for long periods and antibiotics act only after spores have germinated, PEP to prevent disease from dormant spores that may subsequently germinate requires either a prolonged course of antibiotics or antibiotics plus vaccination. The current CDC recommendation for PEP for exposure to aerosolized *B. anthracis* spores is 60 days of oral antibiotics combined with anthrax vaccine (BioThrax) 0.5 mL given subcutaneously at 0, 2, and 4 weeks[.13,14](#page-5-14) Antibiotics recommended for PEP include ciprofloxacin or doxycycline. Levofloxacin, moxifloxacin, or clindamycin are recommended as a second-line antibiotic. Penicillins should not be used presumptively for PEP of anthrax. However, once the strain is proven to be penicillin-susceptible, amoxicillin or penicillin VK can be used to complete the 60-day course of therapy. The recommended antibiotics and doses for anthrax PEP for both adults and children are listed in [Table 65.2](#page-5-15).
