# **36.3** Zika

*Lin H. Chen, Mary E. Wilson*

# KEY FEATURES

- • Zika virus, a flavivirus, has re-emerged with intense outbreaks in the Americas since 2013.
- • It is transmitted by *Aedes* mosquitoes, primarily the species *Aedes aegypti,* but sexual transmission and transfusion-related transmission have also occurred.
- • It is often a mild or asymptomatic illness, but infections can manifest with rash, fever, conjunctivitis, and myalgias; severe manifestations have occurred and include Guillain–Barré syndrome (GBS). In utero transmission has led to microcephaly and other severe birth defects.
- • There is no anti-viral agent to treat Zika virus infection; supportive care is indicated.
- • There is no effective vaccine yet; prevention relies on avoidance of vector mosquitoes and sexual contact with infected persons, which are particularly important for pregnant women and persons who are planning conception.

### **INTRODUCTION**

Zika virus, a single-stranded RNA virus of the Flaviviridae family, genus *Flavivirus,* originally isolated in Africa, gained worldwide attention in 2015 and 2016 when massive outbreaks in Brazil were followed by a marked increase in infants born with severe microcephaly and congenital abnormalities. The virus subsequently spread throughout the Americas. Intense research activities have answered key questions about Zika virus, its spread, and control, but gaps in knowledge remain.

### **EPIDEMIOLOGY**

Zika virus, first isolated from a sentinel rhesus monkey in the Zika forest in Uganda in 1947, was found in the same area in 1948 in *Aedes* mosquitoes. The first human infection was identified in the 1950s. In subsequent decades it was identified sporadically in animals and in mild human infections in Africa and Asia. In 2007 Zika virus caused a large outbreak on Yap Island (western Pacific), initially thought to be caused by dengue virus; the virus was estimated to infect 70% of the population.[1](#page--1-0) It subsequently caused a major outbreak in French Polynesia in 2013 to 2014[.2](#page--1-1) Zika virus was first associated with recognized outbreaks in Brazil in 2015, but recent analyses using sequencing, molecular mapping, and modeling suggest Zika reached the Americas as early as 2013, with cryptic transmission before the disease was detected[.3–5](#page--1-3) From northeast Brazil the virus spread to the Caribbean, Central America, and throughout South America (except Chile and Uruguay where local vector transmission has not been documented); many countries in Asia and Africa have also documented transmissio[n6](#page--1-4) ([Fig. 36.3.1](#page-1-0)). Local vector transmission in the continental United States has occurred in Florida and Texas (226 cases as of December 2017; [https://www.cdc.gov/zika\)](https://www.cdc.gov/zika). A 2016 outbreak in Singapore (455 cases confirmed) shows the potential for outbreaks in many tropical and sub-tropical regions where competent mosquito vectors are present and ecoclimatic conditions are favorable[.7](#page--1-2)

# **TRANSMISSION**

Infection is spread primarily via infected female mosquitoes, with *A. aegypti* being the primary vector in the Americas. *A. albopictus,* which can survive in more temperate areas, can also transmit Zika virus. These mosquito vectors infest most sub-tropical and tropical regions globally, including urban areas (areas with a total population of about 3.6 billion people). Seasonality of transmission is linked to local temperature and rainfall patterns. The same mosquitoes can also transmit dengue and chikungunya (and co-transmission can occur). In the past 10 years, Zika transmission has been reported from at least 84 countries.[6](#page--1-4) Zika virus can be transmitted vertically in *A. aegypti* mosquitoes. The transmission cycle in the Americas has been person–mosquito–person. It is not known whether the virus will become established in an animal reservoir host in the Americas, as occurs in Africa, where the virus infected animal hosts and occasionally spilled over into the human population—at least in the past.[8](#page--1-5) The growth of urban areas infested with *A. aegypti* provides a suitable environment for transmission.

Of the 5413 Zika virus disease cases (excluding congenital cases) reported in the United States for January 2015 to December 6, 2017, 95% were travel related and 99% were vector borne. Of the 51 cases that were not vector borne, 94% were attributed to sexual transmission, 1 due to laboratory transmission, and 1 unknown route (<https://www.cdc.gov/zika>).

Virus can be found in blood, urine, saliva, semen, and vaginal or cervical secretions. Sexual transmission can occur during or after symptomatic or asymptomatic infection from male to female, male to male, and female to male (possibly via oral sex)[.9](#page--1-6) Virus is found in vaginal secretions, and viral RNA has been documented in semen up to 188 days after infection and infectious virus up to 69 days. In a longitudinal assessment of Zika virus RNA in body fluids, 95% of men had cleared the virus from semen after about 3 months.[10](#page--1-7) In areas infested with competent vectors, it is difficult to assess what percentage is vector borne and how much infection is sexually transmitted. Zika virus particles and RNA have been found in breast milk, but transmission via breastfeeding has not been documented to date. Virus persists longer in whole blood than in plasma, which may be relevant for diagnosis and in testing blood or tissue donations for transfusion/transplantation. Transmission via platelet transfusion was reported from Brazil,[11](#page--1-8) and RNA Zika–positive asymptomatic donors were identified in Florida and Texas in the United States.[12](#page--1-9) Screening of blood donors in Puerto Rico during an outbreak on the island found 1.1% viremic[.13](#page--1-10)

# **PATHOGENESIS AND PATHOLOGY**

Perinatal transmission of Zika virus was reported to occur in the French Polynesia outbreak in 2013 to 2014, but the association between Zika virus and microcephaly was not recognized until the observations had been made in Brazil and a retrospective study was done in 2016 based on serologic and surveillance data[.14](#page--1-11) Zika virus can infect the placenta, reach the developing fetus, and can target neural precursors. Maternal infection disrupts fetal central nervous system development and causes intrauterine growth retardation and fetal loss. Infection is associated with cortical malformations and intra-cranial calcifications. The congenital malformations include ventriculomegaly, dystrophic calcifications, severe cortical neuronal depletion, decreased brain weight, congenital contractures, marked early hypertonia with symptoms of extrapyramidal involvement, and ocular and hearing problems[.15–17](#page--1-12)

Pathologists also identified pulmonary hypoplasia and pathologic changes consistent with viral infection of multiple organs, including liver and kidneys.[17](#page--1-18) Ongoing follow-up will reveal the extent of other developmental problems.

Based on data from the U.S. territories (2464 live-born infants from completed pregnancies with laboratory evidence of possible Zika virus infection), about 5% had Zika-associated birth defects. The likelihood varied by trimester and was highest during the first trimester (8%, 5%, and 4%, respectively, for first, second, and third trimesters)[.18](#page--1-19)

### **CLINICAL FEATURES**

Zika virus seroprevalence studies in Yap and French Polynesia estimated that asymptomatic infections ranged from 29% to 80%[.1,19](#page--1-0) Clinical syndromes among residents from outbreak areas such as Yap, French Polynesia, Brazil, and Puerto Rico and returned infected travelers appeared to be alik[e1,2,7,20–23](#page--1-0) [\(Table 36.3.1\)](#page-1-1). The most frequently reported symptoms were rash (74%–100%), fever, arthritis and/or arthralgia, myalgia, conjunctivitis, and fatigue. The most common finding, rash, was usually described as

maculopapular.<sup>1,2,7,20–23</sup> Pruritus was reported from Rio de Janeiro, Brazil, and travelers evaluated in the GeoSentinel Surveillance Network, but not from other series.<sup>1,2,7,20–23</sup> Fatigue was frequently reported from French Polynesia and Brazil (78% and 73%, respectively)<sup>2,20</sup> but possibly not solicited or recorded in some other series. Proportions with retro-orbital pain or edema/swelling were variable. Presenting symptoms among children infected postnatally resembled those in adults, mainly with rash, fever, conjunctivitis, and arthralgia.<sup>7,24</sup>

Rarely, some severe complications in adults have been attributed to Zika virus infection, particularly neurologic disorders (GBS, myelitis, demyelinating polyneuropathy, meningoencephalitis), autoimmune disorder, and immune-mediated thrombocytopenia. <sup>23</sup>,25-27 GBS occurred in about 1/4000 Zika infections in studies from French Polynesia and Brazil, at least six times that of the global baseline incidence; males had higher risk. <sup>25,27</sup> Patients with Zika-associated GBS or encephalitis have died (6%), and 51% have chronic pain. <sup>27</sup> As described earlier, congenital Zika syndrome resulting from infection during pregnancy is associated with

devastating abnormalities in the newborn and has the most significant impact.

# PATIENT EVALUATION, DIAGNOSIS, AND DIFFERENTIAL DIAGNOSIS

During acute infection with Zika virus, laboratory findings may reveal leukopenia, lymphopenia, thrombocytopenia, and less frequently, leukocytosis. C-reactive protein may be mildly elevated, as well as transaminases.

Recommendations for confirmatory Zika virus testing vary among countries and have evolved over the course of its rapid spread in the Americas. In the United States testing has been constrained by availability of diagnostic tests and laboratory capability. The guidelines consider the pregnancy status of the patient or partner, exposure history, and symptoms, with strongest focus on pregnant women<sup>28,29</sup> (Fig. 36.3.2).

Definitive Zika diagnosis can be made by detection of viral RNA during acute infection by reverse transcription polymerase

chain reaction (RT-PCR) or other nucleic acid tests (NATs). RNA appears to be detectable longer in whole blood and urine samples compared with serum samples. These molecular tests can be performed on serum, whole blood, or urine up to 2 weeks after symptom onset; in pregnant women, NATs may be performed up to 12 weeks after symptom onset or exposur[e28,29](#page--1-22) (see [Fig. 36.3.2](#page-2-0)).

Detection of Zika IgM by IgM-capture enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (MAC-ELISA) followed by confirmation with plaque reduction neutralization test (PRNT) can also establish the diagnosis. Zika IgM may be reactive when performed 2 to 12 weeks after exposure, but can persist longer. Unfortunately, Zika serology cross-reacts with other flaviviruses, and PRNT, which is needed to differentiate among the flaviviruses, is labor intensive, time consuming, and challenging to interpret. Unlike dengue and chikungunya, where IgG is available to assess past infection and immunity, Zika IgG is not available in the United States.

There are no Food and Drug Administration (FDA)–licensed diagnostic tests for the diagnosis of Zika virus infection, but several diagnostic tests are available under Emergency Use Authorization. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) and state laboratories perform testing with PCR or IgM, and the CDC performs PRNT. In October 2017, the FDA approved the first Zika test for screening blood donations.

The main differential diagnoses for Zika virus infection are other viruses transmitted by *Aedes* mosquitoes, especially dengue (also a flavivirus) and chikungunya (an alphavirus). Because Zika, dengue, and chikungunya cause similar symptoms and each may have important consequences, distinguishing between the three arboviruses by molecular test or serology followed by PRNT is desirable. Other diagnoses that may resemble Zika virus infections include rubeola, rubella, parvovirus, West Nile virus, and many other viruses, as well as leptospirosis, rickettsiosis, and malaria.

### **TREATMENT AND PREVENTION**

Treatment for the typical uncomplicated Zika virus infection aims to provide symptomatic relief. There is no known specific medication targeting Zika virus. However, research is underway to assess the effect of some existing drugs on Zika virus. Preliminary investigations have identified some candidate drugs: emricasan, niclosamide, sofosbuvir, chloroquine, azithromycin, and bovine

<sup>2</sup>Acceptable specimens for NAT testing include serum, or patient-matched serum and urine. Repeat NAT testing of a positive result is not indicated. Dengue and chikungunya virus NAT testing should be performed for patients at risk of exposure, and with clinically compatible illness.

<sup>3</sup>Dengue IgM serology should also be performed for patients at risk of exposure, and with clinically compatible illness.
