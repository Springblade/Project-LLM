## Schistosomiasis

*Bruno Gryseels*

#### KEY FEATURES

- • Schistosomiasis is caused by blood flukes; the most important species are *Schistosoma mansoni, S. haematobium,* and *S. japonicum.*
- • Infection is focally widespread in most of Africa, Southeast Asia, and parts of South America. Up to 200 million people are estimated to be infected; 85% live in sub-Saharan Africa.
- • Schistosome ova are passed in stool or urine; when deposited in freshwater they hatch and release primary larvae, miracidiae, that infect snails.
- • These amplify in the snail and develop into secondary larvae, termed *cercariae,* that leave the snail and penetrate human skin when exposed in freshwater.
- • In endemic areas, large numbers of people can be infected, especially children. Many infections cause no or non-specific disease but can have a hidden morbidity on well-being and school performance.
- • Acute schistosomiasis (Katayama's fever) may occur a few weeks after exposure and is caused by the reaction to migration of developing larvae (schistosomula).
- • Chronic schistosomiasis occurs after years of infection and is caused by cellular immunity and fibrosis in reaction to tissue ova. Ectopic lesions can cause neurologic, pulmonary, or genital schistosomiasis.
- • *S. mansoni* and *S. japonicum* primarily cause intestinal and hepatic pathology; *S. haematobium* primarily damages the urinary tract.
- • Diagnosis is based on microscopic detection of ova, serology, or imaging; molecular diagnosis is useful where available.
- • Praziquantel is safe, inexpensive, and effective oral therapy; light residual infections can persist, and in endemic areas, reinfection is frequent.
- • Mass drug administration with a focus on school children has reduced prevalence and morbidity in many countries. The programs have less impact on transmission and must be regularly repeated.
- • Sanitation and clean water supply remain key to break the transmission cycle.

#### **INTRODUCTION**

Schistosomiasis, a neglected tropical disease (NTD), is caused by trematodes (fluke worms) of the genus *Schistosoma* (Phylum Platyhelminthes, Class Trematoda) that live in blood vessels.[1–4](#page-11-0) Three main species infect humans. *Schistosoma mansoni* and *S. japonicum* cause intestinal and hepatosplenic schistosomiasis; *S. haematobium* causes urinary tract schistosomiasis. Humans become infected when motile larvae, termed *cercariae,* penetrate the skin during freshwater contact [\(Fig. 126.1\)](#page-1-0).

#### **EPIDEMIOLOGY**

The introduction and sustained transmission of *Schistosoma* infections require suitable snail hosts, a tropical climate for at least 4 to 6 months a year, human settlement, and fecal or urinary contamination of surface waters harboring the snails[.1–3,5](#page-11-0) The geographic distribution is largely confined to an area between 36°N and 34°S latitude, where freshwater temperatures average 25°C to 30°C and socioeconomic conditions impose regular contact with snail-infested wate[r1,3,4](#page-11-0) ([Fig. 126.2](#page-2-0)). Within populations and age groups, schistosomes are not evenly distributed—a small number of individuals carry most of the parasite burden.[6](#page-11-1) Although the disease is typically seen in rural areas, it has spread to settlements around artificial dams and irrigated lands, and urban schistosomiasis is becoming an increasing problem. In many shantytowns, snail populations thrive in local canals, drains, or small irrigated plots. As sanitation and water supply are often poor, migration and other exchanges with rural endemic areas leads to the establishment of permanent transmission within city boundaries.

*S. mansoni* occurs in a variety of ecotypes, from savannah, to rainforest, to highland areas up to 2500 m; *S. haematobium* mostly occurs in warm plains. The main foci of *S. mansoni* are in sub-Saharan Africa, including Madagascar, lower and middle Egypt, the Arabian peninsula, northeast Brazil, Surinam, Venezuela, and parts of the Caribbean (see [Fig. 126.2](#page-2-0)). *S. haematobium* occurs in large parts of sub-Saharan Africa, Madagascar, Middle and Upper Egypt, the Maghreb, and the Arabian peninsula. *S. japonicum* is found along the central lakes and the Yangtze River in China, including the mountain areas of Sichuan and Yunnan, as well as Mindanao, Leyte, and other small sites in the Philippines.

*S. intercalatum* is of importance in some pockets in West and Central Africa, *S. mekongi* in the central Mekong basin in Laos and Cambodia, and *S. malayensis* in Malaysia[.1–4](#page-11-0) Each species is transmitted by specific freshwater snails: *Biomphalaria* genus for *S. mansoni, Bulinus* for *S. haematobium,* and *Oncomelania* for *S. japonicum*. [7,8](#page-11-2) A focus of imported transmission has been described on the Mediterranean island of Corsica, raising concern for geographic spread due to migration and climate change[.9](#page-11-3)

There are more than 200 million people in 78 countries estimated to be infected with schistosomiasis by the World Health Organization (WHO).[3,10](#page-11-4) The number of infections and people at risk are declining rapidly in historical foci, such as Egypt, Brazil, and China, as mass drug administration (MDA) reaches many communities and socio-economic conditions improve.[2,10](#page-11-5) Today, over 85% of cases occur in sub-Saharan Africa[.11](#page-11-6)

The epidemiology varies greatly between continents, countries, regions, and neighboring villages. Snail populations, cercarial densities, and human water contact show strong temporal and spatial variations. The prevalence of worms in local populations can commonly be between 30% and 100%, whereas the severity of disease can be uneven. Typically, the highest prevalence and intensity of infection are in children between 8 and 15 years; adults usually have fewer exposures and develop acquired resistance to infection.

<span id="page-1-0"></span>Severe disease is usually associated with heavy worm burdens but may develop after several years of silent or mildly symptomatic infection. Advanced complications can lead to disability and death, with global mortality between 20,000 and 200,000 per year[.10](#page-11-7) Since the advent of safe schistosomicides, especially praziquantel, it is possible to interrupt the disease cycle and to reduce morbidity and mortality, even in the face of continued transmission and re-infection.[11,12](#page-11-6) Modern control strategies focus on regular treatment at the community level, especially school-aged children, through MDA programs.[13](#page-11-8)

Our understanding of the epidemiology of schistosomiasis is based on indirect measures of worm burdens, that is, the presence and number of eggs excreted by individuals in a known volume of excreta.[1,2,6,14](#page-11-0) These are useful at the community and group level but less accurate in individuals due to significant day-to-day and individual variations of egg excretion. The prevalence of infection in endemic communities is usually between 30% and 100%[.1](#page-11-0) However, in areas with low intensities of transmission and infection, many light infections go undetected on screening, and the true prevalence may be two to three times higher than that observed.[15](#page-11-9) In addition, many adults who are negative for ova have probably had earlier infections.

Infections can be detected in toddlers from the age of 6 months onwards—sometimes even earlier[.16](#page-11-10) In almost all foci, prevalence rises strongly from the age of 5 to 7 years to a peak between the age of 8 and 15 years and then declines substantially in adults.[1,2](#page-11-0) In heavily infected communities, the peak age is usually a few years younger. Boys are usually more heavily infected than girls as they play more often and intensively in water.

#### **HISTORY**

Schistosomiasis is an ancient disease; calcified schistosome eggs have been detected in Egyptian, Sudanese, and Chinese mummies dating from several millennia BC. The evolutionary pathway of *S. japonicum* probably lies in the Yangtze River Valley, *S. mansoni* in the Nile River basin, and *S. haematobium* in the African Great Lake area.[1–3,17](#page-11-0) *S. mansoni* was imported to South America with the slave trade in the 16th and 17th centuries.

In 1851, Theodore Bilharz identified *S. haematobium* as the agent of Egyptian endemic hematuria and described the underlying pathology of the urinary system. The term bilharziasis is still used for schistosomal disease. In Egypt in 1904, Symmer described the

typical "clay pipe stem fibrosis" of chronic liver disease. The complete life cycle and the role of the snail intermediate host were described in 1913 by Miyairi.

Exposure of U.S. troops to *S. japonicum* in the Philippines during World War II prompted renewed study of the disease. Over the next few decades the pathogenesis of hepatosplenomegaly, portal hypertension, and esophageal varices was determined. In the 1970s it became understood that chronic disease can take decades to develop and is associated with heavy worm burdens.[18](#page-11-11)

The development of praziquantel in 1979 was a breakthrough for treatment and control[.1,19](#page-11-0) It is highly effective and safe against all species in a single dose. Generic brands of praziquantel, drug donations, and international support for NTD control enabled the introduction of MDA, often combined with other antihelminthics, for the control of schistosomal morbidity. In 2001 the World Health Assembly recommended MDA in regions where schistosomiasis constitutes a serious public health problem, with integrated case management, health education, safe water supply, and improved sanitation[.20](#page-11-12)

#### **NATURAL HISTORY, PATHOGENESIS, AND PATHOLOGY**

*Schistosoma* worms differ from other human flukes by (1) having separate sexes, (2) living in blood vessels, (3) having non-operculated eggs, and (4) lacking an encysted metacercarial stage. Humans are definitive hosts for *S. japonicum, S. mansoni, S. haematobium, S. mekongi, S. malayensis,* and *S. intercalatum*.

Dozens of other schistosome species infect animals.[21](#page-11-13) Cercariae of non-human schistosomes, mostly parasites of birds or small mammals, can penetrate human skin, causing dermatitis, but die without migration or maturation. These exposures can cause "swimmer's itch" during summers in North America and Europe.[22](#page-11-14)

Adult schistosomes are white-grayish worms with a cylindrical body that is 10 to 20 mm long and 0.3 to 0.6 mm thick [\(Fig.](#page-3-0) [126.3](#page-3-0)). The tegument of adult worms is a double layer; the outer one is continuously shed and renewed. The adult male is shorter, thicker, and flatter than the longer, slender female. With his flattened body, the male worm forms a groove, or "gynecophoric channel," in which the female positions herself for most of her life and where copulation takes place.

Schistosomes feed on nutrients and cells in the blood; debris is regurgitated into the host's bloodstream. The pigment can be deposited in the Kupffer cells and macrophages of the liver and other organs, showing as typical pigmentation in histologic stains.

Adult schistosome pairs live within the venous plexus of their target organs (see [Fig. 126.1](#page-1-0)). For *S. haematobium* these are the perivesical and ureteral vessels, for *S. mansoni* the inferior mesenteric vessels of the large intestine, and for *S. japonicum* the superior mesenteric vessels of the large and small intestine. Live eggs can be found for more than 30 years after last exposure[.23](#page-11-15) The average lifespan of adult schistosomes is estimated at 3 to 5 years but may be shorter in areas with high levels of transmission and worm turnover.[24](#page-11-16)

The eggs are large, oval or round, 100 to 170 µm in length, and with a typical terminal or lateral spine, and are deposited at a daily rate of hundreds (African species) to several thousands (Oriental species) [\(Fig. 126.4\)](#page-3-1). Each ovum contains one ciliated larva, called a *miracidium,* which matures over 6 to 10 days. The miracidium secretes proteolytic enzymes that help eggs to penetrate through the vascular wall and into surrounding tissues, into the lumen of the bladder or the intestine. About 50% of the eggs are excreted with the urine or the feces, where they may stay viable for 7 days (African species) or up to several months (Oriental species), depending on temperature and humidity. The other ova can remain stuck in the tissues of the bladder or ureters, the intestinal wall, or the liver or spleen, where immune responses lead to most of the host's pathology.

The miracidium is released upon contact with water of the right temperature (20°C–30°C) and swims in search of its snail intermediate host. Miracidia can remain infective for 6 to 12 hours. The snail intermediate hosts for *S. haematobium* and *S. intercalatum* are *Bulinidae.* The genus *Biomphalaria* serves as the intermediate host for *S. mansoni*. [1,7,8](#page-11-0) The snail hosts of *S. japonicum* are members of the amphibious *Oncomelania hupensis* species. Less than 0.5% of the snail population is infected with schistosomes at any one time[.14](#page-11-9)

After snail penetration, miracidia lose their cilia and develop into bifurcated, mobile larvae called *cercariae*. Reproduction in the snail takes 4 to 6 weeks, but cercariae can be shed for up to 3 months at a rate of dozens (*S. japonicum*) to thousands (*S. mansoni, S. haematobium*) per day. A single snail can produce up to 100,000 cercariae in its lifetime.

Cercariae measure 400 to 600 µm in length. They feature a pear-shaped head with two suckers and a long slender tail ending in a short fork. Cercariae can survive up to 48 to 72 hours, though infectivity starts to decrease after 12 hours. When they meet a suitable definitive host, they attach themselves to its skin by their suckers. Vertical, vibratory movements and lytic secretions lead to penetration of the skin, usually within 3 to 5 minutes. Cercariae lose their tail and undergo outer membrane modification to become schistosomula that are tolerant of a saline environment and to part of the host's immune responses. They remain in subcutaneous tissue for about 48 hours before beginning the 3- to 6-day migration through the bloodstream to the heart and then the lungs. Within 5 to 10 days they reach the small vessels of the liver, where they mature within another 3 to 4 weeks into adult male or female worms, mate, and migrate against the blood flow to their perivesicular or mesenteric destination, where the cycle repeats itself. Egg deposition and excretion start 6 to 8 weeks after infection.

Humans are the main reservoir for *S. haematobium* and *S. mansoni*. [9,21](#page-11-3) In contrast, *S. japonicum* is a zoonotic parasite that naturally infects dogs, cats, cattle, water buffaloes, pigs, horses, sheep, goats, and rodents; some of these (i.e., cattle and water buffaloes) are as important for transmission as humans[.8,14](#page-11-17)

#### **IMMUNOLOGY**

People living in endemic areas develop acquired immunity, but only after several years of exposure[.25](#page-11-18) Prevalence and intensity of infection decline after the age of 10 to 15 years. The partial immunity is mediated by IgE against larval and adult worm antigens, which stimulate eosinophils to release cytotoxins targeting schistosomulae.[26,27](#page-11-19) Efforts to develop a protective vaccine are ongoing but are unlikely to result in a commercially available product in the near future.[3,27,28](#page-11-4)

The main pathology in schistosomiasis is caused by cellular immune responses against eggs retained in the tissues, rather than to adult worms[.18,29,30](#page-11-11) The enzymes and metabolites released by the ova that are trapped in the tissues provoke granulomatous reactions by neutrophils, eosinophils, monocytes, and lymphocytes orchestrated by CD4+ T cells [\(Fig. 126.5A and B\)](#page-4-0). In the early stages of infection, cytokine responses are predominantly of the TH1 type featuring interferon-γ. As egg production proceeds, they shift to a TH2 profile with high levels of IgE, interleukin (IL)-4, and eosinophilia. In long-standing chronic infection, this TH2 profile modulates to production of IL-10, IL-13, and IgG4, which leads to the regression of the granulomas and their replacement by collagen. In most infected persons, however, antiinflammatory IL-10, and possibly transforming growth factor (TGF)-β, induced by regulatory T cells, prevents excessive TH1 or TH2 polarization.

Epidemiologic studies suggest that infection with *S. haematobium* and *S. mansoni* increases susceptibility to infection with HIV-1 in females, due to mucosal lesions in the urogenital areas.[3,31,32](#page-11-4) Treatment of concomitant schistosomiasis appears to have little effect on HIV viral load. Reduced CD4+ T-cell counts may increase the susceptibility to schistosome infections and affect the reliability of serodiagnosis. It is not clear if chronic schistosomiasis, by downregulating the TH1 and upregulating the TH2 immune responses, could allow viral infections, notably hepatitis B and C, to become chronic and more severe.[33](#page-12-0)

#### **CLINICAL FEATURES**

The pathogenesis of schistosomiasis is largely based upon the host reaction against the parasite. Adult worms living in the bloodstream are seldom associated with clinical illness.

#### **Cercarial Dermatitis**

Non-sensitized and sensitized individuals respond differently to penetration of the skin by cercariae. Initial exposures produce only mild, transient reactions that can go unnoticed or cause only a mild prickling sensation. Macules usually appear within 12 hours

In previously sensitized persons they are followed by pruritic papules, erythema, and, rarely, vesicles and edema [\(Fig. 126.6](#page-4-1)). Cercarial dermatitis most commonly occurs with *S. mansoni* and *S. haematobium* and is unusual with *S. japonicum.* A similar "swimmer's itch" is caused by cercariae of animal and bird trematodes in tropical areas or during summer in temperate climate zones, including Europe and North America.[1,22](#page-11-0) Cercarial dermatitis resolves in 7 to 10 days without permanent tissue damage or scarring.

#### **Acute Schistosomiasis (Katayama's Fever)**

Acute schistosomiasis, or "Katayama's fever" (its historical Japanese name), is a systemic hypersensitivity reaction to migrating schistosomulae and/or the onset of egg production, occurring within a few weeks to months after a primary infection.[34,35](#page-12-1) The onset is usually sudden with fever, fatigue, myalgia, malaise, non-productive cough, marked peripheral eosinophilia, elevated IgE, and patchy infiltrates on chest x-ray. Early symptoms are mostly caused by allergic reactions to migratory schistosomulae in the pulmonary microvasculature. A few weeks later, abdominal symptoms may develop because of worm migration and the start of ovideposition in the tissues. Most patients recover spontaneously after 2 to 10 weeks, but some develop a persistent, serious illness with weight loss, dyspnea, diarrhea, diffuse abdominal pain, toxemia, hepatosplenomegaly, and generalized rash.

Acute schistosomiasis caused by *S. mansoni* and *S. haematobium* is rarely reported in chronically exposed populations; however, it is regularly diagnosed in tourists and travelers. Most cases in returned travelers are from sub-Saharan Africa and can occur in family or group clusters[.34,36](#page-12-1) Exposures have occurred in Lakes Malawi, Victoria, and Volta; the Zambesi and Niger deltas; the Dogon country of Mali; and lake resorts in South Africa. Serious neurologic complications can occur as a result of ectopic worms or eggs in the spinal cord.

Katayama's fever caused by *S. japonicum* infections is more common and can be a serious, sometimes fatal, serum sickness–like disease. It may result from the early release of large quantities of egg antigens that react with antibody, resulting in immune complexes causing hypertrophy of lymphoreticular tissue.[1–3,35](#page-11-0) This prototypic Katayama's syndrome is characterized by fever, hepatosplenomegaly, and cachexia, which can evolve directly to severe hepatosplenic fibrosis and portal hypertension, even leading to death. Unlike African schistosomiasis, it is not restricted to primary infection, but occurs in people living in endemic areas and in those with a history of previous infections.

#### **Chronic Pathology and Illness**

Most pathology is caused by chronic cellular and fibrotic immune reactions against eggs that are trapped in the tissues during their perivesical or peri-intestinal migration, or after embolization to the liver, spleen, lungs, or cerebrospinal system.[17,37,38](#page-11-20) The ova secrete proteolytic enzymes that sensitize local lymphocytes that mobilize macrophages, lymphocytes, eosinophils, and fibroblasts to encapsulate the egg within a granuloma (see [Fig. 126.5\)](#page-4-0).

The egg granuloma can be protective as well as pathogenic. In healthy hosts it reduces or confines tissue necrosis. As cell-mediated immunity reactions are downregulated over time, granulomas reduce in size and are gradually replaced by collagen depositions that in some patients can lead to fibrosis. Many microlesions can merge into the typical fibrotic streaks that cause most of the irreversible pathology. Therefore the severity of chronic disease is related to the intensity of infection and individual immune responses, with severe schistosomiasis seen in individuals with previously high parasite loads and immunogenetic predisposition.[3,29,30](#page-11-4)

Many infections are asymptomatic or cause mild, vague, or intermittent symptoms of malaise, drowsiness, abdominal discomfort, and mucus or blood-specked diarrhea[.1–3](#page-11-0) In endemic areas, it is common to detect many infected persons without noticeable consequences. However, treatment may be followed by reports of improved well-being, fitness, and appetite. In tourists or migrants, infection can be a chance finding, sometimes decades after exposure.

#### **Urinary Schistosomiasis**

The eggs of *S. haematobium* provoke granulomatous inflammation, ulceration, and pseudopolyposis of the mucosa and submucosa of the bladder and the ureters.[1–3,39](#page-11-0) Obstructive uropathy occurs when lesions are in the ureter or the bladder near the ureteral inlet. Bladder and ureteral obstruction can result in urine stasis and infection. Abdominal x-rays may show calcium deposits around *Schistosoma* eggs in the bladder wall.

Common early symptoms are dysuria, urinary frequency and urgency, proteinuria, and hematuria. In endemic areas, the latter is the "red flag of schistosomiasis" in children aged 5 to 10 years old, sometimes mistakenly considered as the onset of menstruation in girls ([Fig. 126.7](#page-5-0)). Typically, blood is first seen in the terminal urine; in more severe cases, the urine can be dark-colored with bacterial super-infection. These symptoms wane as the child becomes older. In untreated populations*,* microhematuria can be present in 40% to 100% of infected children[.40](#page-12-2) Bladder pathology and upper urinary tract lesions can be detected by ultrasound or radiology ([Figs. 126.8](#page-5-1) and [126.9](#page-5-2)). Many cases show preserved renal function. Lesions can reverse spontaneously with age and usually heal after anti-schistosomal therapy. Chronic infection can lead to obstructive uropathy, renal failure, and bladder cancer. Advanced cases have become relatively rare after widespread use of praziquantel.

#### Bladder Cancer

Chronic urinary schistosomiasis is epidemiologically associated with a high incidence of squamous cell bladder carcinoma in Egypt and, less clearly, in other African foci.[3,41](#page-11-4) In Egypt, the incidence of bladder cancer has decreased dramatically over the past 2 to 3 decades as the prevalence of urinary disease has declined. In addition to chronic inflammation of the bladder wall, schistosomal lesions may enhance exposure of the bladder epithelium to carcinogenic substrates; tobacco as well as paint substances have been invoked as co-factors[.2](#page-11-5) Apart from gross hematuria, bladder cancer often presents with frequency, urgency, dysuria, weight loss, and metastasis to the inguinal, femoral, and retroperitoneal lymph nodes.

#### **Intestinal Schistosomiasis**

The eggs of *S. mansoni, S. japonicum,* and other species migrate through the intestinal wall and provoke mucosal granulomatous inflammation, pseudo-polyposis, micro-ulcerations, and superficial bleeding. Most lesions are situated in the large bowel and the rectum; small bowel pathology is rare[.42](#page-12-3)

The most common symptoms are chronic or intermittent abdominal pain and discomfort, loss of appetite, and mucous

diarrhea with or without gross blood; occult blood is common[.1–3,40](#page-11-0) Physical examination can be normal or show moderate abdominal distention, diffuse mild abdominal tenderness, and hyperactive bowel sounds.

Intestinal polyposis, ulcers, fistula, and strictures have been attributed to *S. mansoni.* In such cases, diffuse, protein-losing enteropathy can occur, with chronic mucohemorrhagic diarrhea, weight loss, and anemia. Physical examination reveals a distended abdomen with diffuse or localized tenderness over the transverse and descending colon. Severe, long-standing granulomatous or polypous lesions can result in partial or complete bowel obstruction and, in rare cases, appendicitis or perforation. Intense dysenteric syndromes are exceptional, but in some cases fatal. *S. japonicum* and *S. mansoni* have been associated with colon cancer, but the evidence for causation is weak.

The reported frequency of intestinal disease in people living in endemic areas infected with *S. mansoni* or *S. japonicum* is usually 10% to 50%[.40](#page-12-2) In general, intestinal morbidity is strongly correlated with intensities of infection, both at the population and at the individual level.

#### **Hepatosplenic Schistosomiasis**

Hepatic schistosomiasis [\(Figs. 126.10](#page-6-0) and [126.11\)](#page-6-1) can be caused by *S. mansoni, S. japonicum,* and *S. mekongi.* It can be due to either early inflammatory or late fibrotic hepatic disease, with quite different underlying pathologies and prognoses.[1–3](#page-11-0)

#### Inflammatory Hepatic Schistosomiasis

This is an early reaction to ova trapped in the hepatic pre-sinusoidal periportal spaces where many granulomas are produced (see [Fig.](#page-4-0) [126.5A](#page-4-0)). It is the main cause of schistosomal hepatomegaly in children and adolescents, often associated with hyperplastic splenomegaly and strongly correlated with the intensity of infection and immunogenetic predisposition[.40](#page-12-2) Features include sharp-edged enlargement of the left lobe of the liver and nodular splenomegaly. In most cases, the organomegaly is mild, but sometimes the liver

and spleen can extend below the umbilicus and into the pelvis ([Fig. 126.10A\)](#page-6-0). Usually, liver cell function is preserved and jaundice is absent. In heavily endemic areas, hepatomegaly, with or without splenomegaly, is present in 30% or more of infected children and adolescents, but much less in adults.

#### Fibrotic or Chronic Hepatic Schistosomiasis

This complication develops years into the course in a minority of those infected. It is thought to be a consequence of long-standing intense infection, as well as immune responses that fail to downregulate granulomatous and fibrotic reactions.[29,30](#page-11-21) Diffuse collagen deposits in the periportal spaces (see [Fig. 126.5B\)](#page-4-0) lead to the pathognomic "Symmer's pipe stem fibrosis," in which the elongated periportal fibrotic lesions resemble clay pipe stems [\(Fig. 126.11](#page-6-1)). Physical occlusion of the portal veins leads to portal hypertension, increased splenic vein pressure, and tortuosity and splenomegaly. Portal hypertension results in collateralization of the abdominal venous circulation that can present as a "caput medusa" and leads internally to portocaval shunting and gastrointestinal varices. This condition also facilitates the distribution of *Schistosoma* eggs into the general circulation and to ectopic lesions in the lungs, spinal cord, or the brain. End-stage hepatosplenic schistosomiasis can be marked by ascites (see [Fig. 126.10B](#page-6-0)).

The liver may be normal sized, but is usually hard and nodular on palpation. In contrast to cirrhosis, the parenchyma, hepatocellular functions, and their biologic parameters remain largely unaffected. Fibrotic hepatic schistosomiasis is mainly seen in young and middle-aged adults, although it can occur in heavily infected adolescents. In *S. mansoni,* this takes at least 5 to 15 years to develop, by which time ova may not be present. In *S. japonicum,* the progression can be more rapid, in some cases with little or no interval between acute and chronic disease.

Bleeding from gastroesophageal varices is the most serious, and often fatal, complication of fibrotic hepatic schistosomiasis. In *S. mansoni* infections, it tends to recur and become more severe over time; in *S. japonicum,* bleeding is often sudden and massive. Repeated or occult bleeding can lead to anemia, hypoalbuminemia, cachexia, and growth retardation. Ascites can be caused by a combination of hypoalbuminemia and portal hypertension or concomitant infection with hepatitis B or C.

Advanced liver fibrosis caused by schistosomiasis used to be a frequent and severe health problem in large parts of Egypt, Brazil, China, the Philippines, and other countries. Chemotherapy and

socioeconomic development have led to a dramatic reduction of such morbidity. Symptomatic liver fibrosis has always been less frequent in sub-Saharan Africa, except for some East African foci, for example West Nile in Uganda, Machakos in Kenya, and Gezirah in Sudan[.40](#page-12-2)

#### **Other Complications and Ectopic Schistosomiasis**

#### Pulmonary Schistosomiasis

This syndrome is a complication of portocaval shunting caused by portal hypertension in chronic *S. mansoni* infection allowing ova to pass into the peri-alveolar capillary beds.[1,2,43](#page-11-0) The granulomas cause obliterative arteritis, which leads to fibrosis resulting in pulmonary hypertension, increased right heart pressure, pulmonary artery and right atrial dilatation, and right ventricular hypertrophy. Schistosomal cor pulmonale has been mostly described in Brazil and Egypt but has become much less frequent.

#### Schistosomal Glomerulonephritis

Immune complexes can be deposited in the renal glomeruli with *S. mansoni* infection.[44](#page-12-4) This glomerulonephritis was usually asymptomatic or clinically insignificant. Nephrotic syndrome is seen occasionally in patients with *S. mansoni* or *S. haematobium* infections and is sometimes associated with chronic *Salmonella* bacteremia or bacteriuria.

#### Genital Schistosomiasis

*S. haematobium* and *S. mansoni* ova that are trapped in the reproductive organs remain mostly occult in endemic areas but are a clinical finding in travelers. Hypertrophic and ulcerative lesions of the vulva, vagina, and cervix can facilitate the transmission of sexually transmitted infections, including HIV[.31,32](#page-12-5) Lesions of the ovaries and the fallopian tubes can lead to infertility. In males, the epididymis, testicles, spermatic cord, and prostate can be affected; hemospermia is common.[45](#page-12-6)

#### Neuroschistosomiasis

This severe complication is caused by inflammation around ectopic worms or eggs in the cerebral or spinal venous plexus and can evolve to irreversible fibrotic scars if untreated.[1–3,46](#page-11-0) Ectopic *S. mansoni* and *S. haematobium* mainly cause spinal cord pathology with transverse myelitis, a potential complication of acute schistosomiasis in travelers[.34](#page-12-1) Symptoms can include paraplegia and loss of bladder and/or anal sphincter control. Sometimes, the patient may have pain or loss of sensation.

*S. japonicum,* possibly because of the larger number and smaller sized eggs, is associated with diffuse or focal cerebral granulomatous lesions. The resulting syndrome can be epileptic, paralytic, or meningo-encephalitic. The acute phase, which occurs months after exposure, may be accompanied by fever, urticaria, eosinophilia, and angioneurotic edema, suggesting an allergic encephalopathy. There can be delirium, confusion, personality changes, incontinence, coma, nuchal rigidity, pyramidal track signs, and cerebellar symptoms. The acute phase can merge into a chronic phase that can be asymptomatic or mimic intracranial neoplasm. Other neurologic signs and symptoms are headaches, speech difficulties, visual disturbances, papilledema, and cerebellar symptoms.[46](#page-12-7)

#### Other Sites

Ectopic schistosomal skin lesions can present as maculopapules or wartlike protuberances, the latter particularly in the genital area[.2](#page-11-5) Schistosomal granulomas in the peritoneum can be mistaken for endometriosis, miliary tuberculosis, or cancer metastasis.

#### **Association of Schistosomiasis and Other Infections**

#### Chronic *Salmonella* Co-Infections

Schistosomiasis has been associated with several co-infections, especially chronic persistent *Salmonella* bacteremia.[1,47](#page-11-0) Explanations include immunologic tolerance caused by schistosoma and the attachment and proliferation of *Salmonella* bacteria on or in adult worms. The clinical syndrome was mainly in males between the age of 15 and 30 years but has become rare. It is characterized by a long history of indolent febrile disease, bacteremia with one or more *Salmonella* species, and chronic active schistosomiasis. The interaction has regained attention because of the evolution of *Salmonella* and their resistance to antibiotics in Africa.[47](#page-12-8)

#### Co-Infections With Hepatitis B and C

Chronic *S. mansoni*–infected patients co-infected with hepatitis B or C are prone to have more severe infections. Contaminated parenteral treatment for schistosomiasis may also have increased the risk for hepatitis infections in some areas, especially Egypt.[33,48](#page-12-0) Patients with co-infections more often develop jaundice, intractable ascites, and hepatic failure. Patients with schistosomiasis who have elevated serum alanine transaminase (ALT) or aspartate transaminase (AST) have a high probability of concomitant hepatitis B and/or C infections.

#### **Indirect Pathology and Morbidity**

Historically, *S. japonicum* infection was believed to contribute to reduced stature, weight, weight-for-height, skinfold thickness, muscle mass, and other anthropometric measures, especially during childhood and adolescence. These observations, although not always rigorously documented, suggested an effect of infection on nutrition, growth, and development.

Early studies to establish this effect for *S. mansoni* or *S. haematobium* infection were largely inconclusive.[40](#page-12-2) Possibly, they were obscured by the frequent comorbidities from other tropical infections. As severe disease from *Schistosoma* infections has waned, research into subtle or "indirect" morbidity has demonstrated associations with anemia, nutritional status, and cognitive and physiologic capacities.[49–51](#page-12-9)

#### **GLOBAL BURDEN OF DISEASE**

Schistosomiasis is highly prevalent, but the associated morbidity is variable. The global burden of disease (GBD) of schistosomiasis in 2006, as expressed in disability-adjusted life years (DALY), was estimated at 1.75 to 2.0 million, of which 85% was in sub-Saharan Africa[.52](#page-12-10) The global number of cases was estimated by the WHO at 206 million[,2,10,11](#page-11-5) and the original GBD estimates reported up to 15,000 lives lost annually. This is a fraction of the GBD of AIDS, malaria, or tuberculosis, and is similar to lymphatic filariasis, leishmaniasis, and trypanosomiasis. A recent update of the GBD indicates a reduction of morbidity due to schistosomiasis.[53](#page-12-11) Despite these data, treatment and control of disease in affected populations need to be continued.[11,51,53–55](#page-11-6)

#### **DIAGNOSIS**

#### **Medical History and Examination**

Schistosomiasis should be suspected in patients presenting with a compatible clinical history and exposure.[34,36](#page-12-1) The patient may have intermittent symptoms, including swimmer's itch and flulike illness, in the weeks or months after exposure. A neurologic history and examination should be performed to exclude cerebrospinal involvement. Abdominal palpation may reveal hepatomegaly or splenomegaly and abdominal tenderness or distention but can be negative.

#### **Laboratory Findings**

Rapid tests that can be used in community screenings include a visual inspection of urine or a hematuria dip-stick test for suspected *S. haematobium,* and occult blood in the stools for *S. mansoni* and *S. japonicum*. [1–3,40](#page-11-0) In tourists and migrants, the most important hematologic indicator is eosinophilia, which is usually elevated in acute schistosomiasis but may be negative in chronic cases. Liver function tests are most often within normal limits; if elevated, a concomitant hepatitis B and/or C infection should be suspected. More recent tools for the diagnosis of schistosomiasis, including antigen detection and polymerase chain reaction (PCR), are confined to research settings or reference laboratories[.56](#page-12-12)

#### *Schistosoma* **Ova Identification by Microscopy**

Microscopic identification of eggs in excreta remains the gold standard for the diagnosis of active schistosomiasis but has low sensitivity in light infections[15](#page-11-22) (see [Fig. 126.4](#page-3-1)). Concentration methods and repeated examinations using different urine or stool specimens on different days may be required[.1,57,58](#page-11-0) Incidental exposure may lead to infection with only male or female worms, in which case there is no ova production and serology may be positive. If eggs are found, their size and shape allow easy detection and identification under low magnification. The microscopic examination of crushed rectal snips, obtained during proctoscopy or sigmoidoscopy, is sensitive for *S. mansoni* and *S. japonicum,* as well as *S. haematobium* infection.

Quantitative egg counts after standardized urine filtration or in calibrated fecal thick smears (Kato–Katz method) are useful for epidemiologic surveys and control, as they correlate reasonably well with worm burdens and morbidity[.1,57,58](#page-11-0) When accuracy is required, three to five repeated examinations with Kato–Katz or 10 mL urine filtration may be needed.

Verifying the ova's viability can be useful to determine whether treatment has been successful. Viable eggs will reveal clear, transparent structures with moving organelles (flame cells) of the miracidium. Dead eggs, which may be excreted for months after successful treatment, are often deformed, dark or half-empty, and show no internal movement.

#### **Serology and Antigen Detection**

Many sensitive serologic methods have been developed for the indirect diagnosis of schistosomiasis[.26,56,59](#page-11-19) These cannot distinguish a past infection from a current active one and can cross-react with other helminths. They are not easily applicable in the field but are important for diagnosis in travelers, migrants, and other occasionally exposed people, even when urine and stools are microscopically negative. Most techniques detect IgG, IgM, or IgE against soluble worm antigen (SWA) or crude egg antigen (CEA) by enzyme immunoassays (EIAs). Seroconversion usually occurs within 4 to 8 weeks after infection, but, rarely, antibodies might not be detected for 4 to 5 months after infection. Most assays remain positive for at least 2 years after cure, and often much longer.

Circulating anodic antigen (CAA) and circulating cathodic antigen (CCA) can be detected and quantified in serum or urine with labeled monoclonal antibodies[.58,60,61](#page-12-13) These are *Schistosoma* gut glycoproteins regurgitated with the metabolized blood particles into the circulation of the human host. Antigen detection in serum is not sensitive in light infections and therefore has limited clinical application. These assays are primarily used in epidemiologic and therapeutic studies. Urine-based assays, one of which has been marketed as a point-of care kit, are more sensitive but less specific[.62](#page-12-14)

#### **OTHER TESTING**

Reagent strips for hematuria and questionnaires for visible hematuria are inexpensive, easy, and effective for screening and rapid assessment of urinary schistosomiasis[.1–3,15,57,58](#page-11-0) Indirect diagnostic methods for intestinal or hepatic schistosomiasis, for example, examining the stool for mucus and blood, are reasonably sensitive but less specific.

#### **Endoscopy and Cystoscopy**

Endoscopy can visualize esophageal varices; sigmoidoscopy and colonoscopy allow visualization of schistosomiasis lesions and access to biopsy for tissue egg identification[.1,63](#page-11-0) Laparoscopy can reveal granulomatous inflammation or periportal fibrosis. Needle biopsies of the liver may not be sufficient to sample the hard fibrotic lesions; wedge biopsies may be needed to differentiate periportal fibrosis from post-infectious or alcoholic cirrhosis. Cystoscopy can reveal hemorrhagic inflammation, granulomatosis, polyposis, fibrosis, or calcification of the bladder and allow biopsy.

#### **Imaging**

Intravenous pyelography and ultrasonography can visualize renal, ureteral, and bladder pathology, and plain x-rays show calcified tissue, including renal or bladder stones (see [Figs. 126.8](#page-5-1) and [126.9\)](#page-5-2).[64](#page-12-15) In hepatic schistosomiasis, contrast radiology can demonstrate portal vein distension or gastroesophageal varices. Computerized tomography, myelography, and magnetic resonance can be useful for detailed imaging, especially for neuroschistosomiasis.

Ultrasonography has provided marked improvement in the diagnosis and study of pathology[.65,66](#page-12-16) It is an excellent non-invasive technique to demonstrate periportal fibrosis and can estimate the degree of portal hypertension by measuring the distension of the portal vein ([Fig. 126.12\)](#page-9-0). Standardized protocols can classify hepatic fibrosis and urinary tract lesions. These require specific expertise and experience, and results may be subject to inter- and intraobserver variation.

#### **TREATMENT**

Once parasitologic or clinical diagnosis of schistosomiasis is confirmed, treatment is almost always indicated.

#### **Chemotherapeutic Agents**

Praziquantel (Biltricide, Bayer) is the drug of choice. It is effective against all schistosome species, as well as other flukes (e.g., *Clonorchis sinensis* and *Paragonimus westermani*) and cestodes (e.g., *Taenia saginata, T. solium, Diphyllobothrium latum,* and *Hymenolepis nana*).[2,3,10,63,67,68](#page-11-5) An older drug, oxamniquine, is also effective in an oral single dose but works only against *S. mansoni* and is only used in Brazil.[67](#page-12-17)

Praziquantel acts within an hour of ingestion by provoking tetanic contraction of adult worms and damaging their tegument; the precise mechanisms remain unknown. Humoral and cellular immune responses are targeted toward exposed schistosoma antigens, enhancing the drug effect. Side effects are mild and include nausea, vomiting, malaise, and abdominal pain. In heavy infections, acute colic with bloody diarrhea may occur, probably provoked by antigen release.

There are dozens of generic brands of praziquantel, not all of which are of trustworthy quality.[69](#page-12-18) The reduction of the price from \$2.00 to 4.00/treatment to less than \$0.20, as well as drug

donations, has made praziquantel widely available for control. After 30 years of widespread use, no significant safety problems have been documented in humans, including young children and pregnant women[.70](#page-12-19)

The standard single dose of 40 mg/kg of body weight for treating *S. mansoni, S. haematobium,* or *S. intercalatum* may not be curative[.1–3,63](#page-11-0) Because higher-dose regimens are not always well tolerated, they should be given in split doses, several hours apart. For population-based treatment, in which the reduction of egg loads and morbidity is the main objective, 40 mg/kg remains recommended[.10,12](#page-11-7) People with high egg counts may be given two doses of 30 mg/kg, 3 to 6 hours apart. This higher split dose is also routinely recommended for treatment of *S. japonicum, S. mekongi,* and *S. malayensis.*

Praziquantel does not act on ova or immature worms. Viable, tissue-dwelling eggs may be excreted for several weeks after treatment, and schistosomulae or young adult worms can survive to become viable adults. The optimal course, particularly in travelers or migrants no longer residing in endemic areas in whom complete cure is the goal, is to perform the microscopic examination of the stool and/or urine, and possible rectal or bladder biopsy, 4 to 6 weeks after treatment and to repeat praziquantel administration if needed. In such cases, the split dose of 60 mg/kg can be considered. Persisting eosinophilia can indicate the need for retreatment, although other causes should be explored.

After a single dose of 40 mg/kg, intensity of infection, as measured by egg counts or antigen levels, is reduced by 90% to 95%, with parasitologic cure in 70% to 95% of treated patients. These percentages may be lower in populations with high initial egg counts and who are exposed to intense transmission and reinfection.[71](#page-12-20)

Most schistosome-induced pathology resolves after praziquantel treatment.[72,73](#page-12-21) Clinical, radiologic, and sonographic studies have demonstrated regression over weeks to months of intestinal and vesical lesions, reactive hepatomegaly, and even severe upper urinary tract lesions and liver fibrosis. Thus the prognosis is usually good, except in advanced cases with parenchymal hydronephrosis or renal failure in urinary schistosomiasis, or severe liver fibrosis with established portal hypertension with recurrent bleeding from esophageal varices and ascites in hepatosplenic schistosomiasis.

To date, true drug resistance to praziquantel has not been convincingly demonstrated; treatment failures in high-foci areas are caused by ongoing intense transmission[.71,74](#page-12-20) With wide use of MDA, development of resistance needs to be monitored.

Derivatives of artemisinin, a drug for the treatment of malaria, were shown to be effective against the immature stages of *S. japonicum, S. mansoni,* and possibly *S. haematobium*. [75,76](#page-12-22) They could be used to treat acute schistosomiasis or as a prophylactic agent. In a clinical trial in China, repeated administration throughout the transmission season greatly reduced the parasite burden of *S. japonicum* and prevented early manifestations of infection. Trials in Africa, as a stand-alone drug or in combination with praziquantel, showed prophylactic but not curative potential. This preventive approach is not recommended, as artemisinin should be reserved for treatment of drug-resistant malaria.

#### **Treatment of Acute Schistosomiasis and Complications**

Topical steroids and oral antihistamines can provide symptomatic relief for cercarial dermatitis. Katayama's fever is primarily treated with corticosteroids, for example, prednisone 40 mg daily for 5 to 14 days, to suppress the hypersensitivity reaction. This should be followed by praziquantel to eliminate adult worms.[34,35,63](#page-12-1)

Neuroschistosomiasis requires specialized care, again with corticosteroids and, if necessary, anticonvulsants before praziquantel treatment.[46,63](#page-12-7) Caution is required in the rare case of concurrent neurocysticercosis, for which praziquantel is also active but may provoke epileptic seizures due to the destruction of the cerebral cysts.

Bleeding from esophageal varices may be treated symptomatically with β-blockers, endoscopic sclerotherapy, splenectomy, or splenorenal or portocaval shunts. In advanced urinary schistosomiasis, destroyed and non-functional kidneys may have to be removed.[63](#page-12-23)

#### **CONTROL AND PREVENTION**

Large-scale national control programs for schistosomiasis, based on destruction of the snail intermediate hosts, case finding, and improved hygiene, were a public health priority in Egypt, the Maghreb, Brazil, China, and the Philippines until the late 20th century[.1–3,17,31](#page-11-0) Most lower-income endemic countries, especially in sub-Saharan Africa, were devoid of such efforts and often lacked the means to diagnose and treat clinical cases. Over the past decade, however, WHO strategy, drug donations, and efforts to eliminate NTDs have led to extensive MDA.[77](#page-12-24)

Attempts to exterminate snail populations with molluscicides are expensive and logistically demanding, and although populations can be reduced, they are rarely exterminated[.1,2](#page-11-0) Focal application in specific "hot spots" may be useful in preventing local infections; however, chemical snail control has been all but abandoned as a control strategy.

The introduction of praziquantel heralded a shift in control strategies to interventions aimed at the definitive human host. This strategy of "morbidity control" through mass drug treatment has an impact on infection and disease by reducing the prevalence and intensity of community wide infection. Over time this approach should lead to decreased transmission, although this is difficult to measure. Since adoption by the WHO in 2002 it has become the standard approach and has led to a substantial reduction of worldwide morbidity.[1–3,8,11,12,66,78](#page-11-0) Strategies include indiscriminate mass treatment; treatment of particular risk groups, especially school-aged children (the global target is to annually treat 75% of at-risk children); and active case finding followed by treatment ([Fig. 126.13\)](#page-10-0). Regular surveillance and/or regular retreatment must be maintained.[77,79,80](#page-12-24)

Schistosomiasis can be eliminated by education, behavioral change, safe water supply, and sanitary engineering.[81,82](#page-12-25) Sites free of exposure for washing, bathing, laundering, swimming, and crop irrigation are required. These must be culturally acceptable and undergo long-term maintenance. Where possible, efforts should be integrated into control of other NTDs, such as lymphatic filariasis, onchocerciasis, and intestinal helminths, as well as provision of vitamins and nutritional supplements[.78](#page-12-26) The massive, and sometimes uncontrolled, use of praziquantel also brings a risk for development of drug resistance, while there are no alternative anti-schistosomal drugs in the pipeline[.74,83](#page-12-27) Ultimately, elimination
