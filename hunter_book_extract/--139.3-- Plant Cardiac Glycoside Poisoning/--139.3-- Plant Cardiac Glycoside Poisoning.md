# **139.3** Plant Cardiac Glycoside Poisoning

*Michael Eddleston*

## KEY FEATURES

- • Cardiac glycosides inhibit the Na<sup>+</sup> /K<sup>+</sup> ATPase on cardiomyocyte membranes, increasing intracellular sodium and calcium concentrations, cardiac excitability, and risk of dysrhythmias.
- • Most poisoning is suicidal, although unintentional poisoning in children or from medicinal use is recognized.
- • Acute poisoning results in vomiting, diarrhea, abdominal pain, hyperkalemia, sinus and atrioventricular (AV) node block, severe bradycardia, and ventricular tachydysrhythmias.
- • Antidigoxin antibodies effectively reverse poisoning but are rarely available because of cost; symptomatic care involves treating bradycardia and hyperkalemia.
- • Case fatality from yellow oleander poisoning is 2.5% to 10%; cardiac glycoside poisoning kills several thousand people every year, with the majority in South Asia.

#### **INTRODUCTION**

Cardiac glycosides occur in many plant families, including Scrophulariaceae (foxgloves), Apocynaceae (oleanders), and Liliaceae (lilies, sea onion). Each plant species synthesizes several glycosides, for example, yellow oleander (*Cascabela thevetia* [L.], syn: *Thevetia*  *peruviana*) [\(Fig. 139.3.1\)](#page-0-0) contains thevetins A and B, thevetoxin, and neriifolin, and sea mango (odollam tree; *Cerbera manghas* Linn) ([Fig. 139.3.2](#page-1-0)) contains cerberin, neriifolin, and cerebroside.[1](#page-1-1)

The glycosides are made up of a sugar moiety and a non-sugar or aglycone moiety; classification into cardenolides or bufadienolides is based upon the aglycone having a five- or a six-membered lactone ring in the C17 position of the steroid nucleus, respectively. The glycosides are not destroyed by either drying or heating of plant material.

#### **EPIDEMIOLOGY**

It seems likely that plants containing cardiac glycosides are responsible for more acute deaths each year than any other plants. Self-poisoning with seeds of the yellow oleander or sea mango causes thousands of deaths every year in South Asia.[2–5](#page-1-2) Unintentional pediatric poisoning occurs with yellow oleander in the tropics and subtropics; ingestion of therapeutic teas made from common oleander (*Nerium oleander*) leaves is an occasional cause of severe poisoning.[6](#page--1-0) In southern Africa, medicinal use of plants containing cardiac glycosides (such as *Urginea sanguinea*) commonly results in unintentional poisoning[.7](#page--1-1)

### **NATURAL HISTORY, PATHOGENESIS, AND PATHOLOGY**

Cardiac glycosides inhibit the Na<sup>+</sup> /K<sup>+</sup> ATPase on cardiomyocyte membranes, causing a fall in intracellular potassium concentration and rise in sodium.[8](#page--1-2) This causes an increase in intracellular calcium due to loss of Na<sup>+</sup> /Ca2<sup>+</sup> exchange activity, which in turn increases

Cardiac glycosides also increase vagal efferent activity to the heart, reducing sinoatrial firing rate (causing bradycardia) and conduction velocity of electrical impulses through the atrioventricular (AV) node. Death occurs from ventricular tachydysrhythmias, likely catecholaminergic polymorphic ventricular tachycardia. Toxicity from oleander poisoning varies by the time of day ingested, with more severe poisoning occurring when ingested in the morning compared with the late afternoon[.5](#page--1-3)

# **PATIENT EVALUATION, DIAGNOSIS, AND DIFFERENTIAL DIAGNOSIS**

Diagnosis is made from the history plus typical toxidrome. Symptomatic patients present with gastrointestinal signs (nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, abdominal pain) and with cardiac dysrhythmias, commonly bradycardia and/or sinus or AV node block[.6,9](#page--1-0) Blood tests show hyperkalemia that correlates with severity of poisoning. Cardiac glycosides can be detected using standard laboratory assays for digitalis glycosides. However, these assays are not quantitative, and apparent cardiac glycoside concentrations should not be used to determine whether to give treatment.

### **TREATMENT**

Pharmaceutical digitalis poisoning is treated with anti-digoxin or digitoxin Fab antibody fragments. The cardiac glycosides in yellow oleander are similar enough to digitalis glycosides for the Fab fragments to be highly effective in reversing gastrointestinal and cardiac toxicity.[10,11](#page--1-4) The indications for administration include complete heart block, Mobitz type II second-degree block, sinus bradycardia with a heart rate of less than 40 beats per minute (bpm) unresponsive to atropine, sinus arrest or block with sinus pauses longer than 2 seconds, serum potassium >5.5 mmol/L, or ventricular tachycardias[.10](#page--1-4) The best regimen is currently unclear. Consider giving 400 mg over 20 minutes followed by 400 to 800 mg over 4 to 8 hours by infusion to provide a therapeutic concentration for a longer period. There is less evidence for use of Fab fragments for poisoning with other plant cardiac glycosides, but case reports suggest benefit. Unfortunately, the cost of these antibodies precludes their use in many places where cases are common.

Two randomized, controlled trials have tested the effectiveness of multiple doses of activated charcoal (MDAC) in yellow oleander poisoning.[8](#page--1-2) The first found a marked reduction in death in patients receiving MDAC compared with a single dose of charcoal (SDAC): case fatality 5/201 (2.5%) patients receiving MDAC versus 16/200 (8%) patients receiving SDAC (*P* = 0.025, relative risk [RR] 0.31, 95% confidence interval [CI], 0.12–0.83).[12](#page--1-5) The second, larger

trial found no effect on mortality of giving MDAC versus SDAC (23/540 [4.3%] vs. 26/549 [4.7%]; RR 0.90, 0.52–1.56).[13](#page--1-6) The reason for this difference in trial results is unclear and precludes a clear conclusion on the effectiveness of MDAC. However, charcoal was found to be safe in these studies, and a single dose is recommended.

The evidence for benefit from other interventions is weak ([Table 139.3.1\)](#page-1-3). Gastric lavage is not recommended. Atropine or isoprenaline and intravenous fluids are used to keep the heart rate above 60 bpm and systolic blood pressure above 80 mmHg. Insulin dextrose is given for serum potassium concentrations above 5.5 mmol/L; hypokalemia and hypomagnesemia should be treated until both are back in the high normal range. In the absence of antidigoxin Fab, consider treating severe bradycardia due to AV block with temporary pacing and ventricular fibrillation with low-energy direct current (DC) defibrillation.
