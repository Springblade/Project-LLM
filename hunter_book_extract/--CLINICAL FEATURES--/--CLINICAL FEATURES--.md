later stages of other prion diseases such as sCJD. In sporadic and genetic forms, the disease process is apparently spontaneous. The inheritance of gPD is autosomal dominant with variable (generally high) penetrance. However, a family history may be absent in around 40% of cases.[5](#page-2-0) The cause of sCJD remains unknown, with the possibility that it is a heterogenous entity and some cases even being covertly acquired. Acquired prion disease requires an infective agent, and this has been termed *the prion;* according to the prion theory, it consists entirely or largely of PrPSc, and infectivity is generally associated with PrPSc; however, its precise nature is undetermined

In acquired disease, the incubation period is potentially long, typically measured in years, but this varies with cause, with means of 11 years in dura mater–related cases, 15 years in human growth hormone cases, and around 13 years in kuru (the range is wide with potentially very long periods). The figure for dietary-acquired vCJD is unknown, but the minimum is thought to be 5 years; reported incubation periods in secondary transmission via blood transfusion are around 7 to 8 years.

Non-pathogenic *PRNP* polymorphisms are potentially important, with one being particularly important: *PRNP* codon 129 methionine/valine (M/V). In acquired forms, this may affect susceptibility or incubation period and may affect the clinicopathologic expression of all forms of prion disease. All tested cases of vCJD have been codon 129 MM, aside from one definite and one possible case, who were both MV.[11,12](#page-2-3) A clinico-pathologicmolecular subclassification of sCJD based on codon 129 genotype and the molecular characteristics of the abnormal prion protein (which has been divided into types I and II) is used regularly in international surveillance[.13](#page-2-4) A more recent further subclassification system is of uncertain utility.[14](#page-2-5)

Prion diseases are universally progressive (often rapidly so), fatal, and currently untreatable illnesses.

## **CLINICAL FEATURES**

The clinical features vary somewhat between the different diseases, but encephalopathic illness with dementia, cerebellar ataxia, and myoclonus is typical.

sCJD, the most common form, affects the middle-aged and elderly (median age at death around 65 years) (see [Fig. 38.9.1](#page--1-0)). Cases below the age of 40 years are exceptionally rare. It typically presents as a rapidly progressive dementia with cerebellar ataxia, visual disturbances, and myoclonus, terminating in an akinetic mute state. The median survival is only around 4 months in most countries, with survival of more than 2 years being rare. Two well-described variations are presentation with a pure cerebellar syndrome and pure visual impairment leading to cortical blindness, although they progress to a similar pre-terminal state as typical sCJD. Other clinical variations exist but are exceptionally rare*.* These clinico-pathologic variations correlate to some degree with *PRNP* codon 129 polymorphism and the prion protein type, with the most typical forms associated with MMI and MVI characteristics.

gPD has a highly varied clinico-pathologic phenotype, partly depending on the underlying *PRNP* mutation, but other factors are obviously relevant, including the *PRNP* 129 genotype. The division of gPD into gCJD, Gerstmann Sträussler Scheinker syndrome (GSS), and fatal familial insomnia (FFI) is arguably now historical, predating mutation characterization, but classical GSS presents as a progressive cerebellar ataxia with relatively late cognitive features, and FFI begins with prominent sleep and autonomic disturbances. In gCJD, the mean age at onset is slightly younger and illness duration is longer than in sCJD. The most common mutation disease is E200K-CJD, which typically clinically resembles sCJD, although a polyneuropathy may be present.[5](#page-2-0)

iCJD in general resembles sCJD, with age at onset reflecting the age of exposure and the incubation period. Human growth hormone–related CJD tends to have a relatively young age at onset, reflecting the age at which hormone treatment is given, and presents differently as a progressive cerebellar syndrome, with relatively minor and late cognitive features.[10](#page-2-2)

vCJD affects a significantly younger age group and progresses more slowly (in the UK: mean age at onset, 28 years; mean duration of illness, 14 months) compared with sCJD (see [Fig. 38.9.1](#page--1-0)). Notably, the initial symptoms may be prominently psychiatric and behavioral. Painful sensory symptoms may be present. As the illness progresses, cerebellar ataxia is usually prominent with cognitive impairment and involuntary movements, including myoclonus. vCJD resulting from blood transfusion has been clinically identical to primary dietary cases.[7](#page-2-1)

# **PATIENT EVALUATION, DIAGNOSIS, AND DIFFERENTIAL DIAGNOSIS**

With no simple, absolute clinical diagnostic test for prion disease, definitive diagnosis requires neuropathology, that is, autopsy or brain biopsy (the main justification for which being its necessity to diagnose an alternative, treatable condition). However, relatively highly reliable clinical diagnosis can often be made with internationally agreed clinical diagnostic criteria.

The potentially wide differential diagnosis of prion disease varies with the clinical presentation, the age of the affected individual, and the local context; there are different practical differential diagnoses of subacute dementia in the UK and Africa. Additionally, vCJD is a more likely diagnosis in the UK than in a country with no previously reported case. There are no systemic abnormalities due to prion disease: no pyrexia or other index of infection, and routine hematology, biochemistry, and immunologic tests are normal. Prion disease may be excluded relatively early in the diagnostic process if there are such features, or the cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) contains excess white cells, or cerebral imaging shows white matter abnormalities or mass lesions. The overall diagnostic process is essentially the suspicion of prion disease based on clinical pattern, the exclusion of other diagnoses, and supportive investigation findings. The role of the supportive diagnostic tests in prion disease are summarized next and in [Table](#page-1-0) [38.9.3](#page-1-0). The electroencephalogram (EEG), CSF, and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) findings are not prion disease specific; it is important to appreciate that although the sensitivity of such tests depends on the nature of prion disease, their specificity depends also on the testing context. They are therefore essentially supportive tests when prion disease is already reasonably suspected; positive results must be viewed in the light of the overall clinical situation. A significant advance in prion disease diagnosis has been the development of disease-specific tests that are based on the detection of abnormal prion protein[.14–20](#page-2-5) As would be expected, given their nature, they have been shown to have specificities either approaching or being 100%, though they are often useful in only specific types of prion disease (see also [Table 38.9.3\)](#page-1-0). Through nasal brushing, it is possible to obtain olfactory neurons that can be used to detect abnormal PrP in all types of CJD, but there are few clinical data available at present[.19](#page-2-6)

### **Sporadic CJD**

In around two thirds of cases, the EEG shows characteristic periodic biphasic or triphasic complexes at some stage of the illness ([Fig. 38.9.2](#page-1-1)). The CSF 14-3-3 protein test is positive in the majority of cases.[21](#page-3-0) The CSF frequently shows basal ganglia (putamen and caudate) and cortical hyperintensity, especially on fluid-attenuated inversion recovery (FLAIR) and diffuse weight imaging (DWI) sequences [\(Fig. 38.9.3](#page-2-7))[.22](#page-3-1) The most specific test for sCJD is the CSF real-time quaking-induced conversion (RT-QuIC) test; interestingly, it has proved negative in all tested cases of vCJD[.15](#page-2-8)

### **Variant CJD**

The EEG usually does not show the periodic activity seen in sCJD; it has been reported in two cases but only in the very late disease stages. The CSF 14-3-3 is positive in less than half of the cases. The cerebral MRI shows hyperintensity in the posterior thalamus (the "pulvinar sign") in over 90% of cases, especially on FLAIR and DWI sequences (see [Fig. 38.9.3](#page-2-7)).[10,23](#page-2-2) In vCJD, in contradistinction to other prion diseases, a tonsil biopsy may show the disease-specific abnormality of PrPSc. Blood and urine tests for vCJD have been developed (see [Table 38.9.3](#page-1-0)). Interestingly, they have proved negative in most cases of sCJD, though very occasional positive results have occurred[.16–18](#page-2-9)

### **Other Forms of Prion Disease**

There are no abnormalities specific to other prion diseases except for genetic forms, where *PRNP* mutation testing can be undertaken on a blood sample. Given the variable clinical phenotypes of gPD, the potential similarity to sCJD, and the frequently absent family history, *PRNP* mutation testing is necessary to definitively distinguish gPD and sCJD, and such testing should be considered in a wide variety of neuropsychiatric illnesses where no other diagnosis is made. Given the variability of sCJD and gCJD and the polymorphism background of vCJD (as discussed earlier), determining the *PRNP* 129 polymorphism may help in the diagnosis of a suspected prion disease.

## <span id="page-2-7"></span>**TREATMENT**

There is no proven disease-modifying treatment for prion disease. In many prion diseases, particularly sCJD, the rapid progression and the lack of any simple absolute diagnostic test mean that most individuals are severely neurologically impaired at the time of diagnosis and therefore arguably beyond the point of useful therapy. There are potential treatment approaches, but given the incomplete understanding of pathogenesis in prion diseases, it is difficult to know if these will lead to actual therapies.[24](#page-3-2)

Quinacrine was proposed as a treatment on the basis of in vitro studies, but in a human clinical trial in the UK failed to confirm any benefit.

Pentosan polysulphate, delivered via the intracerebroventricular route, has also been proposed as a treatment, with some evidence that disease duration has been prolonged in vCJD. A formal controlled trial of flupirtine reported statistically significant, but arguably clinically irrelevant, benefits in sCJD. Recent work has suggested that a prion-protein antibody approach might be therapeutically valuable, but there are no human data yet and no human trial is taking place currently[.25,26](#page-3-3)

Symptomatic treatment is, of course, possible with medication to relieve pain, distress, behavioral difficulties, and involuntary movements on the basis that would be applicable in any neurologic disease. As disability and dependency increase, measures such as urinary catherization and naso-gastric tube/gastrostomy feeding may be appropriate. All management decisions need to be undertaken in the light of the inevitable and ultimately fatal progressive nature of the illness and tailored to the individual circumstances.
