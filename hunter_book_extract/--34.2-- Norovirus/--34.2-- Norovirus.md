# **34.2** Norovirus

*Aron J. Hall, Cristina V. Cardemil, George E. Armah*

## KEY FEATURES

- • Also referred to as Norwalk virus, Norwalk-like virus, calicivirus, small-round structured virus, viral gastroenteritis, "stomach flu," and "winter vomiting disease".
- • Leading cause of epidemic gastroenteritis worldwide and a significant contributor to the diarrheal disease burden across all age groups.
- • Highly transmissible by the fecal–oral or vomitus–oral routes, including direct person-to-person contact, ingestion of contaminated food or water, and contact with contaminated fomites.
- • Disease characterized by acute-onset, watery, non-bloody diarrhea and/or vomiting lasting 1 to 3 days.
- • Generally self-limiting in otherwise healthy individuals, although medical attention may be necessary for dehydration caused by excessive fluid loss.
- • Treatment is primarily supportive consisting of either oral or intravenous fluid therapy, depending on the degree of dehydration.

## **INTRODUCTION**

Gastroenteritis is a leading cause of morbidity and mortality worldwide, accounting for over 1.3 million deaths across all ages in 2013, the vast majority of which occur in developing countries[.1](#page-4-0) Although long recognized as common causes of epidemic gastroenteritis, noroviruses have recently been appreciated as important etiologies in the global gastroenteritis burden, significantly affecting both children and adults. The advent and widespread application of molecular diagnostic techniques, including multi-pathogen panels, have led to a vastly improved understanding of the epidemiology, natural history, and clinical manifestations of norovirus infection. Additionally, the recent description of a human intestinal enteroid culture system to support norovirus replication in vitro is expected to yield advances in the development of diagnostics, including clinical assays, as well as therapeutics[.2](#page-4-1) Candidate norovirus vaccines currently in clinical trials also show promise in potentially enhancing the prevention and control of norovirus.[3](#page-4-2)

### **EPIDEMIOLOGY**

Globally, noroviruses are a leading cause of gastroenteritis across all age groups[.3](#page-4-2) With the continued implementation of rotavirus immunization of infants and the consequent reduction of the burden of severe rotavirus diarrhea, the relative public health impact of noroviruses will continue to increase. As evidenced by widespread acquisition of norovirus antibodies before adulthood,

early exposure to norovirus occurs in both developed and developing countries.[4](#page-4-3) Noroviruses frequently result in outbreaks and cause approximately 50% of all epidemic gastroenteritis worldwide[.5](#page-4-4) Outbreaks have been reported in all age groups and commonly occur in nursing homes, hospital wards, daycare centers, schools, cruise ships, and restaurants. The groups most vulnerable are the elderly, young children, travelers, and the immunocompromised.

Noroviruses have a worldwide distribution with an estimated prevalence of 18% among acute gastroenteritis cases in all age groups[.6](#page-4-5) The World Health Organization (WHO) estimated that worldwide in 2010 there were 685 million cases of norovirus disease, including 212,489 deaths, resulting in an overall disease burden of 15 million disability-adjusted life years (DALYs) and a total societal cost of \$60 billion.[7,8](#page-4-6) Approximately 85% of these global norovirus illnesses and 99% of the deaths occur in developing countries, where the norovirus burden disproportionately affects children aged <5 years. Few studies have examined the burden in adult populations in developing countries, but estimates in high- and upper-middle-income countries indicate 1.2 to 4.8 million illnesses in older adults (≥65 years old) occur annually, as well as 2000 to 13,000 norovirus-associated deaths[.9](#page-4-7) In the United States the vast majority (90%) of norovirus-associated deaths occur in older adults[.10](#page-4-8)

There is substantial genetic diversity among circulating noroviruses. Based on sequencing of the viral genome, seven distinct norovirus genogroups have been identified: GI to GVII [\(Fig.](#page-1-0) [34.2.1](#page-1-0))[.11](#page-4-9) Viruses from genogroups GI, GII, and GIV infect humans, among which at least 33 genotypes have been identified thus far, with those in GII being the most prevalent. Viruses from the GIII and GV to GVII genogroups have only been found in animals. Global norovirus surveillance studies show that GII strains, specifically those within the GII.4 genotype, predominate among human infections.[12](#page-4-10) Genetic drift, reassortment, and population immunity appear to drive the continued emergence of new viral strains, which have subsequently resulted in a pattern of successive global pandemics[.13](#page-4-11)

# **NATURAL HISTORY, PATHOGENESIS, AND PATHOLOGY**

Infection can be acquired by the fecal–oral or vomitus–oral routes, either directly from person-to-person transmission or indirectly through contaminated food, water, or environmental surfaces ([Fig.](#page-2-0) [34.2.2](#page-2-0)). Because acquired immunity to norovirus infection is not lifelong (6 months to 9 years) and there is little heterotypic protection to the diverse viral populations, infection can occur at any

<span id="page-1-0"></span>**Fig. 34.2.1** Phylogenetic tree showing the classification of noroviruses into seven genogroups (GI–GVII) and their associated host(s). GII.4 noroviruses *(arrow)* cause the majority of norovirus outbreaks and sporadic illnesses worldwide. GII.15 noroviruses comprise a tentative new genogroup *(dotted circle)*. (Adapted from Vinje J. Advances in laboratory methods for detection and typing of norovirus. J Clin Microbiol 2015;53(2):373–381.)

age and multiple times throughout a person's lifetime[.14,15](#page-4-13) Noroviruses recognize histo-blood group antigens (HBGAs) that reside on the mucosal epithelia of the digestive tract. As determined by expression of the fucosyltransferase-2 (*FUT2*) gene, persons who are secretors (approximately 80% of Caucasian populations) are associated with increased susceptibility to norovirus infection[.16](#page-4-12) However, this increased susceptibility among secretors is strain specific, driven primarily by GII norovirus (specifically those in genotype GII.4), and there are a range of HBGAs in human populations, so individuals resistant to one strain may still be susceptible to others[.17](#page-4-14)

After infection, histologic changes include broadening and blunting of the intestinal villi, crypt-cell hyperplasia, cytoplasmic vacuolization, and infiltration of polymorphonuclear and mononuclear cells into the lamina propria, whereas the mucosa itself remains intact. Enzymatic activity is decreased, resulting in mild steatorrhea and transient carbohydrate malabsorption.[18](#page-4-15) Severe epithelial barrier dysfunction results in a leak flux mechanism whereby ions and water "leak back" from the subepithelial capillaries into the intestinal lumen due to the increased permeability of the tight junction, in addition to anion secretion in the norovirus-infected small intestine.[19](#page-4-16) The physiologic and molecular mechanisms underlying the rapid onset of diarrhea, vomiting, and other symptoms are not fully understood. Virus is shed in stool for an average of 4 weeks after infection, although peak shedding occurs 2 to 5 days after infection and at a magnitude of 95 billion viral particles per gram of feces[.20](#page-4-17) Up to 30% of norovirus infections are asymptomatic although still capable of significant viral shedding, albeit less than that of symptomatic infections.[21](#page-4-18)

![](_page_2_Figure_5.jpeg)

<span id="page-2-0"></span>**Fig. 34.2.2** The cycle of norovirus transmission begins with infected individuals, including both symptomatic and asymptomatic infections. Symptomatic infection causes intestinal pathology, including blunting of villi, increased cytotoxicity, and increased cell proliferation at the base of crypts. The virus is then shed in stool and vomit of symptomatic individuals, as well as the stool of asymptomatic individuals. Subsequent transmission vehicles may include raw or ready-to-eat foods, drinking or recreational water, contaminated fomites or environments, and direct person-to-person contact. Note that cross-contamination may occur among these vehicles, such as the contamination of fresh produce with irrigation water or shellfish with wastewater. The population exposed to these contaminated vehicles includes both innately susceptible and resistant individuals, as denoted by secretor status. Among exposed secretors, a proportion will have previously acquired immunity and therefore be protected from infection. Those without innate or acquired immunity then become infected, and the cycle begins anew. The specific proportions of individuals who are secretors, have previously acquired immunity, and develop symptomatic infections may vary depending on population, setting, and strain[.16,19–21](#page-4-12)

# **CLINICAL FEATURES**

After an incubation period of 12 to 48 hours, norovirus infection typically causes disease that is characterized by acute onset of diarrhea, vomiting, nausea, and abdominal cramps[.22](#page-4-19) Some patients may experience only vomiting or diarrhea. Diarrheal stools tend to be watery without blood, mucus, or leukocytes. Low-grade fever is present in <50% of patients and typically resolves within 24 hours.[23](#page-4-20) Other constitutional symptoms, including myalgias, headache, and chills, are also commonly reported. Although symptoms may be severe, they typically resolve without treatment after 1 to 3 days in otherwise healthy individuals. However, more prolonged courses of illness lasting 4 to 6 days can occur, particularly among young children, the elderly, and hospitalized patients.[22–24](#page-4-19) Although community-based studies suggest clinical disease associated with norovirus infection is generally milder than that of rotavirus, hospitalized children infected with either virus have similar severity scores[.23](#page-4-20) As such, severity alone does not readily distinguish norovirus disease from other causes of gastroenteritis.

In developed countries, up to 10% of patients with norovirus gastroenteritis seek medical attention, which may include hospitalization and treatment for dehydration[.25](#page-4-21) In developing countries, given the higher prevalence of malnutrition, co-infection with other enteric pathogens, and other co-morbidities, more severe disease manifestations and frequent hospitalizations may occur, although data are limited. Regardless of the setting, individuals with underlying medical conditions, the very young, older adults, and the immunocompromised are at greater risk for severe symptoms and complications, including acute renal failure leading to hemodialysis, cardiac complications including arrhythmias, acute graft organ rejection in transplant recipients, and death.[26–28](#page-4-22) In developed countries, norovirus-associated deaths are more common among older adults and in the context of outbreaks in long-term care facilities.[10,29](#page-4-8) Although long-term sequelae are not common after infection in previously healthy individuals, complications that have been reported include necrotizing enterocolitis in neonates, chronic diarrhea (>1 year) in immunosuppressed patients, and post-infectious irritable bowel syndrome resolving after 3 months.[30–32](#page-4-23) Norovirus infections have also been implicated in causing neurologic manifestations, including benign infantile seizures and encephalopathy, as evidenced by detection of the virus in cerebrospinal fluid[.33,34](#page-4-24) Prospective, analytical studies are needed to better assess these observations and determine the relative frequency of these complications among those infected with norovirus.

# **PATIENT EVALUATION, DIAGNOSIS, AND DIFFERENTIAL DIAGNOSIS**

A broad range of infectious (e.g., bacteria, viruses, and parasites) and non-infectious causes (e.g., medications; toxins; disorders of the gut and peritoneum; and endocrinologic, metabolic, and central nervous system disorders) may cause symptoms of acute gastroenteritis mimicking norovirus infection. Norovirus gastroenteritis is typically characterized by short incubation, short duration, sudden onset (often with no prodrome), and high frequency of vomiting. The 12- to 48-hour incubation period after infection with norovirus can help in distinguishing it from organisms that produce a preformed bacterial toxin and typically have a shorter incubation period of 4 to 6 hours (e.g., *Staphylococcus aureus* or *Bacillus cereus*). In contrast, bacterial pathogens such as *Campylobacter* spp*.*, *Clostridium perfringens, Salmonella* spp., Shiga toxin–producing *Escherichia coli,* and *Shigella* spp. tend to have a longer incubation period and more often cause bloody, mucoid stools compared with norovirus. Other viral etiologies are difficult to differentiate clinically from norovirus. In children, rotavirus is the most common virus to consider in the differential, which typically causes a pronounced dehydrating illness. Other common viruses that clinically mimic norovirus include sapovirus, astrovirus, and adenovirus 40/41.

Sensitive diagnostic assays for clinical diagnosis of norovirus infection are not widely available, particularly in tropical areas. Laboratory confirmation of norovirus rarely informs clinical management, but is crucial for public health surveillance and infection control purposes. RT-PCR, which allows simultaneous detection and quantification, is the reference standard diagnostic for detecting virus in stool, as well as in water and food[.35](#page-4-25) The availability and use of molecular-based diagnostic assays for multiple enteric pathogens have recently increased in clinical and research settings, allowing for the simultaneous detection of multiple viral, bacterial, and parasitic pathogens within a few hours. Immunoassays are also commercially available, but lack adequate sensitivity for routine clinical use[.36](#page-4-26)

Viral load in stool can peak as early as 48 hours after infection, so fecal specimens should be collected as soon as possible after the onset of symptoms.[20](#page-4-17) However, molecular diagnostics may be sensitive enough to detect virus for a week or more after onset of symptoms. Thus for certain epidemiologic investigations (e.g., a suspected link between an ill food worker and a cluster of cases) collection of specimens later in the course of illness may be warranted. Often, the goal of diagnosis is to confirm norovirus as the cause of an outbreak. In such situations specimens should be collected from 6 to 10 cases, given that 2 or more positive specimens are usually recommended for definitive attribution.[37](#page--1-0) Epidemiologic characteristics have also been validated and used to attribute outbreaks to norovirus[,38](#page--1-1) although laboratory diagnostics are still required to confirm etiology.

### **TREATMENT**

No specific therapeutic interventions exist for acute norovirus gastroenteritis. Recommended therapy is similar to that for other causes of viral gastroenteritis, which includes replenishment of intravascular depletion of volume and essential electrolytes. Oral rehydration solutions that provide electrolyte replacement plus glucose or sucrose are recommended as the first-line therapy for uncomplicated diarrheal illness.[39](#page--1-2) A Cochrane review failed to identify any important differences in outcome between oral and intravenous rehydration for acute diarrhea.[40](#page--1-3) Thus unless the patient is in shock or manifests signs and symptoms of severe dehydration or paralytic ileus, initial rehydration efforts with oral solutions should be attempted before intravenous rehydration ([Box](#page-3-0) [34.2.1](#page-3-0)). When severe dehydration is present, more rapid fluid replacement may be necessary using intravenous fluids. As tolerated, patients should resume an age-appropriate diet, including breastfeeding for infants, early in the illness, as adequate caloric intake has been found to enhance patient recovery.[41](#page--1-4)

Anti-motility and anti-secretory drugs are not routinely recommended for children with viral gastroenteritis, due to lack of

#### <span id="page-3-0"></span>**BOX 34.2.1** Treatment Considerations for Pediatric Patients With Acute Norovirus Gastroenteritis

- • For uncomplicated norovirus gastroenteritis, first-line therapy should be oral rehydration solutions providing essential electrolyte replacement plus sugar.
- • Severe dehydration and shock may warrant intravenous fluid replenishment.
- • As tolerated, initiating oral caloric intake early in the illness may enhance patient recovery.
- • In developing countries, adjuvant therapy with zinc may reduce the duration and frequency of diarrhea and help prevent future episodes.
- • Anti-motility and anti-secretory agents should be avoided in children, as they can be associated with rare, severe, adverse complications, such as ileus, lethargy, or death.

high-quality efficacy studies as well as known side effects, including prolonging some bacterial infections and sedating effects that can interfere with rehydration. In select situations, such as for children with mild to moderate dehydration and persistent vomiting that interferes with oral rehydration, the use of the anti-emetic ondansetron may reduce the number of vomiting episodes. Clinical investigations suggest that zinc replacement may shorten the duration of diarrheal episodes in children aged ≥6 months in developing countries with high prevalence of micronutrient malnutrition, and prevent subsequent episodes.[42](#page--1-5) Meta-analyses and systematic reviews have indicated that probiotics (e.g., *Lactobacillus* spp., *Saccharomyces* yeast), when administered early in the course of diarrhea, appear to reduce the duration of diarrhea by one day when used as an adjunct to rehydration therapy[.43](#page--1-6) However, two recent randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trials comparing the effectiveness of *Lactobacillus rhamnosus* and *L. helveticus* to placebo in children presenting to emergency departments in the U.S. and Canada with acute gastroenteritis showed no significant differences in the duration of diarrhea and vomiting, the number of visits to a health care provider, or the duration of daycare absenteeism.[44,45](#page--1-7) The results from these studies suggest more research is needed prior to recommending probiotics for the treatment of diarrhea.

In adults, anti-motility agents such as diphenoxylate or loperamide appear to reduce duration and frequency of diarrhea, and anti-secretory drugs such as bismuth subsalicylate may improve symptoms, but have no effect on the number or consistency of stools[.46](#page--1-8) Antibiotic therapy for the treatment of uncomplicated viral gastroenteritis is not recommended. Research efforts toward the development of anti-viral agents against noroviruses have identified candidate drugs, but clinical trials have not yet been conducted.[47](#page--1-9) Multiple candidate norovirus vaccines are currently in development, and initial clinical trials show promise, although further studies are needed to elucidate the duration of immunity, degree of cross-protection, and potential impacts of vaccination across various target populations.[3](#page-4-2)
