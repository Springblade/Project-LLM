# **<sup>87</sup> 87** Blastomycosis

*Keyur S. Vyas, Robert W. Bradsher, Jr.*

#### KEY FEATURES

- • Endemic mycosis caused by the dimorphic fungus *Blastomyces dermatitidis* and related species.
- • Most often reported from the Mississippi, Ohio, and St. Lawrence river basin areas of North America, with occasional cases reported in Central and South America, Africa, and Europe.
- • Pulmonary infection is common and may be subclinical or present as an acute or chronic pneumonia or chronic mass lesions; skin and bone lesions are also common.
- • Direct visualization of the organism by microscopic examination of stained histopathology or cytology specimens and culture of secretions or tissue remain the cornerstone of diagnosis.
- • Itraconazole is the treatment of choice for most manifestations. Amphotericin B is reserved for initial treatment of life-threatening or central nervous system infection.

#### **INTRODUCTION**

Blastomycosis is an endemic mycosis caused by the dimorphic fungal species *Blastomyces dermatitidis* and *B. gilchristii.* Analysis of atypical specimens has resulted in the description of a third species, *B. helicus* (formerly *Emmonsia helicus*)[.1](#page-2-0) Further work is needed to clarify the role of this agent*.* Historically, disease was termed North American blastomycosis. This terminology has been abandoned, as there have been increasing reports of blastomycosis from other parts of the world. The term *paracoccidioidomycosis* has become accepted for the disease previously called South American blastomycosis, as this is caused by *Paracoccidioides brasiliensis*. Infection typically presents as an acute or indolent pulmonary process or as a chronic skin lesion, although infection of almost any site can occur. Disease may often be misdiagnosed as another type of infection or malignancy. Treatment with antifungal agents is usually successful.

#### **EPIDEMIOLOGY**

Most reported cases of blastomycosis have been from North America, concentrated in the Mississippi, Ohio, and St. Lawrence River basins and the Great Lakes region of the United States and Canada[.3](#page-2-2) Occasional cases have been reported from Africa, Central America, northern South America, and the Mediterranean basin. *B. gilchristii* has been described in Canada and the northern United States, and *B. helicus* has been identified in parts of Canada and the United States west of the traditional endemic area for *B. dermatitidis*. [1,4](#page-2-0) Unlike the causative agents of other endemic mycoses, such as histoplasmosis or coccidioidomycosis, *B. dermatitidis* has not been consistently isolated from the soil, although epidemiologically, this is the source.[5](#page-2-3) Common-source outbreaks have been reported in the literature, and Klein and coworkers provided strong evidence of *B. dermatitidis* in the soil by culturing the organism in association with an epidemic[.6](#page-2-4) In this report, the epidemic was likely due to the presence of moist soil, highly enriched with organic material that provided favorable conditions for the organism to grow. Many patients with infection in this epidemic did not have signs and symptoms characteristic of blastomycosis, supporting the existence of subclinical or self-limited infection, as occurs in histoplasmosis and coccidioidomycosis.

Although there is no particular predisposition to developing blastomycosis, many patients have a history of recreational or occupational exposure to wooded areas and often to soil associated with animals or bodies of freshwater such as lakes and rivers.[2,5](#page-2-1) A review of 1114 cases from the literature revealed that 87% of patients were between 20 and 69 years of age[.7](#page-2-5) The male-to-female ratio is at least 4:1, probably due to differences in exposure[.2](#page-2-1) Although infection in children is rare, it is well documented[.8](#page-2-6) In a recent study of isolates from pediatric patients in Wisconsin, genotypic analysis identified *B. gilchristii* as the causative agent in a majority of cases[.9](#page-2-7) Interestingly, isolates from adult patients from the same region were equally distributed between *B. dermatitidis* and *B. gilchristii*.

Infection has occurred in dogs, cats, cows, and other mammals, but zoonotic spread to humans has not occurred, except in very rare cases of dogs with oral lesions transmitting infection via bites. Likewise, person-to-person transmission is rare, with a single case of a man with genitourinary disease transmitting pelvic blastomycosis to his wife[,10](#page-2-9) and rare cases of intrauterine transmission from mother to child[.11](#page-2-10)

Unlike other endemic mycoses, such as histoplasmosis, coccidioidomycosis, or penicilliosis, blastomycosis has only occasionally been reported as a significant pathogen in patients with AIDS. When it does occur in this setting, it is typically during advanced stages of AIDS with very low CD4 lymphocyte counts. The disease tends to be rapidly progressive, widely disseminated, and usually fatal[.12](#page-2-11) If response to antifungal agents occurs, the patient should be maintained on chronic secondary prophylaxis until immune reconstitution occurs[.13](#page-2-12) Blastomycosis has been reported in patients with other immunosuppressive conditions, such as organ transplantation, hematologic malignancies, corticosteroid use, and, more recently, tumor necrosis factor inhibitor use.

#### **NATURAL HISTORY, PATHOGENESIS, AND PATHOLOGY**

The portal of infection is the lung, via inhalation of infective conidia, which are taken up by bronchopulmonary phagocytes. It is here that the fungus undergoes transformation into the yeast phase. Pulmonary infection may be asymptomatic, present like an acute bacterial pneumonia, or present with a more indolent chronic pneumonia with pulmonary nodules or cavitation. Signs and symptoms of infection after hematogenous spread to skin, bone, prostate, epididymis, or other organs may be non-specific. The inflammatory response is a mixture of granulomatous and pyogenic elements [\(Fig. 87.1](#page-1-0)). Pseudoepitheliomatous hyperplasia and acanthosis are found in skin and mucous membrane lesions, which have prompted misdiagnosis of squamous cell carcinoma or keratoacanthoma in some patients[.3](#page-2-2)

#### **Lung Lesions**

Acute pulmonary blastomycosis can present as an asymptomatic radiographic infiltrate or as a pneumonia that is indistinguishable from acute bacterial pneumonia with fever, chills, and productive cough with or without hemoptysis. Another presentation is several months of fever, night sweats, productive cough, and chest pain; this is typical for patients with chronic pulmonary blastomycosis. Adult respiratory distress syndrome can occur in patients with miliary or endobronchial spread of infection and is associated with a high mortality.

Pulmonary findings are present radiologically in half of patients. The radiologic appearance can resemble bacterial pneumonia in patients who present more acutely [\(Fig. 87.2](#page-1-1)) or as a mass lesion in patients with a more indolent course[.14](#page-2-13) Chronic pulmonary lesions may show fibrosis and cavitation. Calcification, pleural effusion, or hilar adenopathy are rarely encountered.

#### **Skin Lesions**

The skin is the most common extrapulmonary site of infection, with 40% to 80% of patients having skin involvement[.15](#page-2-14) Lesions are often multiple and tend to be located on the face and extremities [\(Fig. 87.3](#page-1-2)). They are typically erythematous, well-circumscribed, hyperkeratotic, crusted nodules or plaques that enlarge over weeks. These lesions may ulcerate to leave an undermined edge. Some central healing can occur in chronic cases forming a hypopigmented, atrophic, fibrotic area. Lesions can also occur in the mucous membranes of the nose, lips, larynx, and vagina.

### **Bone Lesions**

Osteomyelitis occurs in up to 25% of patients, affecting essentially any bone[.3](#page-2-2) Osteolytic lesions and an adjacent cold abscess are typical features. In the majority, concomitant skin or lung infection allows the diagnosis to be made. The treatment course is usually of longer duration for bone infection[.13](#page-2-12)

#### <span id="page-1-2"></span>**Systemic Infections**

Almost every organ has been infected with *B. dermatitidis.* Systemic signs of fever and weight loss are mild early in the course but become progressively more severe with disease extension. After a period of time ranging from weeks to years, chronic infection may disseminate to multiple organs and cause death if unrecognized.

<span id="page-2-15"></span>Spontaneous remission is rarely observed once infection has progressed beyond the lung.

### **PATIENT EVALUATION, DIAGNOSIS, AND DIFFERENTIAL DIAGNOSIS**

Microscopic examination of stained histopathology or cytology specimens and culture of secretions or tissues remains the cornerstone of diagnosis for blastomycosis. When clinical suspicion is high, direct microscopic examination of sputum, skin, abscess fluid, or body fluid after digestion of human cells with 10% potassium hydroxide or staining with calcofluor white or Papanicolaou's stain is the most rapid and effective means for diagnosis. The organism can be visualized in tissue specimens stained with methenamine silver or periodic acid–Schiff stains and appears as a yeast with a single, broad-based bud [\(Fig. 87.4](#page-2-15))[.15](#page-2-14)

Culture is positive in almost all cases. At room temperature, the organism will grow as a mold in 2 to 4 weeks on a wide range of culture media, including Sabouraud agar. Skin tests are neither helpful nor available. Serology using a variety of antigens and methods is unreliable for diagnosis[.16](#page-2-16) An assay to detect *B. dermatitidis* antigens in urine is available commercially and may be helpful, although significant cross-reactivity has been noted with histoplasmosis, paracoccidioidomycosis, and penicilliosis.[17](#page-2-17)

#### **Differential Diagnosis**

Skin lesions may be mistaken for basal or squamous cell carcinoma. Nasal lesions may resemble leishmaniasis and paracoccidioidomycosis. Laryngeal lesions mimic epidermoid carcinoma, both clinically and pathologically. Pulmonary blastomycosis may resemble tuberculosis and other granulomatous infections or bronchogenic carcinoma, both symptomatically and radiographically.

#### **TREATMENT**

The vast majority of patients coming to medical attention will need antifungal chemotherapy[.3](#page-2-2) Oral itraconazole at a dose of 200 to 400 mg daily is now the recommended drug for all but the most severe cases. Amphotericin B was the drug of choice for all patients in the past and remains initial therapy for those with life-threatening blastomycosis or central nervous system (CNS) infection.[13](#page-2-12) The deoxycholate formulation is given intravenously at a dose of 0.7 to 1 mg/kg daily. Alternatively, the liposomal formulation, which is preferred for CNS disease, can be given at 3 to 5 mg/kg daily with fewer side effects but at greater cost. Amphotericin formulations are typically given for 1 to 2 weeks (4–6 weeks for CNS disease) until improvement occurs, after which therapy can be completed with oral itraconazole. Non-life-threatening infections can be treated for the entire course with itraconazole alone. Itraconazole achieves cure rates of approximately 95% in those completing therapy.[18](#page-2-18) It also has fewer adverse effects than amphotericin B. Fluconazole has lower success rates in treatment and requires much higher doses than itraconazole. A few cases have been successfully treated with newer-generation azoles, including voriconazole, posaconazole, or isavuconazole.[19,20](#page-2-19)
