# **35.1** Hepatitis A

*Samer S. El-Kamary, Shyamasundaran Kottilil*

#### KEY FEATURES

- • Enterically transmitted virus with both sporadic cases and epidemic outbreaks (usually water-borne).
- • More asymptomatic or mild infections than jaundiced patients after exposure.
- • Clinical illness is rare in residents of endemic areas due to protection afforded by asymptomatic early childhood exposures; major risk to travelers to these areas.
- • Classic findings are jaundice, anorexia, nausea, hepatic discomfort, and elevated ALT and AST.
- • Vaccine offers excellent protection to travelers and others with potential exposures.

## **INTRODUCTION**

HAV causes *short-incubation infectious hepatitis* that is transmitted by the fecal–oral route and has caused epidemics, particularly when it contaminates the water supply.[1](#page--1-0) HAV is a small, nonenveloped, icosahedral, positive-sense RNA virus in the family Picornaviridae*,* genus *Hepatovirus* ([Fig. 35.1.1\)](#page-0-0).[1](#page--1-0) Although four HAV genotypes are recognized in humans, there is only one HAV serotype such that neutralizing antibody to any HAV strain will protect against infection worldwide.

Most infections in developing countries occur early in life and cause few or no symptoms, whereas infections in transitional or developed countries often lead to acute hepatitis in adolescents and adults. Unlike hepatitis B and C viruses, HAV never causes chronic infection.[1](#page--1-0)

Although *epidemic jaundice* has been recognized from epidemics of "campaign jaundice" that affected armies during the Middle Ages up until the Korean and Vietnam conflicts, HAV was not identified until the 1950s.[2,3](#page--1-1) Diagnostic serologic tests are commercially available, and an effective vaccine is licensed[.4](#page--1-2)

### **EPIDEMIOLOGY**

#### **Age and Pattern of Infection**

Although HAV infection occurs worldwide, the epidemiology differs according to sanitary conditions (e.g., water purification, sewage disposal, and crowding). Nearly all inhabitants of some economically developing countries are infected during their first 2 or 3 years without symptoms. Low-income regions (sub-Saharan Africa and parts of South Asia) have high endemicity and almost no susceptible adolescents and adults, whereas middle-income regions in Asia, Latin America, Eastern Europe, and the Middle East have an intermediate level of endemicity. In countries

## **Routes of Transmission**

HAV-caused acute hepatitis is principally transmitted person to person by a fecal–oral route in persons with close contact.

Asymptomatic transmission between children and then to a parent is especially characteristic, illustrating why daycare centers may be implicated in the spread of infection. Food- and water-borne HAV infection often involves a food handler who failed to observe handwashing protocol after defecation. Contamination of inadequately chlorinated water sources has led to both epidemic and sporadic infections. Shellfish are particularly associated with HAV transmission, because they concentrate the virus by filtering large volumes of contaminated water, as reported in the 1988 massive epidemic in Shanghai. The short period of viremia before the onset of symptoms accounts for rare parenteral transmission.

Specific risk factors in developed countries include contact with another person with hepatitis or jaundice, men having sex with men (MSM), travel to an endemic country, contact with children attending daycare centers, and intravenous drug use. HAV infection is still endemic among Native Americans in the western states and Alaska.

#### **CLINICAL FEATURES**

After a susceptible person ingests food contaminated with HAV, viral replication occurs principally in the liver. Virions can be detected in stool and blood before the onset of symptoms. Serum transaminases increase several days after viral replication, indicating that hepatocellular damage may be immunologically mediated[.1](#page--1-0) Up to 2 weeks after viral excretion and on average 25 to 30 days after exposure, prodromal symptoms may occur. The prodrome, which has an abrupt onset and consists of fever, fatigue, malaise, anorexia, nausea, and vomiting, occurs in over 60% of adults but is uncommon among children. After several days, jaundice occurs in over 60% of adults and less than 25% of children. About 60% of children and 20% of adults have diarrhea. Within 2 weeks of the onset of jaundice, HAV is generally not detected in stool. The serum bilirubin peaks after 7 to 10 days around 10 mg/dL. Within 2 to 4 weeks of the onset of symptoms, jaundice resolves, but malaise, fatigue, and anorexia may be prolonged for months. Hepatic failure occurs in 1 in 300 cases and generally does not result in death or the need for liver transplantation.

Relapsing hepatitis symptoms may occur in up to one-fifth of adult patients within 6 months of resolution of symptoms along with viral excretion and elevated transaminases. Variations include asymptomatic resurgence in liver enzymes, which may persist for as long as a year, and multiple relapses. Prolonged cholestasis with fever, pruritus, and diarrhea can last for months without sequelae[.7](#page--1-5)

#### **DIAGNOSIS**

Infection is diagnosed by detecting IgM antibodies to the virus (IgM anti-HAV) in the blood at the onset of symptoms. It peaks 4 to 6 weeks after exposure and persists for 3 to 12 months. IgG HAV antibodies, which can be detected 1 week after the IgM response, have lifelong neutralizing activity. IgG anti-HAV may also be detected for 2 to 6 months after immunoglobulin administration or HAV vaccination. HAV can also be detected in stool by electron microscopy, which is not a diagnostic tool.

## **TREATMENT**

There is no specific treatment for HAV infection, only symptomatic management[.2,8](#page--1-1)
