# KEY FEATURES

- • Shigellosis is caused by an invasive gram-negative bacterium, *Shigella,* which destroys ileal and colonic epithelium and elicits a local and systemic inflammatory response.
- • Four distinct *Shigella* species cause infection, with clinical presentations varying by species and serotype. Of these, *Shigella dysenteriae* type 1, which has become rare since the start of the new millennium, is associated with pandemic and epidemic disease and the highest mortality rate.
- • Humans are the only reservoir for *Shigella.* Infection occurs by fecal–oral or human-to-human transmission where hygiene and sanitation are problematic, such as in developing countries or in daycare centers.
- • Patients with severe shigellosis have the dysentery syndrome, characterized by tenesmus, cramps, passage of bloody-mucoid stools, and fever.
- • Patients infected with *Shigella* who have dysentery or systemic symptoms benefit from antimicrobial therapy. The value of antimicrobial treatment is uncertain in patients with uncomplicated *Shigella* infection and watery diarrhea.
- • Because of lack of microbiology facilities in most developing country settings, the decision to initiate treatment with an antimicrobial agent should be empiric, based upon a presumptive clinical diagnosis (dysentery being the distinguishing feature) and knowledge of the antimicrobial resistance pattern of circulating strains.
- • Increasing resistance to antimicrobial agents previously effective in treatment of shigellosis has left only two drugs that are widely available for outpatient treatment: ciprofloxacin (or similar fluoroquinolones) and azithromycin. Increasing resistance to these two agents may presage a time when there are no effective agents for the treatment of shigellosis.
- • A number of complications may occur in patients with shigellosis, including hemolytic uremic syndrome (with *S. dysenteriae* type 1), reactive arthritis, and seizures.
- • Synonyms: bacillary dysentery.

### **INTRODUCTION**

*Shigella* infection, though ubiquitous globally, is a much different disease in poor and middle-income countries than in rich countries. Especially in poor countries it remains an important cause of death and results in substantial morbidity, affecting nutrition, growth, and susceptibility to future infections. In rich countries it occurs most commonly in daycare settings, among men having sex with men, and in food-based outbreaks. This chapter will focus on the clinical manifestations, diagnosis, and management of shigellosis in poor countries, where more than 90% of all *Shigella* infections occur.

### **HISTORY AND EPIDEMIOLOGY**

*Shigella dysenteriae* type 1, a gram-negative bacillus, was identified by the Japanese microbiologist Kiyoshi Shiga as a cause of the dysentery syndrome in 1897.[1](#page-7-0) Subsequently, three other species of *Shigella* causing endemic dysentery or diarrhea were identified and received eponymous species names (*S. flexneri, S. boydii,* and *S. sonnei*).[1](#page-7-0) These species are further characterized by serotyping, with over 50 serotypes identified (with *S. sonnei* having only a single serotype). Infection with *S. dysenteriae* type 1, the only species that produces Shiga toxin, causes the most severe disease, *S. sonnei* generally the least severe, and *S. flexneri* infection causing disease of intermediate severity[.2](#page-7-1)

Estimates of the disease burden from *Shigella* infection vary depending on the population studied, the diagnostic test used, and methods used to generalize survey results to the global population.[3,4](#page-7-2) Whatever the methods used, *Shigella* infections are among the four most common pathogens causing enteric infection worldwide[.5](#page-7-3) And if sensitive molecular diagnostic techniques are used*,* and adjustment made for asymptomatic carriage of pathogens, *Shigella* may be the most common cause of moderate to severe enteric infections.[4](#page-7-4) The highest incidence of disease is in children ages 1 to 4 years, an age group in which it is often the most common cause of enteric infection[.6](#page-7-5) Because immunity is in part serotype specific, adults are susceptible to infection even if they have previously been infected with another serotype of *Shigella. Shigella* infections are the second-most common cause of diarrhea mortality after rotavirus, causing an estimated 55,000 deaths globally in children less than 5 years of age.[7](#page-7-6) In contrast to most enteric infections, more deaths from *Shigella* occur in older children and adults (an estimated 110,000) than in those under 5 years of age[.8](#page-7-7)

Humans are the only reservoir of *Shigella* (non-human primates will develop dysentery if challenged but play no role in transmission in community settings). Asymptomatic long-term carriage is uncommon. Shigellae are not hardy in the environment, so the role of fomites is limited. Shigellosis is associated with poor hygiene and underdevelopment. Infections usually result from fecal–oral spread from an infected individual. Flies may play a role in spreading infection. Transmission by water or by commercial food products occurs and is proportionally more common in rich countries. Men who have sex with men and persons with HIV infection are at increased risk for *Shigella* infection, especially severe disease.[9](#page-7-8) This has resulted in changes in the age-distribution pattern of shigellosis in many rich countries but has not had a substantial effect on the epidemiologic pattern of shigellosis in poor countries. *Shigella* transmission is facilitated by the very low infectious inoculum, with fewer than 100 organisms capable of transmitting infection.

In wealthy, industrialized countries *S. sonnei* is the predominant cause of infection; the more virulent *S. flexneri* is less common. The reverse is true in relatively poor countries, where *S. flexneri* predominates [\(Fig. 48.1\)](#page-1-0). The switch from a preponderance of *S. flexneri* infections to *S. sonnei* infections may be a marker of a country's social and economic development.[10](#page-7-9)

Epidemics of dysentery, especially those with high mortality rates, are caused by *S. dysenteriae* type 1 infections. Endemic and epidemic *S. dysenteriae* type 1 infections had, in the last decades of the 20th century, most commonly occurred in South Asia and central and east Africa. Since 2000, *S. dysenteriae* type 1 infections have become rare worldwide. The reasons for this are not understood. *S. dysenteriae* type 1 has previously become uncommon for

Infections with *S. boydii* have historically been most common in South Asia, but account for only a minority of infections even in locations where this species is endemic. Infections with *S. dysenteriae* other than type 1 are even less common.

# **NATURAL HISTORY, PATHOGENESIS, AND PATHOLOGY**

*Shigella* infections have a usual incubation period of 1 to 3 days, with untreated disease lasting 5 days or more. Shigellosis is an infection of the distal ileum and colon. Shigellae are enteroinvasive, that is, they invade, multiply within, and destroy colonic epithelial cells. This results in tissue destruction, mucosal ulceration, disruption of small vessels and hemorrhage, and microabscesses in the colon ([Fig. 48.2\)](#page-1-1). Infection and inflammation are most severe in the rectosigmoid and less severe proximally.[12](#page-7-11)

<span id="page-1-2"></span>Infection elicits—both locally and systemically—a profound inflammatory response with an outpouring of polymorphonuclear cells and mucus. This, along with the blood from the ulceration and destruction of small vessels in the colonic epithelium, results in the characteristic dysenteric stool [\(Fig. 48.3](#page-1-2)). The systemic inflammatory response is reflected in the chills, fever, and profound malaise that often precede the dysentery.

Virulence in *Shigella* is primarily controlled by a 220-kb virulence plasmid that has genes encoding adherence and invasion of colonic epithelial cells and spread within and between cells. It is this plasmid that makes *Shigella* distinct from *Escherichia coli,* which it otherwise closely resembles genetically. *Shigella* survival is enhanced by inducing apoptosis in macrophages, thus circumventing an important component of the host response.

*S. dysenteriae* type 1 produces an exotoxin, Shiga toxin, which inhibits protein synthesis. Its precise role in the pathogenesis of infection remains unclear, but it probably induces vascular damage that results in both the more severe colitis and systemic complications. The latter include hemolytic-uremic syndrome (HUS) and leukemoid reaction that almost never occur with other species or serotypes of *Shigella.*[2](#page-7-1) Non–*S. dysenteriae* type 1 serotypes only rarely (via a lysogenic bacteriophage) have the genetic capability to produce toxin. Additional enterotoxins—*Shigella* enterotoxins (ShET) 1 and 2—are implicated in the watery diarrhea that is often the presenting feature of shigellosis.

### **CLINICAL FEATURES**

The hallmark of *Shigella* infection is dysentery—the frequent, painful passage of small-volume stools that consist of mucus, blood, inflammatory cells, and fecal matter (see [Fig. 48.3\)](#page-1-2) accompanied by tenesmus and cramping. All of these features are a result of the inflammatory and ulcerative changes in the colon. In children with severe colitis, the repeated straining that is associated with the tenesmus can result in rectal prolapse ([Fig. 48.4\)](#page-2-0).

Watery diarrhea, rather than dysentery, can often be the presenting intestinal symptom.[2](#page-7-1) In many patients, especially those with *S. sonnei* infection, the diarrhea remains watery and dysentery never occurs.[13](#page-7-12)

Intestinal complications are most common, but not limited, to *S. dysenteriae* type 1 infection ([Table 48.1\)](#page-3-0). Complications include toxic colitis,[14](#page-7-13) which causes obstruction and systemic toxicity and mimics the toxic colitis seen with ulcerative colitis [\(Fig. 48.5A](#page-2-1) [and B](#page-2-1)) gut perforation, and a protein-losing enteropathy[.15](#page-7-14)

A host of systemic, non-intestinal complications can occur with shigellosis, most of which appear to be more common and more severe among malnourished children in developing countries (see [Table 48.1](#page-3-0))[.2](#page-7-1) **Fig. 48.4** Child with complete rectal prolapse.

Fever is a characteristic of most *Shigella* infections and can often be high (40°C) and sustained. The rapid rise of fever with shigellosis leads to a relatively high incidence of seizures in young children who are infected (≈5% in one study of hospitalized patients)[16](#page-7-15) and can occur with infection of any of the species of *Shigella.*[16](#page-7-15) Metabolic complications can also produce seizures ([Fig. 48.6\)](#page-4-0).

Lethargy and confusion are common in severe shigellosis; obtundation and coma may also occur[.16](#page-7-15) These mental status changes may result from the metabolic derangements or because shigellosis, especially *S. dysenteriae* type 1, induces more generalized, but poorly understood, neurologic complications.

Metabolic complications (see [Table 48.1](#page-3-0)) include hypoglycemia from inadequate gluconeogenesis[17](#page-7-16) and hyponatremia, presumably from inappropriate antidiuretic hormone secretion. Though the

<span id="page-4-0"></span>blood loss from the intestinal micro-hemorrhages is usually not severe enough to cause anemia, it may exacerbate pre-existing anemia. Hypoproteinemia can occur from a combination of protein loss in the gut, diminished nutrition during illness, and systemic inflammation causing diminished protein synthesis.[11](#page-7-10)

*Shigella* may also rarely cause infection of epithelial surfaces outside the gut, including the cornea and the vagina[,12,13](#page-7-11) and may also be systemically invasive, causing sepsis from bloodstream invasion by *Shigella* or other gut flora.[18](#page-7-17)

Perhapsthe mostserious acute complication of *Shigella* infection is the development of hemolytic uremic syndrome (HUS)[.16](#page-7-15) This complication occurs almost exclusively with *S. dysenteriae* type 1 and is similar to the HUS seen with enterohemorrhagic *E. coli* (EHEC), which produces a similar exotoxin. In addition to microangiopathic anemia and renal failure, leukemoid reaction (peripheral blood polymorphonuclear cell count >50,000 mm3 ) and thrombocytopenia may occur in association with HUS, or separately as a "forme fruste" of HUS.

# **PATIENT EVALUATION, DIAGNOSIS, AND DIFFERENTIAL DIAGNOSIS**

The diagnosis of shigellosis is important because antimicrobial therapy provides substantial benefit to patients with dysentery caused by *Shigella.* Antimicrobial therapy both relieves the suffering that occurs from the primary disease—tenesmus is an agonizing condition—and can prevent complications.[19](#page-7-18)

Although isolation of *Shigella* from stool is required for the definitive diagnosis of shigellosis, the time required for isolation (48 hours), the lack of diagnostic microbiologic facilities at most health facilities in developing countries, and the insensitivity of current culture methods require that antimicrobial treatment be based upon a presumptive clinical diagnosis.

In developing countries where shigellosis is endemic, children with dysentery have a high probability of being infected with *Shigella.* In adults, other causes of dysentery are more common than in children, but all patients with severe dysentery in the tropics still have a high probability of having shigellosis.

Other features supportive of the diagnosis of shigellosis include abdominal tenderness, fever (though less common in malnourished children), and rectal prolapse. During an *S. dysenteriae* type 1 epidemic, the probability that dysentery is a result of *Shigella* infection is even greater.

The laboratory test most likely to be available in developing countries is microscopic examination of the stool using either a wet mount or Gram stain. Either will show large numbers of polymorphonuclear cells and erythrocytes. Other supportive laboratory tests include a peripheral blood count with leukocytosis. Though rapid bedside tests for identification of *Shigella* infection have been developed, none are currently in widespread use.

If microbiologic laboratory facilities are available, definitive diagnosis is done by isolation of *Shigella* from the stool. Shigellae are not hardy. Thus cultures are best done by plating a stool sample at the bedside or immediately transporting a sample to the laboratory. Samples requiring a delay are best transported in buffered-glycerol saline, which has a higher yield than the more commonly available Cary–Blair transport media. Stool samples are plated upon media selective for gram-negative organisms. *Shigella* does not ferment lactose and thus appears white or colorless on selective media containing acid-sensitive indicator dyes. Non–lactose-fermenting colonies are then further analyzed using biochemical tests for definitive confirmation that they are *Shigella.*

Both intestinal amebiasis caused by *Entamoeba histolytica* infection and *Salmonella* infections are a much less frequent cause of the dysentery syndrome, especially in children, in poor countries[.20](#page-7-19) Patients with amebiasis are less likely to have fever, have fewer white cells in their stool, and are generally less toxic. If direct microscopy is available, the finding of entero-phagocytic trophozoites of *E. histolytica* on examination of stool is characteristic of amebiasis. *Campylobacter jejuni* infections, though common in children, are less often severely symptomatic; cramping is more common than tenesmus, and stools are less bloody than in shigellosis. Ulcerative colitis is exceedingly rare in comparison with shigellosis.

Patients suspected of having shigellosis should be evaluated for complications (see [Table 48.1](#page-3-0)). Rectal prolapse (see Fig. 48.4) will be evident on cursory examination but may be only intermittently present. Patients with suspected hypoglycemia—either because of alteration in consciousness or preceding severe anorexia—should be monitored using simple finger-prick blood glucose monitoring. Other metabolic abnormalities, including hyponatremia, should also be suspected in patients with altered consciousness and require laboratory monitoring. The development of toxic megacolon is best identified by physical examination showing signs of obstruction: distended abdomen (see [Fig. 48.5A](#page-2-1)) accompanied by vomiting and often hyperactive bowel sounds. Abdominal radiographs will show ileus and findings of obstruction (see [Fig. 48.5B\)](#page-2-1).

If *S. dysenteriae* type 1 infection is suspected, there should be monitoring of hematocrit or hemoglobin and renal function. If severe anemia or diminished renal function (measured either by an increase in blood creatinine or urea nitrogen and diminished urine output) occurs, such patients should be transferred to a facility (if available) capable of conducting renal dialysis.

### **TREATMENT**

# **Antimicrobial Therapy**

Antimicrobial drugs are the definitive treatment for shigellosis, and all persons with symptomatic shigellosis in poor countries should receive antimicrobial therapy. Greatest efficacy is achieved when treatment is initiated early in the course of illness. Controlled trials from the 1950s onward established the value of antimicrobial therapy in children and adults with shigellosis and dysentery[.21](#page-7-20) Treatment shortens the course of illness and pathogen excretion, and reduces complications and mortality[.22](#page-7-21) There is increasing evidence that watery diarrhea caused by *Shigella* infection may lead to increased mortality and have long-term nutritional and developmental effects.[23](#page-7-22) The challenge remains of how to identify such patients in the much larger universe of children with watery diarrhea not requiring antimicrobial therapy. General characteristics of drugs effective in shigellosis are shown in [Box 48.1.](#page-5-0)

Drugs meeting these criteria must still show efficacy in clinical trials. Oral cephalosporins, for instance, have proven ineffective[,24](#page-7-23) presumably because their intracellular activity is low. Previous mainstays of therapy—ampicillin, trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole, nalidixic acid, and tetracycline—are no longer useful because of widespread resistance (indeed, the transfer of multiple-antibiotic

#### <span id="page-5-0"></span>**BOX 48.1** Characteristics of Drugs Effective in the Treatment of Shigellosis

- • Active in vitro against *Shigella*.
- • Systemically absorbed.
- • Achieve serum concentrations in excess of the minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) of the infecting strain of *Shigella* or have high intracellular concentrations, given the intracellular nature of the infection.
- • Can be given orally because of the difficulties of providing parenteral therapy where the majority of *Shigella* infections occur.
- • Available in a liquid formulation suitable for use in children.
- • Inexpensive.
- • Have a high therapeutic index.

resistance by genetic elements such as R-factors [plasmids] encoding for antimicrobial resistance was first described in Shigellae).

The fluoroquinolones and azithromycin are the current drugs of choice for treating shigellosis [\(Table 48.2](#page-6-0)). Diminished susceptibility and frank resistance to these are increasing.[25,26](#page-7-24) Because intracellular concentrations of azithromycin are much higher than serum concentrations, laboratory thresholds for identifying resistance (which have not been defined for *Shigella* but are extrapolated from other Enterobacteriaceae) may not correlate with clinical efficacy. Patients are unlikely to respond, however, when infected with isolates with high-level resistance. Knowledge of the prevalence of resistance in a community is a prerequisite for deciding on empiric therapy. This requires ongoing surveillance—something often lacking in developing countries where shigellosis is most common. No new drugs for the treatment of shigellosis have been introduced in the more than 20 years since azithromycin was first evaluated for treatment of shigellosis in 1997,[27](#page-7-25) and none are on the near horizon. This raises the specter of having a common and potentially lethal infection for which there is no effective antimicrobial therapy.

# **Supportive Therapy and Treatment of Complications**

Severe dehydration is not a common feature of shigellosis, and thus intravenous therapy is rarely required in conscious patients[.2](#page-7-1) Patients should receive oral rehydration therapy to replace fluid loss.

Equally important is early feeding[.28](#page-7-26) Because of the anorexia, protein loss in the gut, and increased metabolism, the development of malnutrition (or exacerbation of pre-existing malnutrition) is an important complication of shigellosis. Aggressive feeding with a high-protein diet can ameliorate the nutritional deterioration that follows dysentery with *Shigella* and also help prevent hypoglycemia. In infants, continued breastfeeding should be encouraged throughout the course of the illness. Nasogastric feeding can be used in children who are severely anorexic.

Supplemental zinc reduces the severity and duration of the acute infection and reduces the incidence and severity of diarrhea in the 3 months after infection. Vitamin A supplementation has not shown benefit during the acute infection, but has other potential benefits. Doses for vitamin A and zinc are shown in [Box 48.2](#page-7-27).

Rectal prolapse is best treated with warm magnesium sulfate compresses to reduce edema. Convulsions that occur in the absence of any metabolic derangements, such as hyponatremia or hypoglycemia, are usually not complex or sustained and are best managed using local protocols for the management of febrile convulsions in children, including the provision of antipyretics.

#### **ZINC SUPPLEMENTATION**

0–6 months of age: 10 mg elemental zinc daily for 10 days 7–50 months of age: 20 mg elemental zinc daily for 10 days

#### **VITAMIN A SUPPLEMENTATION**

Given to malnourished children who have not received vitamin A in last 6 months

<6 months of age: 50,000 units 6–12 months of age: 100,000 units 12–60 months of age: 200,000 units

### **PREVENTION**

Although efforts to develop an effective vaccine are ongoing, vaccine development is complicated by the multiple serotypes in circulation. No candidate vaccine has shown sufficient efficacy to warrant extensive clinical trials or licensing[.29](#page-7-29) Control of shigellosis for the foreseeable future requires improvement in hygiene and nutrition (including encouraging breastfeeding), appropriate identification and treatment of those who are infected, and improvement in socioeconomic conditions. The latter is likely to reduce the household crowding and lack of access to potable water that facilitate *Shigella* transmission. Indeed reduction in levels of poverty over the past decades has been accompanied by decreases in *Shigella* mortality[,8](#page-7-7) a trend that is hopefully likely to continue.
