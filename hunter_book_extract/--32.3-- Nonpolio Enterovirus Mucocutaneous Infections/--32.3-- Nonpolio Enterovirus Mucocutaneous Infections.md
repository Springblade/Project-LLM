*Catherine G. Sutcliffe, William J. Moss*

#### KEY FEATURES

- • Enteroviruses replicate within the gastrointestinal tract or other mucosal surfaces.
- • Acute hemorrhagic conjunctivitis is primarily caused by enterovirus 70 and a variant of coxsackievirus A24.
- • Epidemics of hemorrhagic conjunctivitis can be explosive, with up to 100% of household members and 15% of the population ultimately infected.
- • Hand-foot-and-mouth disease is most commonly caused by coxsackievirus A16 and enterovirus 71.
- • Rarely, hand-foot-and-mouth disease caused by enterovirus 71 may be associated with severe neurologic complications (see Chapter 38.2).
- • A large outbreak due to enterovirus D68 in North America in 2014 caused respiratory illness that was particularly severe in children with asthma and was associated with acute flaccid paralysis.

### **INTRODUCTION**

Enteroviruses are members of the Picornaviridae family and are non-enveloped viruses with a single-stranded RNA genome that replicate within the gastrointestinal tract or other mucosal surfaces. More than 90 sub-types of enteroviruses have been identified. Human enteroviruses were formally divided into five sub-groups: polioviruses, group A and B coxsackieviruses, echoviruses, and the numbered human enteroviruses. In 2000 the International Committee on Taxonomy of Viruses reclassified human enteroviruses into four species consisting of human enteroviruses A, B, C (containing the polioviruses), and D [\(Table 32.3.1\)](#page-0-0).[1](#page-2-0) In addition to the four human enterovirus species A–D, other enteroviral species include human rhinoviruses (A–C) and porcine, bovine, and simian enteroviruses. Echoviruses 22 and 23 were reclassified as a new genus called *parechoviruses* (human parechoviruses 1 and 2).

Enteroviruses are ubiquitous, and most infections are asymptomatic, but this large group of viruses is increasingly seen

as important human pathogens[.2,3](#page-2-1) Some enteroviruses, best known for mucocutaneous disease, are discussed in this chapter. Enteroviruses that are best known for causing neurologic disease, including polioviruses and enterovirus 71, are discussed in Chapter 38.2. Several enteroviruses have emerged that have pandemic potential, including those causing acute hemorrhagic conjunctivitis, handfoot-and-mouth disease (HFMD), and respiratory illness (enterovirus D68).

#### **EPIDEMIOLOGY**

Acute hemorrhagic conjunctivitis is primarily caused by enterovirus 70 and a variant of coxsackievirus A24; however, other enteroviruses, including echoviruses 7 and 11, coxsackieviruses B1 and B2, and several adenoviruses, can also cause acute hemorrhagic conjunctivitis, sporadic conjunctivitis, and keratoconjunctivitis. The first pandemic of hemorrhagic conjunctivitis was identified in Ghana in 1969 with subsequent spread to other countries in Africa and Southeast Asia, India, Japan, and England between 1969 and 1971, affecting millions of people.[4](#page-2-2) Enteroviruses capable of causing hemorrhagic conjunctivitis are highly transmissible, particularly in densely populated areas in the tropics, where good hygiene is not easy, and are spread either directly through ocular and respiratory secretions or indirectly through contaminated fomites (inanimate objects such as toys). Epidemics of hemorrhagic conjunctivitis can be explosive, with up to 100% of household members and 15% of the population ultimately infected. Outbreaks can be seasonal, particularly in the Western Hemisphere. Individuals of both sexes and all ages are susceptible, although adolescents and young adults are most commonly infected[.5](#page-2-3)

HFMD is most commonly caused by coxsackievirus A16 and enterovirus 71. Coxsackievirus A6 and coxsackievirus A10 have recently caused sporadic cases and outbreaks of HFMD, particularly in Southeast Asia and Europe[.2](#page-2-1) Other enteroviruses associated with HFMD include coxsackieviruses A4–A7, A9, A24, and B2–B5; echoviruses 1, 4, 11, and 18; and enterovirus 18. HFMD was first described during an outbreak in 195[81](#page-2-0) and has been reported in North and South America, Europe, and Asia. However, since the 1990s, enterovirus 71–associated outbreaks have occurred most frequently in Taiwan, Singapore, Malaysia, China, Vietnam, and Australia[6](#page-2-4) (see Chapter 38.2).

#### **NATURAL HISTORY, PATHOGENESIS, AND PATHOLOGY**

Direct transmission of enterovirus 70 or coxsackievirus A24 from infected hands or fomites to the eye permits viral replication in the palpebral and bulbar conjunctivae and corneal epithelial cells. Both viruses bind to sialic acid on ocular epithelium, but coxsackievirus A24 can also bind to cells expressing sialic acid in the respiratory tract—accounting for concurrent respiratory symptoms.[7](#page-2-5) Viral replication in the conjunctivae and cornea leads to the destruction of cells and resulting hemorrhagic conjunctivitis. The incubation period from the time of exposure to conjunctivitis is typically 24 to 72 hours. Disease severity is variable and depends on the number of infected cells and extent of inflammation. Protective immune responses are elicited after enterovirus 70 and coxsackievirus A24 infections; however, immunity to enterovirus 70 wanes within 7 years, leaving individuals susceptible to re-infection[.8](#page-2-6)

The pathogenesis of HFMD remains unclear, but fecal–oral transmission likely leads to virus replication in the lower gastrointestinal tract, followed by viremia and further replication in the oropharynx (see Chapter 38.2).

### **CLINICAL FEATURES**

**C**

Most enteroviral infections are asymptomatic or associated with a non-specific febrile illness. Signs and symptoms of respiratory tract infection (coryza, pharyngitis, and pneumonia) and herpangina (multiple oral ulcers at the back of the oral cavity) may occur, but it remains unclear if enteroviruses are a significant cause of vomiting, diarrhea, or abdominal pain. Rare, serious clinical manifestations include neonatal sepsis, meningoencephalitis, and myopericarditis. Infection with enterovirus 71 can result in pulmonary edema, pulmonary hemorrhage, and cardiopulmonary failure. Chronic enterovirus infection can occur in persons with defective B-lymphocyte function, including those with X-linked agammaglobulinemia, severe combined immunodeficiency, or common variable immunodeficiency.

Individuals with acute hemorrhagic conjunctivitis have abrupt onset of eye pain, photophobia, and swelling of the eyelids. Fever, headache, and pre-auricular lymphadenopathy may occur. Subconjunctival hemorrhage is the characteristic clinical manifestation and occurs in most ocular infections caused by enterovirus 70 but is less common with coxsackievirus A24 ocular infection. Signs and symptoms typically peak on the first day of infection and resolve within several days without complications.

Children with HFMD usually present with fever, sore throat, and refusal to eat. Physical examination reveals vesicles and ulcers on the buccal mucosa and tongue, and papules and vesicles with surrounding erythema on the hands, feet, wrists, ankles, buttocks, and genitalia. HFMD caused by enterovirus 71 and coxsackievirus A16 is usually indistinguishable, although some observers state that the skin lesions associated with coxsackievirus A16 infection are larger and the lesions of enterovirus 71 infection are more commonly papular and petechial[.9](#page-2-7) Rarely, HFMD caused by enterovirus 71 may be associated with severe neurologic complications, including aseptic meningitis, brainstem or cerebellar encephalitis, and acute flaccid paralysis (see Chapter 38.2). Permanent paralysis or death can result, with an estimated case-fatality ratio of 1.7%.[10](#page-2-8)

Other severe systemic manifestations of enterovirus infections include acute respiratory disease, particularly with coxsackie A21 and A24, echovirus 11, and more recently enterovirus D6[811;](#page-2-9) epidemic pleurodynia, characterized by chest pains, and caused by coxsackie B viruses; myocarditis and pericarditis, caused by coxsackie B viruses; and neonatal enterovirus infections, caused, in particular, by echovirus 11 and coxsackievirus B.

### **PATIENT EVALUATION, DIAGNOSIS, AND DIFFERENTIAL DIAGNOSIS**

Enterovirus infection should be suspected in persons with hemorrhagic conjunctivitis and those with vesicles and papules on the hands and feet and in the oropharynx ([Fig. 32.3.1\)](#page-1-0). The diagnosis is usually first made on clinical grounds, but enterovirus infection

can be confirmed by cell culture or identification of viral RNA by reverse-transcriptase polymerase chain reaction. The generalized rash associated with enterovirus infection can resemble that of measles, rubella, or roseola. Acute hemorrhagic conjunctivitis can be caused by enteroviruses other than enterovirus 70 and coxsackievirus A24, as well as adenoviruses (particularly type 11). However, these viral causes cannot be clinically distinguished. The skin lesions of HFMD may resemble those of herpes simplex virus or varicellazoster virus infections [\(Table 32.3.2](#page-2-10))[,3](#page-2-11) and the acute flaccid paralysis can be confused with paralytic poliomyelitis. Surveillance for acute flaccid paralysis as part of the Global Polio Eradication Initiative most commonly detects non-polio enteroviruses.[12](#page-2-12)

## **PREVENTION AND TREATMENT**

Good hygiene, particularly handwashing, limits fecal–oral or ocular transmission and is the primary method of preventing enterovirus infection. Social distancing measures, such as closing schools, are also used.[13](#page-2-13) In December 2015, China's Food and Drug Administration approved two inactivated enterovirus 71 whole-virus vaccines for the prevention of severe HFMD.[14,15](#page-2-14) Vaccine efficacy after two doses of inactivated enterovirus 71 was approximately 95% or higher in clinical trials[.16,17](#page-2-15) No specific therapy for enterovirus infection is recommended, although several drugs are in development[.18](#page-2-16) Pleconaril showed promise in improving survival in neonates with enterovirus sepsis.[19](#page-2-17) Intravenous immune globulin has been used to treat severe enteroviral infections, including overwhelming infection in neonates, myocarditis, and meningoencephalitis, but data from controlled clinical trials are not available.
