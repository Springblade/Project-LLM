# **<sup>109</sup> 109** Microsporidiosis

*Louis M. Weiss*

#### KEY FEATURES

- • Microsporidia are a diverse group of obligate, intracellular, eukaryotic parasites that are closely related to the Fungi.
- • Microsporidia form characteristic spores that are diagnostic for the phylum. Spores possess a unique organelle—the polar tube or polar filament—which is coiled inside the spore.
- • Spores of species that are associated with human infection measure 1 to 4 µm.
- • Although microsporidia can infect immunocompetent hosts, they are more commonly seen in the setting of cell-mediated immune dysfunction.
- • The most common manifestations of microsporidiosis are diarrhea and keratoconjunctivitis; however, these pathogenic organisms can infect virtually any organ, causing a variety of symptoms, including disseminated disease, hepatitis, myositis, kidney and urogenital infection, ascites, cholangitis, and asymptomatic carriage.
- • Examination of stool or urine specimens using special stains is a practical method for the diagnosis of microsporidiosis. Definitive species diagnosis requires transmission electron microscopy visualization of spore ultrastructure or molecular methods (polymerase chain reaction).
- • Albendazole is the drug of choice to treat gastroenteritis caused by *Encephalitozoon intestinalis* and to treat disseminated microsporidiosis with or without local manifestations (e.g., infection due to *E. hellem, E. cuniculi, E. intestinalis, Pleistophora* spp., *Trachipleistophora* spp., *Anncaliia* spp.).
- • Fumagillin is the drug of choice to treat gastroenteritis and disseminated infection caused by *Enterocytozoon bieneusi,* but use of this drug is associated with thrombocytopenia and it is not commercially available in the United States.
- • The treatment of choice for ocular microsporidiosis (e.g., infection due to *E. hellem, E. cuniculi, Vittaforma corneae*) is oral albendazole plus topical fumagillin. Corneal infections with *V. corneae* often do not respond to chemotherapy and may require keratoplasty.

#### **INTRODUCTION**

First recognized by Nageli in 1857 as the cause of disease in silkworms, microsporidia were not suspected as being a cause of human disease until 1959, when they were found in a child with encephalitis. Conclusive evidence of microsporidia as a pathogen dates to 1973, when a 4-month-old athymic boy died with severe diarrhea and malabsorption caused by *Nosema* (now *Anncaliia*) *connori* [\(Fig. 109.1](#page-1-0)). Interest and knowledge of microsporidia as parasites of humans has expanded dramatically since they were recognized as a cause of persistent diarrhea and systemic disease in persons with AIDS.[1,2](#page-5-0)

Microsporidia are obligate, intracellular parasites that are classified in a separate phylum—the Microsporidia—consisting of approximately 200 genera and more than 1400 species.[2,3](#page-5-1) They are classified based on their ultrastructural features, including size and morphology of the spores, number of coils of the polar tube, developmental life cycle, and host–parasite relationship.[4](#page-5-2) The genome size of microsporidia varies from 2.3 to 19.5 Mb, with that of the Encephalitozoonidae being less than 3.0 Mb, making them among the smallest eukaryotic nuclear genomes so far identified. Molecular data, based primarily on small subunit RNA genes, have also been used to define taxonomic relationships and for the diagnosis of these pathogens. These organisms were previously considered "primitive" protozoa; however, molecular phylogenetic analysis has resulted in the insight that these organisms are not primitive, but instead are degenerate and that the Microsporidia are related to Fungi, either as a basal branch or as a sister group[.5–8](#page-5-3) Recent phylogenetic studies indicate that the Microsporidia are part of a sister clade to the Fungi along with *Rozella,* a hyperparasitic chytrid that infects other chytrids, and other Cryptomycota. Environmental microbiome studies have helped to define the Cryptomycota, which includes aphelids, *Rozella,* and other fungal relatives, which are poorly described at the biologic level. These and other recently described microsporidia-like organisms (e.g., *Mitosporidium daphniae, Nucleophaga terricolae,* and *Paramicrosporidium*) illustrate that more environmental sampling and genome sequencing will be needed to fully resolve the relationship of the Microsporidia and Fungi.

#### **EPIDEMIOLOGY**

Microsporidia infect virtually all animal phyla. They have a worldwide distribution and are important agricultural parasites in insects, fish, and mammals.[9](#page-5-4) They have been found in every tissue and organ, and spores are common in environmental sources[.2](#page-5-1) Many human infections are likely zoonotic and/or transmitted by water[.10](#page-5-5) Domestic and wild animals may be naturally infected with *Enterocytozoon cuniculi, E. intestinalis,* and *E. bieneusi.* Birds, especially parrots (parakeets, love birds, budgies), are naturally infected with *E. hellem. Anncaliia algerae* has been identified in several insects. *E. bieneusi* and *Vittaforma corneae* have been identified in surface waters, and spores of *Nosema* sp. (likely *A. algerae*) have been identified in ditchwater. Human-to-human transmission is likely, although not proven.

The prevalence of microsporidiosis varies from not detected to over 80% depending on the geographic region, method of diagnosis, and demographic characteristics of the population being studied. Microsporidiosis is increasingly recognized in non–HIVinfected populations, such as travelers, children, the elderly, and organ transplant recipients. Most infections in immune competent hosts are likely self-limited or asymptomatic. Current understanding suggests that microsporidian infection is common in humans and other mammals; infection is often associated with travel or residence in low-income countries[.11](#page-5-6) Microsporidian keratitis is increasingly recognized in endemic areas and is likely associated with exposure to soil, muddy water, and minor trauma, with higher incidence during the rainy season[.12](#page-5-7)

Microsporidia are single-cell, intracellular parasites containing a nucleus with a nuclear envelope, an intracytoplasmic membrane system, chromosome separation on mitotic spindles, a vesicular Golgi, and mitosomes (a mitochondrial "remnant"). The infectious spore is characteristic of the phylum: it is unicellular with an environmentally resistant spore wall, one or two nuclei, and an extrusion apparatus consisting of a single polar tube with an anterior attachment complex. During germination, the polar tube rapidly everts, forming a hollow tube that both transports and inoculates the sporoplasm into the host cell.[2](#page-5-1)

Most microsporidian infections occur when infectious spores are ingested or inhaled. *E. bieneusi,* the most frequently encountered intestinal microsporidia in patients with AIDS, primarily causes intestinal infections with less frequent extra-intestinal infections. Like *E. bieneusi, Encephalitozoon intestinalis* may infect enterocytes and cause chronic diarrhea. However, through the infection of macrophages, *E. intestinalis* can disseminate to different organs, especially the kidneys, from which spores are shed in the urine.

The life cycle of these pathogenic protists begins when the spores germinate, resulting in the extrusion of its polar tube and infection of a host epithelial cell or phagocytosis by a host cell. The spore injects the infective sporoplasm into the eukaryotic host cell through the polar tube. Inside the cell, the sporoplasm undergoes extensive multiplication either by merogony (binary fission) or schizogony (multiple fission). This development can occur either in direct contact with the host cell cytoplasm (e.g., *E. bieneusi*) or inside a parasitophorous vacuole (e.g., *E. intestinalis*). Microsporidia develop by sporogony to mature spores. During sporogony, a thick wall is formed around the spore, which provides resistance to adverse environmental conditions. When the spores increase in number and completely fill the host cell cytoplasm, the cell membrane is disrupted and releases the spores to the surroundings. These free mature spores can infect new cells, thus continuing the cycle.

Within their hosts, most species infect the digestive tract, but reproductive, respiratory, muscular, excretory, and nervous system infections are well documented[.2](#page-5-1) Microsporidiosis in humans is most often identified in the setting of immune deficiencies, characterized by defects in cell-mediated immunity (especially in patients with AIDS).[10](#page-5-5) A strong humoral response occurs during infection and includes antibodies that react with the spore wall and polar tube. Spontaneous cure of microsporidiosis can be induced

by immune reconstitution, for example, by the use of combination antiretroviral treatment (cART) in patients with AIDS.[13](#page-5-8)

#### **CLINICAL FEATURES**

Microsporidian genera associated with human disease and their clinical manifestations are described in [Table 109.1.](#page-1-1) Human microsporidiosis represents an important and emerging opportunistic disease, occurring mainly, but not exclusively, in severely immunocompromised patients with AIDS.[2](#page-5-1) Additionally, cases of microsporidiosis in immunocompromised persons not infected with HIV, as well as in immunocompetent persons, have been reported. Microsporidia are likely common enteric pathogens causing self-limited disease and asymptomatic carriage. The clinical manifestations of microsporidiosis are very diverse, varying according to the causal species, with chronic or persistent diarrhea being the most common presenting syndrome. Microsporidiosis can also present as keratoconjunctivitis, disseminated disease, hepatitis, myositis, kidney and urogenital infection, ascites, and/ or cholangitis.

The genus *Microsporidium* is used to designate microsporidia of uncertain taxonomic status. No one genus is uniquely associated with a specific clinical syndrome; rather, there is considerable overlap in clinical disease across species.

#### **Infections in Immunocompetent Patients**

Chronic diarrhea and ocular infections are the most common presentations in immunocompetent hosts. *E. bieneusi* has been identified as a cause of self-limited diarrhea in immunocompetent patients and travelers, and has been found in up to 10% of African children with diarrhea. *E. intestinalis* was found in 8% of the stools of patients in a survey for the etiology of diarrhea in Mexico and has been seen in travelers with chronic diarrhea [\(Fig. 109.2](#page-2-0)). Cerebral infections due to *Encephalitozoon* spp. were identified serologically in a 3-year-old boy with seizures and hepatomegaly and a 9-year-old Japanese boy with headache, vomiting, spastic convulsions, and recurrent fever. An unidentified microsporidium responsive to albendazole was described causing multiple cerebral lesions in a 33-year-old man in Japan. *Pleistophora* spp*.* have been identified in the skeletal muscle of an HIV-negative patient with myositis.

Ocular infections with ulcer or deep cornea stroma infection associated with eye pain have been reported in immunocompetent patients[.14](#page-5-9) In 1973 and 1981, two cases were documented in immunocompetent patients from Botswana (*Microsporidium*

**Fig. 109.2** *Encephalitozoon intestinalis* gastrointestinal tract infection. As can be seen in this tissue section stained with a modified trichrome stain, this organism is present on the apical and basal surface as well as in the lamina propria.

*africanus*) and Sri Lanka (*M. ceylonesis).* Other cases of keratitis have since been identified to be caused by *Nosema ocularum* and *N. corneum* (now *V. corneae*). Treatment of these infections has often required surgery (keratoplasty and/or corneal transplant). *Encephalitozoon* spp. and *Trachipleistophora anthropophthera* corneal infections have been described in contact lens wearers. These infections have responded to topical therapy. There have been several case series reported from India, Southeast Asia, and Oceania of immunocompetent patients with epidemic keratoconjunctivitis associated with *V. corneae* or a similar microsporidium.[15](#page-5-10) Many of these resolved without specific treatment.

#### **Infections in Patients With Immune Deficiencies**

Although the majority of reported infections have been in patients with advanced AIDS with CD4 counts less than 100 cells/mm3 , infections have also been increasingly reported in patients with organ transplantation, patients with various hematologic malignancies, and patients being treated with other immunosuppressive medications (especially antibodies to tumor necrosis factor [TNF] α). Gastrointestinal infection usually involves chronic diarrhea of 3 to 10 bowel movements per day, anorexia, weight loss, and bloating without associated fever. It is usually caused by *E. bieneusi* and, occasionally, *E. intestinalis;* however, other microsporidia have also been demonstrated in cases of diarrheal disease (e.g., *Anncaliia connori, Vittaforma* spp*., E. hellem, E. cuniculi*). In patients undergoing liver and bone marrow transplantation, clinical manifestations have included watery, non-bloody diarrhea; nausea; and diffuse abdominal pain. Kotler and Orenstein found that 39% of patients with HIV and diarrhea presenting to a gastroenterology clinic had microsporidiosis and that the presence of these pathogens was associated with wasting, a mean CD4 count of 28 cells/mm3 , and an abnormal D-xylose test result, whereas only 2.6% of HIV-infected patients without diarrhea had microsporidiosis[.16](#page-5-11) Coyle and colleagues, using polymerase chain reaction (PCR) employing primers to the small subunit rRNA gene of *E. bieneusi,* also found a significant association between the presence of diarrhea and microsporidia in patients with AIDS[.14](#page-5-9)

Ocular infection in immunocompromised hosts has been restricted to the superficial epithelium of the cornea and conjunctiva (i.e., superficial keratoconjunctivitis) ([Fig. 109.3\)](#page-3-0). This keratitis rarely progresses to corneal ulceration. Most patients present with bilateral, coarse punctate epithelial keratopathy and conjunctival inflammation resulting in redness, foreign body sensation, photophobia, and changes in visual acuity.[17](#page-5-12) Biopsy specimens examined with transmission electron microscopy (TEM) have revealed numerous microsporidian spores within the corneal and conjunctival epithelium. Of the reports in the literature of microsporidian keratitis caused by Encephalitozoonidae, all but three have been attributed to *E. hellem,* including three cases originally classified as *E. cuniculi. Trachipleistophora* spp. have also been associated with keratoconjunctivitis in patients with AIDS and *A. algerae* in a patient with hematologic malignancy. Ocular disease is usually associated with disseminated disease, and examination of urine sediments can confirm microsporidian spores. Physical examination reveals conjunctival hyperemia with superficial punctate keratopathy. Slit lamp examination usually demonstrates punctate epithelial opacities, granular epithelial cells (with irregular fluorescein uptake), conjunctival injection, superficial corneal infiltrates, and an inflamed anterior chamber.

Several species of microsporidia have been described as causing myositis in patients with immune deficiencies, often with associated disseminated infections. These cases have presented with myalgias, weakness, elevated serum creatinine phosphokinase and aldolase levels, and abnormal electromyography consistent with an inflammatory myopathy. *T. hominis* has been described in several patients with AIDS as a cause of disseminated disease with an associated myositis. *T. anthropophthera* was described in several patients with

Biopsies from a patient infected with *Endoreticulatus* sp*.* who experienced difficulty swallowing and muscle pain displayed both necrotizing granulomatous inflammation in the muscle tissue and clusters of spores and an increase in plasma cells and histiocytes in the bone marrow. Myositis was documented to be caused by *A. algerae* in a patient with rheumatoid arthritis treated with steroids and monoclonal antibody to TNF-α [\(Fig. 109.4\)](#page-3-1). Systemic infection with *V. corneae* has been reported in a patient with AIDS. In a child with leukemia, skin infection with involvement of the cellular elements of the dermis caused by *A. algerae* has been reported. Various microsporidia, such as *E. bieneusi, Encephalitozoon* spp., *T. acridophagus,* and *A. algerae* have been identified in patients with organ transplants, including those receiving kidney, liver, heart–lung, pancreatic, or bone marrow transplants. These infections in patients with organ transplantation have presented with various manifestations, including diarrhea as well as disseminated disease with fever.

### **PATIENT EVALUATION, DIAGNOSIS, AND DIFFERENTIAL DIAGNOSIS**

A confirmed diagnosis of microsporidiosis requires parasitologic confirmation of the parasite in a clinical specimen with an appropriate laboratory test. Several methods are useful for diagnosing suspected microsporidiosis.

Examination of stool specimens by light microscopy using modified trichrome stain (Chromotrope 2R) ([Fig. 109.5](#page-4-0)), Uvitex 2B, or calcofluor white is the standard method for diagnosing gastrointestinal microsporidiosis. Overall, the sensitivity of Uvitex 2B and calcofluor white is slightly higher than that of modified trichrome stain; however, the specificity of the chemofluorescent stains is lower. Microscopy does not allow identification of microsporidia to the species level.

The most widely used staining technique is the Chromotrope 2R method or its modifications. This technique stains the spore and the spore wall a bright pinkish red. Often, a beltlike stripe, which also stains pinkish red, is seen in the middle of the spore. However, this technique is lengthy and time consuming, requiring about 90 minutes. The "Quick-Hot Gram Chromotrope technique" cuts down the staining time to less than 10 minutes and provides a good differentiation from the lightly stained background fecal materials so that the spores stand out for easy visualization[.18](#page-5-13) The spores stain dark violet, and the beltlike stripe is enhanced. In some cases, dark-staining gram-positive granules are also clearly seen. Chemofluorescent agents, such as calcofluor white, are also useful in the quick identification of spores in fecal smears. The spores measure 0.8 to 1.4 µm in the case of *E. bieneusi* and 1.5 to 4 µm in *A. algerae, Encephalitozoon* spp., *V. corneae,* and *Nosema* spp. If stool examination is negative in the setting of chronic diarrhea (more than 2 months' duration), endoscopy should be performed. In patients with enteric microsporidiosis undergoing endoscopy, the small intestine has provided the highest diagnostic yield, but organisms have also been seen in colonic biopsy material.

Definitive species diagnosis of microsporidiosis currently requires TEM visualization of spore ultrastructure (see [Fig. 109.3D](#page-3-0)) and developmental stages or molecular methods (PCR). TEM is expensive, time consuming, and not feasible for routine diagnosis. Species-specific rRNA primers for PCR have been described and are available in reference laboratories (e.g., Centers for Disease Control and Prevention [CDC]). Thus molecular diagnosis with

species-specific PCR primers is currently the routine standard for identification of microsporidian species in the clinical laboratory.[19](#page-6-0)

As renal involvement with shedding of spores in the urine is common in microsporidia that disseminate, urine specimens should be obtained whenever the diagnosis of microsporidiosis is considered. This has therapeutic implications, as microsporidia that disseminate (e.g., *Encephalitozoon*) are usually sensitive to albendazole, whereas those that do not disseminate (e.g., *E. bieneusi*) are resistant. In tissue sections (see [Figs. 109.2](#page-2-0) and [109.5\)](#page-4-0), touch preparations, or corneal scrapings (see [Figs. 109.3B and C](#page-3-0)), microsporidia are discernible with hematoxylin–eosin, Giemsa, tissue Gram, or Chromotrope 2R stains. Histologically, microsporidian spores are easily discernible with a modified tissue Chromotrope 2R or tissue Gram stain (Brown–Hopp or Brown–Brenn) in sections prepared from fixed tissue using routine procedures.

#### **TREATMENT ([TABLE 109.2\)](#page-4-2)**

Microsporidiosis is primarily an opportunistic infection in the immunocompromised host. Studies have demonstrated that immune reconstitution can result in clinical response in patients with microsporidiosis secondary to immune dysfunction. Immune reconstitution with cART in patients with AIDS or reversal of iatrogenic immunosuppression, when possible, is an important management principle.[2](#page-5-1)

Immune reconstitution syndrome (IRIS) has been reported in a patient with microsporidiosis treated with antiretroviral therap[y20;](#page-6-1) however, based on clinical experience, IRIS reactions are not common in this setting. Aspartyl protease inhibitors of HIV have been shown to inhibit replication of *E. intestinalis* in tissue culture.

Albendazole is a benzimidazole effective against many helminths and protozoa that inhibits microtubule assembly. Albendazole was initially shown effective in severely immunosuppressed (<50 CD4 cells/mL) patients with AIDS, with systemic disease, disseminated infection with *E. intestinalis,* and chronic diarrhea. Treatment with albendazole 400 mg twice daily resulted in a dramatic and rapid clinical resolution of diarrhea and transient elimination of the organism from feces and urine[.21](#page-6-2) In a subsequent small, randomized, double-blind, controlled trial, albendazole at 400 mg twice daily for 3 weeks led to rapid clinical improvement and elimination of

the pathogen[.22](#page-6-3) Prevention of relapse is best accomplished by immune reconstitution, but albendazole at 400 mg twice daily was shown to significantly delay relapse.[22](#page-6-3) Treatment with albendazole for intestinal disease caused by *E. bieneusi* in patients with AIDS has not proven effective. Albendazole at 400 mg twice daily for 1 month in patients with chronic diarrhea, weight loss, and malabsorption did not clear infection, although there was a statistically significant decrease in bowel movements from seven per day to four per day[.23](#page-6-4) *E. bieneusi* and *V. corneae* both have tubulin genes containing amino acid residues that are associated with resistance to albendazole.

Albendazole has also been used for the treatment of clinical syndromes caused by microsporidia other than *E. intestinalis,* although clinical trial data are lacking. Clinical and radiographic improvement was seen in a case of chronic sinusitis caused by *E. hellem* treated with albendazole 400 mg bid. Marked clinical improvement with albendazole occurred in a patient with disseminated infection caused by *E. cuniculi* involving the conjunctiva, sinuses, kidneys, and lungs. Resolution of myositis was noted in patients infected with a *Nosema*-like microsporidian and in a case of disseminated infection with myositis caused by *T. hominis* treated with albendazole. Albendazole as a systemic agent is indicated if the organism is demonstrated in the urine or in nasal smears of patients with keratoconjunctivitis.

Albendazole is recommended for the treatment of acute microsporidiosis in immunocompetent children in endemic areas and also in returning travelers. In a randomized, open study in Costa Rica, albendazole at 15 mg/kg/day twice a day for 7 days was effective in improving clinical symptoms and decreasing duration of illness from 10 days to 5 days in children ages 6 to 36 months[.24](#page-6-5) The data in returning adult travelers are less robust, but if microsporidial spores are detected in a patient with persistent diarrhea, a trial of albendazole would be indicated.[25](#page-6-6)

Fumagillin, an antibiotic derived from the fungus *Aspergillus fumigatus,* has in vitro and in vivo activity against *E. cuniculi, E. hellem, E. intestinalis, E. bieneusi, Nucleospora* (*Ent.*) *salmonis,* and *V. corneae.* Fumagillin has been demonstrated in a dose-escalation trial, case reports, and a randomized clinical trial to be effective for the treatment of human infection with *E. bieneusi* at a dose of 60 mg/day (20 mg three times daily) for 2 weeks.[26](#page-6-7) The main limiting toxicity of treatment was thrombocytopenia beginning about a week after initiation of treatment and reaching a nadir 3 days after the end of treatment. Thrombocytopenia was reversible in 1 to 2 weeks on stopping fumagillin treatment. Complete blood counts should be monitored every other day and the drug discontinued if platelet counts fall below 75,000 per cubic millimeter. Oral fumagillin at 20 mg/kg three or four times daily for 7 to 10 days is also recommended in transplant-associated microsporidiosis caused by *E. bieneusi,* although the optimal dose regimen has not been defined[.27](#page-6-8)

Solutions of the soluble salt, Fumidil B (fumagillin bicylohexylammonium), applied topically have been demonstrated to be non-toxic to the cornea and treated ocular microsporidiosis at a concentration of 3 mg/mL Fumidil B in saline (fumagillin 70 µg/ mL).[14](#page-5-9) Treatment should probably be continued indefinitely, as recurrence has been reported upon stopping the drops.

Several unreported anecdotal cases have demonstrated resolution of diarrhea caused by *E. bieneusi* in patients with organ transplantation who were treated with nitazoxanide (1000 mg bid). Several experts now consider nitazoxanide to be a reasonable alternative, if fumagillin is not available, for treatment of diarrheal syndromes caused by *E. bieneusi.* The efficacy of imidazole compounds (e.g., itraconazole) for the treatment of microsporidiosis has been variable. Medications that have not been effective in case reports and in laboratory studies for the treatment of microsporidiosis include azithromycin, metronidazole, paromomycin, sulfamethoxazole, and quinacrine. Microsporidial keratitis with and without systemic involvement is a specialized clinical manifestation that requires management in conjunction with an ophthalmologist. Topical fluoroquinolones as monotherapy or in combination with topical fumagillin, topical steroids, and systemic albendazole may all be appropriate depending on the extent of infection.[28](#page-6-9)

For a review of drugs used in microsporidiosis in humans and animals, see Costa and Weiss[.29](#page-6-10) Neither oral nor topical fumagillin is an approved drug by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA), and fumagillin is not easily available in the United States; but has been available through Sanofi-Aventis, France.

#### **PREVENTION**

As microsporidia that infect humans are likely food- or water-borne pathogens, standard sanitary measures that prevent contamination of food and water with the urine and feces of animals should decrease the chance for infection. Handwashing and general hygienic habits probably reduce the chance for contamination of the conjunctiva and cornea in contact lens wearers. The presence of infective spores in various bodily fluids suggests that universal precautions in health care settings and general attention to handwashing and other personal hygiene measures should be useful in preventing primary infections. Immunocompromised patients may wish to consider using bottled or filtered water in some settings. No prophylactic anti-parasitic agents have been identified for these organisms.
