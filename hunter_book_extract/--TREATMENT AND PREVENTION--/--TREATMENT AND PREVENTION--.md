### **TREATMENT AND PREVENTION**

There is no specific treatment for SLEV or Rocio virus infection; management of clinical illness is supportive. Interferon-α2b has been reported to reduce the severity and duration of complications from SLEV disease in some patients, but randomized controlled trials have not been conducted. Corticosteroids and intravenous immune globulin have been used on an anecdotal basis to treat SLEV disease with no clear benefit. Preventing infection through protection from mosquito bites is of primary importance.

- • Inactivated vaccines against TBEV are available.

#### **INTRODUCTION**

Arboviruses (arthropod-borne viruses) are transmitted by insects (e.g., mosquitoes and sandflies) or ticks, and the disease incidence usually follows a seasonal pattern. Arboviruses that cause encephalitis are distributed worldwide and belong to various virus families, primarily Flaviviridae, Togaviridae, Bunyaviridae, and Reoviridae*.* Several arboviruses associated with large numbers of cases of human neurologic disease (e.g., Japanese encephalitis, West Nile, St. Louis encephalitis, and the equine encephalitis viruses) are covered in previous chapters. Many others, however, have been recognized as causing sporadic human disease or small and infrequent outbreaks; these include La Crosse virus and others from the California serogroup of Bunyaviridae, other mosquito-borne and tick-borne members of the Flaviviridae family, and Bannavirus and other Reoviridae ([Table 38.7.1](#page-1-0))[.1,2](#page--1-0) In addition, several viruses have been associated with rare, unproven, or laboratory-associated cases of neuroinvasive disease, including Bunyaviridae (Bhanja, Bwamba, Erve, Inkoo, Oropouche, Tahyna, Wanowrie viruses), Flaviviridae (Kyasanur Forest disease, Langat, Omsk hemorrhagic fever viruses), Orthomyxoviridae (Thogoto virus), Reoviridae (Colorado tick fever, Eyach viruses), Rhabdoviridae (Chandipura virus), and Togaviridae (Semliki Forest virus).

#### **EPIDEMIOLOGY**

Most encephalitic arboviruses maintain cycles of transmission between birds or small mammals and arthropod vectors. Humans and domestic animals usually are infected incidentally and do not serve as a source of further vector-borne infections.

#### **Bunyaviridae**

The Bunyaviridae family includes many genera and groups. In the California serogroup, La Crosse virus (genus *Orthobunyavirus*) is endemic to the deciduous forests of rural and suburban eastern North America, where the primary vector is *Aedes triseriatus* (the eastern treehole mosquito) and the main amplifying hosts are small mammals (e.g., squirrels and chipmunks)[.3](#page--1-1) In the United States from 2007 to 2016, a median of 59 cases of La Crosse virus disease were reported annually.[4](#page--1-2) Most cases occurred in highincidence areas in upper Midwestern, mid-Atlantic, and southeastern states, and the overall case fatality was <1%. Other bunyaviruses known to cause sporadic cases of encephalitis in North America include Jamestown Canyon, snowshoe hare, and California encephalitis viruses in the California serogroup and Cache Valley virus in the Bunyamwera serogroup. In contrast to La Crosse virus, disease due to these other bunyaviruses are most commonly reported in adults. In the Phlebotomus fever serogroup, Toscana virus, vectored by *Phlebotomu*s spp. sandflies, is an important cause of summertime meningitis and, to a lesser extent, encephalitis in southern Europe from Spain to Turkey; Italy has had several

outbreaks in recent years.[5](#page--1-3) Young adults are predominately affected; fatalities are rare.

### **Flaviviridae**

In addition to mosquito-borne Japanese encephalitis, West Nile and St. Louis encephalitis viruses (discussed in other chapters), the closely related Usutu virus, transmitted by *Culex* spp. mosquitoes, has been reported to cause encephalitis in Europe[.6](#page--1-4) Murray Valley encephalitis and Kunjin viruses are mosquito-borne flaviviruses in the Japanese encephalitis serologic complex. Although both are endemic to Australia, Murray Valley encephalitis virus has also been identified in Papua New Guinea and Indonesia, and Kunjin virus in Southeast Asia. Their primary vector is *Culex annulirostris,* and they are mainly amplified in birds. Although Murray Valley encephalitis virus has caused significant epidemics of encephalitis in Australia in the past, since 1974 only sporadic cases have been reported annually.[7](#page--1-5) Kunjin virus is now classified as a strain of West Nile virus; a total of 5 to 10 sporadic cases of Kunjin virus encephalitis have been reported in Australia, including at least one laboratory-associated case.

Neurotropic tick-borne flaviviruses include tick-borne encephalitis, louping ill, and Powassan viruses. Of these closely related viruses, tick-borne encephalitis virus (TBEV) is of greatest global public health importance, averaging approximately 9000 cases reported in Europe per year. TBEV includes the European, Siberian, and Far Eastern subtypes that are transmitted to humans by *Ixodes* spp. ticks, primarily *Ix. ricinus* for the European subtype and *Ix. persulcatus* for the other two subtypes[.8](#page--1-6) Ticks act as both viral vector and reservoir, and small rodents are the main amplifying hosts. Uncommonly, infection may be acquired through consumption of unpasteurized cow, sheep, or goat milk. The incidence and severity of all three TBEV subtypes is highest in people aged >50 years. The Far Eastern subtype is generally associated with more severe human disease, a case-fatality rate of approximately 20%, and neurologic sequelae in up to 60% of survivors. The European and Siberian subtypes are generally associated with milder disease and lower case fatality (1%–3%). Louping ill virus is endemic to the United Kingdom and possibly other areas of Northern Europe. It is primarily vectored by *Ix. ricinus* and amplified in sheep. Louping ill disease mainly affects sheep, but rare, sporadic cases of human encephalitis have been described, including several in laboratory workers[.9](#page--1-7) Powassan virus disease occurs sporadically and is characterized by encephalitis that is often severe; over 50% of survivors experience long-term neurologic sequelae[.10](#page--1-8) Most cases have been reported from North America, where it is primarily vectored by *Ixodes* spp. ticks and amplified in small-to-medium-sized rodents.

#### **Reoviridae**

Banna virus (genus *Seadornavirus*) is an emerging mosquito-borne reovirus endemic to China and Southeast Asia, and has been implicated as the cause of sporadic cases of encephalitis[.11](#page--1-9) Kemerovo virus in Asia and Tribec and Lipovnik viruses in Europe are tickborne members of the genus *Orbivirus* that also have been implicated in sporadic cases of encephalitis.

#### **PATIENT EVALUATION AND DIAGNOSIS**

The encephalitic arboviruses have variable incubation periods, typically ranging from 3 to 14 days. Most infections are asymptomatic or cause mild, self-limited febrile illness; a minority of infections result in neuroinvasive disease, including meningitis, encephalitis, or myelitis.[12](#page--1-10) The severity, outcome, and sequelae vary by virus and the underlying characteristics of the host, such as age, immune status, and preexisting medical conditions. The risk of severe neurologic illness after infection is usually higher for older adults; however, for some viruses (e.g., La Crosse virus), clinical illness may be seen more often in children. The course of illness may be monophasic or biphasic. In patients with symptomatic TBEV infection, for example, the most common presentation is acute neuroinvasive disease, but patients may have milder illness, or have a brief period of recovery and then develop neuroinvasive disease. The arboviral encephalitides are generally indistinguishable from other viral encephalitides on the basis of clinical presentation or routine laboratory test results. Parenchymal central nervous system lesions may be seen on computed tomography or magnetic resonance imaging; there are no pathognomonic features, though involvement of the deep gray matter may be a clue to an arboviral etiology. Diagnosis is confirmed most frequently by measurement of virus-specific antibody in serum or cerebrospinal fluid (CSF). Acute-phase specimens should be tested for virusspecific immunoglobulin M (IgM) antibodies, which are typically detectable within the first 2 to 10 days after infection. Detecting IgM antibodies in CSF is more indicative of neuroinvasive infection than IgM antibodies in serum alone. Serum IgM persists for several months, but detection after longer periods has been documented; therefore a positive IgM test result may reflect a previous systemic infection. Serum immunoglobulin G (IgG) antibody generally is detectable shortly after IgM and persists for years. Because it passes readily through the blood–brain barrier, IgG detected in CSF is less indicative of neuroinvasive disease than IgM. Plaquereduction neutralization tests can be performed to measure virus-specific neutralizing antibodies, and may be especially useful when there are issues over cross-reactivity between related viruses. Diagnosis can also be confirmed by viral detection in serum or CSF in the first few days of illness using reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) or rarely virus isolation. However, for most encephalitic arboviral infections, humans have
