# **104.3** Cutaneous Leishmaniasis of the Old World

*Naomi E. Aronson, Alan J. Magill* [†](#page-0-0)

## **DEFINITION**

CL of the Old World is characterized by slow-to-heal ulcerative and nodular skin lesions. Uncommon syndromes in the Old World variety include diffuse CL, ML, and leishmaniasis recidivans. Local names for this disease include Oriental sore, Baghdad boil, Delhi boil, Biskra button, and Aleppo evil.

# **ETIOLOGY**

Most Old World CL is caused by infections with *L. tropica* and *L. major* and, less commonly, with *L. aethiopica, L. infantum,* and *L. killicki* (these are often geographically focal diseases).

# **DISTRIBUTION AND EPIDEMIOLOGY**

The geographic distribution of Old World CL is shown in [Fig.](#page-0-1) [104.3.1A](#page-0-1). Old World CL usually occurs in semi-arid or desert ecologic zones. In established transmission foci, CL is a childhood disease with increasing prevalence with age to about the midteenage years. Adults have acquired immunity and are seldom affected. In newly emerging foci, all individuals are non-immune, and significant epidemics with very high attack rates are common.

## *Leishmania major*

*L. major* is a zoonotic infection of desert rodents with humans infected as incidental hosts. The great gerbil (*Rhombomys opimus*) lives in dry desert areas of central Asia, in southern Russia, throughout Iran and Pakistan, and in parts of Iraq and northwestern India and China. Other rodents in these areas play a secondary role in maintaining the infection. In North Africa, Saudi Arabia, and Israel, the fat desert gerbil *(Psammomys obesus)* and other rodents

(*Meriones* spp.) are important reservoir hosts. Inhabitants of villages near gerbil burrows may have infection prevalence rates of 100%, and others who enter the ecosystem, for example, travelers, hunters, and military personnel, may also experience high attack rates. The peak incidence of CL infection occurs from June to October, with lesions appearing in October to March. Most children in endemic areas acquire a sore between 2 and 3 years of age, rarely reaching maturity without a scar. CL caused by *L. major* is also found sporadically in a wide area of sub-Saharan Africa where the Nile rat *(Arvicanthis niloticus)* is a major reservoir host, although infection has been demonstrated in other rodents.

# *Leishmania tropica*

*L. tropica* is a very heterogeneous species complex with strains that can be distinguished on ecologic, biochemical, and genomic grounds. Zoonotic *L. tropica* is a parasite of dogs and rodents and is associated with rural disease. Anthroponotic *L. tropica* is a parasite of humans and occurs in urban environments. It is found in northwestern India, Iraq, Iran, southern Italy, Greece, Pakistan, and the Syrian Arab Republic. With residual insecticide spraying for malaria control, there was a marked decrease in the sandfly populations and concomitant decline in the incidence of urban CL. However, a major epidemic of anthroponotic CL caused by *L. tropica* has occurred in war-ravaged Kabul, Afghanistan, with thousands of cases identified.[1](#page--1-0)

# *Leishmania aethiopica*

*L. aethiopica* is a zoonotic parasite found in stable, low-endemicity foci in mountain valleys of the Rift Valley of Ethiopia and Kenya. The mammalian reservoir is the rock hyrax *(Procavia habessinica)* and the tree hyrax *(Heterohyrax brucei),* with the high-altitude sandfly vectors *P. longipes* (Ethiopia) and *P. pedifer* (Kenya). Human cases are closely associated with proximity to hyrax colonies and often occur when homesteads encroach on the zoonotic cycle on deforested mountain slopes[.2](#page--1-1)

## *Leishmania infantum (syn. L. chagasi)*

*L. infantum,* the usual cause of Mediterranean VL, has been isolated from indurated, nodular cutaneous lesions acquired in countries throughout the Mediterranean littoral, Iran, the Caucasus, and foci in the New World.[3](#page--1-2) Isoenzyme analysis shows that "dermotropic" *L. infantum* strains are more commonly found in cutaneous lesions.

# **PATHOGENESIS**

The development of clinical disease after infection depends on the parasite strain and inoculum, the genetically determined host innate and acquired immune responses, prior exposures, and sandfly factors to include immunity to components of the saliva.[4](#page--1-3) The host inflammatory responses mediate disease expression, resulting in asymptomatic infection to predominantly self-healing ulcerative CL or chronic, non-healing diffuse CL, ML, or leishmaniasis recidivans. In general, disease resolution is mediated by CMI. In leishmaniasis recidivans, in peripheral lesions around a healed scar, a granulomatous reaction without caseation is seen with scanty parasites. In diffuse CL, there is a defect in the CMI response and numerous macrophages filled with amastigotes are seen with little cellular reaction.

# <span id="page-1-0"></span>**CLINICAL MANIFESTATIONS**

The incubation period of CL is generally 2 to 8 weeks, but in exceptional cases, the incubation period may be as long as 3 years. The first sign of CL is often an inflammatory papule at the site of the sandfly bite. It may persist as a flattened plaque or may progress to a nodule after a few days or weeks that may be covered with dry scale covering a shallow ulcer. As the ulcer enlarges, it oozes serous fluid and may become covered with a thick crust. A raised, indurated area with a characteristic discoloration surrounds the edge of the ulcer. Satellite lesions are common and may ultimately merge with the parent lesion. Over many weeks to months the typical features of ulcerative CL emerge[.5](#page--1-4)

Lesions usually occur on exposed parts of the body, for example, the face, hands, feet, arms, and legs, but rarely on the trunk and never on the palms or soles or hairy scalp. Uncommon sites of ulcers include the ears, tongue, and eyelids. Lymphatic spread may occur in *L. major* infections, with subcutaneous nodules in a linear distribution and regional lymphadenopathy.

Different forms of CL vary in some of their clinical features. The lesions caused by *L. major* tend to be larger, multiple, and can be accompanied by marked inflammation and crusting [\(Fig.](#page-1-0) [104.3.2](#page-1-0)). They mature rapidly and heal relatively quickly, lasting a few months. The lesions caused by *L. tropica* tend to be smaller, fewer, develop more slowly, and persist for a year or more. The lesions caused by *L. infantum (syn. L. chagasi)* tend to be small and nodular [\(Fig. 104.3.3\)](#page-2-0).

CL lesions caused by *L. aethiopica* are the least inflamed and most chronic; most lesions eventually heal spontaneously within 2 to 5 years. *L. aethiopica* gives rise principally to localized cutaneous nodular lesions; less frequently, it gives rise to oronasal leishmaniasis, which may distort the nostrils and lips, and a small percentage of infected individuals develop non-healing diffuse CL (see [Fig.](#page-2-1) [104.3.5](#page-2-1)). In diffuse CL, ulceration is late or absent.

# **Leishmaniasis Recidivans**

Leishmaniasis recidivans is a rare chronic form of CL caused by *L. tropica,* which is found primarily in Southwest Asia and North Africa. This clinical manifestation usually begins on the face (95%),

<span id="page-2-0"></span>slowly progresses, advancing at the periphery of a scar, and is characterized by the development of recrudescing lupoid papules or nodules that form mostly around or in the site of primary healed lesions ([Fig. 104.3.4\)](#page-2-2). Lesions spread slowly, may persist for 20 to 40 years, and are challenging to treat, thus becoming destructive and disfiguring over the years. The scarcity of amastigotes in direct smears and tissue specimens from the lesions easily leads to misdiagnosis of lupus vulgaris (cutaneous tuberculosis), both clinically and histologically.

# **Diffuse Cutaneous Leishmaniasis**

Diffuse CL is an uncommon infection with *L. aethiopica* in Ethiopia and Kenya. Diffuse CL usually begins as a single, nodular, nonulcerating lesion (often on the face), which enlarges and is followed by multiple, widely disseminated cutaneous macules, papules, nodules, or plaques, or by diffuse infiltration of the skin (especially on extensor surfaces of the limbs and on the face), resulting in lesions scattered over the entire body (especially on the face and nose, limbs, and buttocks), where thickening of the eyebrows and earlobes may resemble lepromatous leprosy ([Fig. 104.3.5](#page-2-1))[.6](#page--1-5) The lesions do not ulcerate and may coalesce to form plaques. This disease does not heal spontaneously, and relapses are frequent after treatment.

# **DIAGNOSIS**

## **Demonstration of the Organism**

Typical ulcerative lesions should be thoroughly cleaned, lesions anesthetized with lidocaine–epinephrine (no epinephrine on digits, genital area, or areas of potential vascular compromise), and a portion of the exudative crust debrided to the ulcer base. Using a No. 10 scalpel blade, one can superficially scrape the clean surface of an ulcer multiple times to obtain a sample about the size of a rice grain: smear on glass slides for staining and microscopic diagnosis; place another sample in culture media if you wish to

determine species; and place the last scraping sample in 95% ethanol for DNA or RNA extraction for PCR testing. Tissue fluid aspirated from the indurated margin of lesions can also be cultured or used for PCR testing. Cultures generally become positive within 2 to 7 days in Schneider's medium but may take longer (up to 21 days) to grow in NNN medium.

In nodular lesions amastigotes can sometimes be identified in slit skin smears from the indurated lesions prepared as for diagnosing leprosy. Alternatively, an aspirate can be performed or a small biopsy specimen may be removed from the edge of the lesion and an impression smear made by pressing the cut surface lightly against a slide. A portion of the biopsy specimen is macerated and cultured in NNN or Schneider's medium, some placed in 95% ethanol for PCR, and the remainder formalin-fixed for histopathologic examination.

# **Serologic Tests**

Low titers of anti-leishmanial antibodies are detected in many patients with CL, but available serologic tests are generally of little diagnostic help.

# **Differential Diagnosis**

The lesions of CL must be distinguished from pyoderma, cutaneous myiasis, rickettsial eschar, tropical ulcer, tertiary syphilis, yaws, lupus vulgaris, blastomycosis, sporotrichosis, chromomycosis, cutaneous actinomycosis, pyoderma gangrenosum, spider bites, fixed drug eruptions, lichen simplex chronicus, basal cell carcinoma, squamous cell carcinoma, and other causes of chronic nodules and ulcers. Definitive diagnosis depends on the demonstration or isolation of the organism.

## **TREATMENT**

Detailed clinical practice guidelines for the diagnosis and treatment of leishmaniasis have been published by the Infectious Diseases Society of America and the American Society of Tropical Medicine and Hygiene. These can be found at [https://www.idsociety.org/](https://www.idsociety.org/practice-guideline/leishmaniasis/) [practice-guideline/leishmaniasis/.](https://www.idsociety.org/practice-guideline/leishmaniasis/)

## **Old World Cutaneous Leishmaniasis**

The majority of Old World CL lesions, especially CL caused by *L. major,* are self-healing, requiring months (average 4–6) to heal completely. CL caused by *L. tropica* can take many months or a few years to heal. In general, systemic treatment is less commonly employed in Old World disease compared with New World disease, mainly because there are rarely associated metastatic complications in the immune-competent host. There are few data from highquality clinical treatment trials in Old World CL.[7,8](#page--1-6)

## **Local Therapy**

Local treatments include thermotherapy, cryotherapy, photodynamic therapy, topical paromomycin ointments or cream, intralesional administration of SbV, and combinations of all of the these.

Local heat therapy is useful in treating small or moderate-sized lesions (<25 mm). One or two sessions of localized heat (50°C for 30 seconds) covering the lesions using the ThermoMed device (Thermosurgery, Inc., Phoenix, AZ) was as effective as intralesional SbV (70% cure rate) in *L. tropica* acquired in Afghanistan[,9](#page--1-7) and showed similar efficacy to ten days of systemic SbV in *L. major* acquired in Iraq[.10](#page--1-8) The device is battery powered—a significant advantage for field use—but a plan for antimicrobial decontamination of the prongs between patients must be implemented. This device is FDA cleared for the treatment of CL. Local anesthesia must be applied to the lesion before using the device. A blister is often seen 1 to 2 days after thermotherapy but appears to be well tolerated. Application of a topical antibiotic ointment and wound care decrease the incidence of secondary wound infections.

Cryotherapy is achieved with application of liquid nitrogen every 3 to 7 days (although some prefer to space this out by 2 weeks) for one to five sessions. Each weekly administration is usually two application cycles of 10 to 15 seconds of freezing time, with a thawing interval of 20 seconds. Freezing should reach into a few millimeters of healthy-appearing skin surrounding the lesion. Liquid nitrogen application requires specific devices and a skilled health care provider. Post-cryotherapy care includes daily cleansing and topical application of antibiotic ointment.

Topical paromomycin creams and ointments at various doses, regimens, and formulations have been used for decades. A topical formulation of 15% paromomycin with 12% methyl benzethonium chloride in soft white paraffin (Leshcutan, Teva, Israel) gives variable responses in *L. major* ranging from 30% to 75% and has poor efficacy in *L. tropica.*[11](#page--1-9) Because this preparation causes significant local reactions consisting of pruritus, paresthesias, and vesicle formation in about 25% of patients, other, better-tolerated preparations have been developed. A longer regimen (up to 12 weeks) of 12% to 15% paromomycin/10% urea applied daily cured 23 out of 27 patients in London in a mean time of 6.7 weeks and was reported as non-toxic.[12](#page--1-10) None of the topical ointments are effective against CL caused by *L. tropica.* A formulation of 15% paromomycin and 0.5% gentamicin cream was shown to be superior to placebo in *L. major* acquired in Tunisia and was safe and well tolerated[.13](#page--1-11) Although the next generation of paromomycin-based topicals appears quite promising, the best formulation and optimal dose regimen are not yet determined.

Intralesional SbV, defined as local dermal infiltration of 0.2 to 0.8 mL of undiluted SbV into multiple injection sites in the lesion, often repeated every 3 to 7 days (some prefer spacing out to every 2–3 weeks) until healed, has been used extensively for Old World CL with success.[14](#page--1-12) Intralesional SbV can be painful, depending on the location injected, but avoids systemic toxicity and reduces cost. Combinations of intralesional SbV co-administered with cryotherapy have been shown to be superior to either therapy alone.[15](#page--1-13)

## **Systemic Therapy**

Systemic treatment is indicated for large or multiple lesions and for patients with lesions in functionally or cosmetically important areas—for example, the wrist, feet, ankles, or face (eyelids, ear, lips)—when local treatments are not indicated. SbV can be given intramuscularly or intravenously at 20 mg SbV/kg/day for 10 to 20 days. CL caused by *L. tropica* and *L. aethiopica* usually requires a longer treatment duration, whereas CL caused by *L. major* may be adequately treated with the shorter 10-day regimen[.10,16](#page--1-8)

Oral fluconazole at 200 mg daily for 6 weeks was shown to shorten the time to healing in *L. major* infections in Saudi Arabia compared with placebo[.17](#page--1-14) Another randomized controlled trial in patients with *L. major* in Iran showed that a higher fluconazole dose of 400 mg was superior to the 200-mg dose in complete healing at 6 weeks: 81% versus 48%.[18](#page--1-15) The optimal dosing of fluconazole remains to be determined, and the observed efficacy is modest; in a recent meta-analysis the overall efficacy for azole treatment of *L. major* infection was 44% and 15% for *L. tropica.*[19,20](#page--1-16)

## Leishmaniasis Recidivans

The World Health Organization (WHO)–recommended treatment for leishmaniasis recidivans caused by *L. tropica* is 15 to 20 mg SbV/kg per day intramuscularly or intravenously for 15 days plus oral allopurinol 20 mg/kg for 30 days.[80](#page--1-17) Pragmatically other therapies are tried, including miltefosine, L-amB, and combination treatments.[21](#page--1-18)
