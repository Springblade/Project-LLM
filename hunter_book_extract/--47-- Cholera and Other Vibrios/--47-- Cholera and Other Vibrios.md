*Ana A. Weil, Regina C. LaRocque*

# KEY FEATURES

- • *Vibrio* species are environmental organisms that are found in freshwater and marine water habitats around the world.
- • Cholera is caused by *Vibrio cholerae* O1 and O139 strains that carry the genes encoding cholera toxin.
- • Due to rapid spread of disease, immediate recognition of outbreaks is critical.
- • Cholera is spread by contaminated water and food.
- • Vaccination is an increasingly accepted method of preventing disease in epidemics.
- • Cholera is endemic in over 50 countries and regularly causes outbreaks and epidemics in these settings.
- • Treatment of cholera is inexpensive, simple, and lifesaving.
- • Other *Vibrio* species ("non-cholera" *Vibrios*) are less common pathogens and may cause septicemia, soft tissue infection, and gastrointestinal illness.

#### *VIBRIO CHOLERAE*

## **Introduction**

Historically, cholera is one of the great scourges of mankind. Seven global pandemics have occurred since the early 19th century[.1](#page-5-0) The current seventh global pandemic of cholera, caused by *Vibrio cholerae* O1 biotype El Tor, began in Sulawesi, Indonesia, in 1961.

The history of cholera is closely tied to the history of medicine. In 1854 John Snow made the seminal observation that sewagecontaminated municipal water was the source of cholera in a London community, introducing a concept in the germ theory of disease. Robert Koch isolated the causative bacterium during the fifth pandemic in 1883. Oral rehydration solution (ORS), originally developed for the treatment of cholera, has saved millions of lives and is one of the landmark medical achievements of the 20th century.

# **Epidemiology**

Today, cholera remains a significant health burden in the developing world. The disease is endemic in Africa, Asia, Central and South America, and now Haiti[.2](#page-5-1) The Ganges River Delta is the ancestral epicenter of cholera ("Asiatic cholera"), and predictable seasonal outbreaks occur in this region. Explosive epidemics can occur in areas with limited access to clean drinking water. In Haiti in 2010, cholera was introduced by a carrier from an endemic country, resulting in a deadly outbreak and establishment of endemic cholera on the island[.3](#page-5-2)

Precise estimates of global cholera incidence are lacking; limitations in local surveillance and reporting systems and economic disincentives contribute to the global underreporting of cholera. [Fig. 47.1](#page-1-0) shows the global distribution of cholera based on cases reported to the World Health Organization (WHO) in 2016.

In endemic areas, cholera exhibits a seasonal pattern with periods of high and low incidence. Risk factors for severe disease (cholera gravis) include younger age, lack of pre-existing immunity, and blood group O status[.4](#page-5-3)

# **Natural History, Pathogenesis, and Pathology**

*Vibrios* are curved, rod-shaped, gram-negative bacteria that are highly motile due to the presence of a single polar flagellum. They are found in brackish water environments around the world, often closely associated with zooplankton and other fauna with chitinous exoskeletons[.5](#page-5-4) Humans become infected after drinking contaminated water ([Fig. 47.2](#page-2-0)). An extremely high concentration of organisms (up to 100 million bacteria per milliliter) is found in cholera stool. Stool-shed organisms are transiently hyperinfectious, and this adaptation may contribute to the explosive nature of cholera epidemics[.6](#page-5-5)

Strains of *V. cholerae* are differentiated serologically by the lipopolysaccharide O antigen. To date, more than 200 serogroups have been identified. Historically, the O1 serogroup has caused the vast majority of disease and is divided into several phenotypically distinct biotypes: El Tor and classical are the most common. Both biotypes can be further subdivided into two serotypes: Inaba and Ogawa. In the past 25 years, the El Tor biotype has largely replaced the classical biotype and is the cause of the current seventh global pandemic. The O139 serogroup emerged as a cause of disease in 1992 but has remained limited to areas of Asia.

Pathogenic strains of *V. cholerae* possess two key virulence factors—cholera toxin and the toxin co-regulated pilus (TCP). TCP is a surface pilus that aggregates organisms together on the surface of the small intestine. Cholera toxin is a prototypical AB subunit toxin. The B subunit binds the toxin to the surface of epithelial cells, while the enzymatically active A subunit is translocated into the cell. The A subunit increases cyclic AMP activity, leading to the massive fluid and electrolyte efflux resulting in diarrhea that is the hallmark of the disease.

#### **Clinical Features**

*V. cholerae* incubation period varies with host susceptibility and inoculum size, and ranges from several hours to 3 to 5 days. Most cases are mild or asymptomatic, especially in endemic settings. In severe cholera, the characteristic symptom is the frequent passage of profuse "rice-water" stool [\(Fig. 47.3\)](#page-3-0)—a watery stool with flecks of mucus and a typical fishy odor. Stool output can reach as high as 1 liter per hour in severe cases. Abdominal discomfort, lethargy, and vomiting are other common symptoms, particularly in the early phases of disease; fever is rare.

Examination may reveal sunken eyes ([Fig. 47.4\)](#page-3-1), dry mouth, cold clammy skin, decreased skin turgor, or wrinkled hands and feet. Dehydration and electrolyte abnormalities are important complications of cholera. Kussmaul breathing may occur as a result of acidosis, and muscle cramping and weakness can occur due to loss of potassium and calcium. The peripheral pulse is rapid and initially thready; it may become difficult to palpate as blood pressure drops. Urine output decreases with time, and renal failure due to hypovolemia or acute tubular necrosis may occur. In children, depletion of glycogen stores and inadequate gluconeogenesis can lead to severe hypoglycemia and coma. Bloodstream invasion by the organism is extremely rare. Laboratory testing of

cholera patients, when performed, may reveal hypokalemia, hyponatremia, hypocalcemia, and acidosis.

"Cholera sicca" is an unusual form of the disease whereby fluid accumulates in the intestinal lumen. Circulatory collapse and even death can occur in the absence of diarrhea.

# **Patient Evaluation, Diagnosis, and Differential Diagnosis**

Cholera often occurs in outbreaks, and the diagnosis should be quickly suspected in areas of poor sanitation when adults or children over 5 years of age develop acute watery diarrhea resulting in profound dehydration. Mild-to-moderate cases of *V. cholerae* may be indistinguishable from infection with other pathogens, such as enterotoxigenic *Escherichia coli, Campylobacter* spp., or *Salmonella* spp.

*V. cholerae* O1 or O139 infection is confirmed by the isolation of the organism in stool culture, followed by biochemical tests and serogrouping with specific antisera. Thiosulfate citrate bile salts sucrose agar or tellurite taurocholate gelatin agar are used for the selective isolation. An immediate diagnosis of cholera can be made using a rapid dipstick test (Crystal VC, Span Diagnostics), which has excellent sensitivity but a specificity between 65% and 85% in field settings. Cholera can be rapidly diagnosed using direct dark-field microscopy of stool where motile *Vibrio* organisms appear like "shooting stars."

#### **Treatment**

Treatment of cholera is simple and inexpensive, and when appropriately treated the case fatality rate approaches zero. Most importantly, the fluid deficit and ongoing fluid loss must be corrected. Antibiotics can be administered to decrease the duration of illness and bacterial shedding, thereby reducing health care service utilization and potentially transmission of disease. Complications such as pneumonia and hypoglycemia in children must be recognized and addressed in a timely manner.

# Correction of Fluid Loss

Correction of dehydration through fluid replacement and maintenance remains the cornerstone of cholera treatment. A cholera patient can lose more than 5% to 10% of their body weight in fluid during the course of the illness. The amount of fluid therapy administered is determined by assessing the level of dehydration ([Table 47.1](#page-1-1) and [Fig. 47.5\)](#page-4-0). Fluid replacement occurs in two phases. In the *rescue phase,* aggressive fluid replacement is given to replenish the fluid deficit in a period of 3 to 4 hours.[7](#page-5-6) Intravenous fluids should be

used for rehydration in cases of severe dehydration, mental status changes with inability to drink, hypovolemic shock, and profuse vomiting. After resuscitation for fluid loss, ongoing assessment of fluid loss is necessary, and stool output should be measured every 4 to 6 hours. Such measurement can be facilitated using a cholera cot (a simple plastic cot with a central hole to facilitate collection of stool in a bucket). In the *maintenance phase*, intravenous fluid or ORS is given to replenish ongoing fluid losses. Intravenous and oral rehydration fluids are designed to correct the water and electrolyte loss in cholera stool ([Table 47.2](#page-3-2)). The most commonly used intravenous solution is commercially available Ringer's lactate, <span id="page-2-0"></span>or locally prepared fluid which contains more potassium than Ringer's lactate can be used in endemic countries.

The use of ORS, a readily prepared sugar and salt solution, has revolutionized the treatment of cholera and dehydration caused by other infections[.8](#page-5-7) ORS takes advantage of the fact that glucosemediated co-transport of sodium and water across the mucosal surface of the small intestine remains intact during diarrhea. Hypo-osmolar ORS [\(Box 47.1\)](#page-3-3) is currently recommended by the WHO.

Packets for the easy preparation of ORS are widely available in developing countries. If ORS packets are not available,

*ORS*, Oral rehydration solution.

dehydration can be treated with a solution made with six level teaspoons of sugar and one-half level teaspoon of salt dissolved in one liter of clean water.

Apart from fluid replacement, the intake of freshly prepared food is encouraged when tolerated, and breastfeeding should be continued where appropriate. For children up to 5 years of age, supplementary administration of zinc (10 mg/day × 2 weeks in children <6 months; 20 mg/day × 2 weeks in children 6 months to 5 years) has proven effective in reducing the duration of diarrhea, as well as reducing successive diarrhea episodes[.9](#page-5-9)

#### Antibiotics

Antimicrobial therapy is an adjunct to fluid therapy in cholera and has been shown to reduce the duration and volume of diarrheal stool and reduce bacterial shedding[.10](#page-5-10) The WHO advocates the use of antibiotics for individuals with severe dehydration, basing choice on local availability and susceptibility pattern[.7](#page-5-6) A wide range of antibiotics, both in single- and multiple-dose regimens, is used for the treatment of cholera, as shown in [Table 47.3.](#page-4-1) <span id="page-3-1"></span>Resistance of *V. cholerae* O1 and O139 to many commonly used antibiotics is an emerging problem, and thus knowledge of the local resistance pattern is mandatory. Single-dose regimens are preferred in outbreak settings where health care personnel are scarce.

#### **Prevention and Vaccines**

A clean water supply is essential to the prevention of cholera, and breastfeeding is protective for young infants in endemic settings. Three oral, whole-cell, killed cholera vaccines are now pre-qualified by the WHO and are available in various countries. The WHO recommends use of cholera vaccines in areas of known cholera epidemics and areas at high risk of outbreaks, in conjunction with improved water supplies, adequate sanitation, and health education,[11](#page-5-11) and observational data suggest vaccination in epidemic settings is also valuable.[12](#page-5-12) Oral cholera vaccines have recently been deployed to prevent epidemics and are increasingly used for this purpose[.13](#page-5-13) In 2017 the WHO introduced a global strategy to reduce cholera deaths by 90% by the year 2030[.14](#page-5-14)

## **OTHER** *VIBRIOS*

#### *Vibrio parahaemolyticus*

<span id="page-4-2"></span>\*Not to exceed adult dose.

*V. parahaemolyticus* is the most commonly isolated non-cholera *Vibrio*. Like *V. cholerae,* it is found in marine environments. *V. parahaemolyticus* causes gastroenteritis as a result of consumption of raw or partially cooked food, particularly seafood. *V. parahaemolyticus* accounts for a large proportion of food-borne illness in Japan, where consumption of seafood is common. The incubation period for *V. parahaemolyticus* ranges from 4 to 48 hours. Clinical illness tends to be mild, with gastroenteritis symptoms including nausea, vomiting, abdominal pain, and diarrhea. The disease is usually self-limiting. Oral rehydration is typically adequate for treatment, and tetracycline or ciprofloxacin can be administered in severe cases.

# *Vibrio vulnificus*

*Vibrio* species have been isolated from wounds exposed to seawater. *V. vulnificus* is a particularly important pathogen in *Vibrio*-associated soft tissue infections and sepsis. Immunocompromised individuals and those with underlying liver disease are especially prone to septicemia with *V. vulnificus.* Thrombocytopenia and disseminated intravascular coagulation are common, along with characteristic bullous skin lesions. The mortality rate is greater than 50% if the infection is not promptly treated. Tetracycline appears to be effective in conjunction with other supportive treatments. In severe infection, tissue debridement and amputation of the affected limb may be required.
