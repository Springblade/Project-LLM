weeks, but more severe cases require months or years to resolve entirely.[10](#page-1-1) One study indicated that one third of patients had chronic joint symptoms that persisted for at least 9 months.[11](#page-1-2) Cutaneous manifestations are typical with many patients. This is usually a maculopapular rash, but bullous lesions can occur in infants. The trunk and limbs are most commonly involved, but the face, palms, and soles may also show lesions. During the acute phase, some patients will have headache, but it is not usually severe, and retro-orbital pain, commonly found in dengue infections, rarely occurs. Conjunctival redness is present in some cases. Pregnant women can pass the virus to their infant, most commonly during the intrapartum phase. The Reunion South Hospital Group observed 84 pregnant women who had laboratory-confirmed CHIK infection. In 88% of these women (all involving infections relatively distant from delivery), the newborns appeared asymptomatic. Conversely, 10 newborns developed disease soon after birth (4 with meningoencephalitis and 3 with intravascular coagulation) and required intensive care support[.12](#page-1-3) Severe cases of CHIK, including neurologic complications, myocarditis, or nephritis, can occur, most commonly in the elderly, newborns, and immunocompromised individuals.[13,14](#page-1-4) CHIK outbreaks typically result in several hundred or thousands of cases, but deaths are rarely encountered.

## **DIAGNOSIS**

Symptoms of CHIKV infection can be clinically indistinguishable from dengue fever. Other causes in the differential diagnosis of CHIK include malaria, O'nyong nyong, Sindbis, Ross River, West Nile, and Zika virus infections[.9,15,16](#page-1-0)

The clinical laboratory findings in CHIK are not remarkable. A few patients may present with leukopenia with relative lymphocytosis; however, most patients will have normal blood counts. The platelet count may be moderately depressed. The erythrocyte sedimentation rate and C-reactive protein levels are typically elevated in acute cases[.15](#page-1-5) A definitive diagnosis can only be made by laboratory testing, but CHIK should be suspected when epidemic disease occurs with the characteristic triad of fever, rash, and arthralgia.

Virus-specific IgM antibodies typically can be detected by 5 to 7 days of illness using enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA). Because viremia is so high and persists for several days post-illness onset, blood samples for virus isolation and reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) should be collected within the first 5 days of illness when viremia is detectable. Frequently, diagnosis can be definitively confirmed by virus isolation or molecular techniques such as RT-PCR, for which a wide range of tests now exist[.17](#page-1-6)

## **TREATMENT**

There is no specific treatment for CHIK. The illness is usually self-limiting and resolves with time. Supportive care with rest is

Aspirin and other nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) are recommended for chronic pain. A number of therapeutic options are in development, as are several vaccine candidates[.18](#page-1-7)

Because no vaccine or specific medication is yet available against CHIKV infection, vector control is very important in controlling or preventing transmission. Elimination of breeding sites or source reduction is an important control approach. *A. aegypti* is typically a container-habitat species [\(Fig. 36.2.4](#page-1-8)) and breeds primarily in artificial containers and receptacles. Therefore all water tanks, cisterns, barrels, trash containers, etc., need to be covered tightly with a lid. Old tires, tin cans, buckets, drums, bottles, etc., should be removed, as mosquitoes may breed in these containers if they accumulate water. In ornamental garden water tanks, larvivorous fish (e.g*.*, gambusia, guppy) can be introduced. In case water containers cannot be emptied on a daily or weekly basis, larvicidal treatments can be applied[.19](#page-1-9)

Both primary vectors, *A. aegypti* and *A. albopictus,* are principally daytime biters. Insect repellant containing *N,N*-diethyl-m-toluamide (DEET) or another registered active ingredient should be applied on exposed skin ([Table 36.2.1](#page-1-10)). People should be advised to wear long sleeves and pants and have secure screens on windows and doors to keep mosquitoes out. Insecticide-treated bed net use during daytime resting can help prevent mosquito bites. Infected persons should be protected from further mosquito exposure (staying indoors and/or under a mosquito net during the first few days of illness) so that they cannot contribute to the transmission cycle.
