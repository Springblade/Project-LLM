# **128** Liver Fluke Infections

*Kittiyod Poovorawan, Yupaporn Wattanagoon*

### KEY FEATURES

- • The major flukes causing liver infection are *Opisthorchis* spp*.*, *Clonorchis sinensis,* and *Fasciola* spp*.*
- • *C. sinensis* is limited to East and Southeast Asia, *O. viverrini* to Southeast Asia, and *O. felineus* is widely distributed in Eastern Europe. *Fasciola* spp*.* occurs in many countries of the world.
- • Opisthorchiasis and clonorchiasis are acquired through ingestion of raw or undercooked cyprinid fish containing infective metacercariae, and fascioliasis is acquired through eating freshwater plants with encysted metacercariae. Herbivorous animals are the usual hosts of *Fasciola* spp*.*
- • *Clonorchis* and *Opisthorchis* spp. reside in the biliary tree,

- and chronic infection with these species is strongly associated with cholangiocarcinoma.
- • Symptoms of fascioliasis usually occur during migration of the fluke through liver parenchyma or during ectopic migration.
- • Detection of characteristic ova in stool is the usual mode of diagnosis. Serologic test or molecular technique may be useful for epidemiologic survey.
- • Treatment of opisthorchiasis and clonorchiasis is usually with praziquantel, whereas fascioliasis should be treated with triclabendazole.

## **128.1** Opisthorchiasis and Clonorchiasis

*Kittiyod Poovorawan, Yupaporn Wattanagoon*

#### **INTRODUCTION**

Opisthorchiasis and clonorchiasis are caused by liver flukes in the family Opisthorchiadae*.* The three most common species causing disease in humans are *Opisthorchis viverrini, O. felineus,* and *Clonorchis sinensis.*

#### **EPIDEMIOLOGY**

*O. viverrini* is endemic in Southeast Asia, mainly Thailand, Lao People's Democratic Republic, the southern part of Vietnam, and Cambodia. The prevalence in northeastern Thailand was as high as 90% during the 1980s and remains around 20%, despite control measures. *O. felineus* is endemic in Russia and Eastern Europe, and *C. sinensis* is common in Korea, China, and northern Vietnam. In endemic areas, children as young as 1 year old have been infected with *O. viverrini.*

#### **NATURAL HISTORY, PATHOGENESIS, AND PATHOLOGY**

Humans are an incidental host of *O. viverrini, O. felineus,* and *C. sinensis.* Consumption of raw or undercooked cyprinid fish (e.g., carp) containing metacercaria—the infective stage of these flukes—results in infection. The metacercaria, released in the intestine, move through the ampulla of Vater into the common bile duct to the gallbladder and the peripheral bile ducts in the liver, where they develop into adult worms ([Fig. 128.1.1](#page-1-0)). Adult worms release eggs that are passed in the feces. In freshwater, the eggs hatch and release miracidia that are taken up by snails where parasite amplification occurs. Cercariae emerge from snails and infect susceptible freshwater fish, encysting as metacercariae.

The presence of adult worms in the bile duct causes chronic irritation; the worms also release toxic metabolic substances. The immune response leads to infiltration with eosinophils and mononuclear cells in periductal areas; secondary bacterial infections can occur. There is bile duct epithelial cell desquamation and hyperplasia and glandular proliferation ([Fig. 128.1.2](#page-1-1)). Intrahepatic bile ducts become dilated with distal clubbing and cystic changes. The gallbladder can be dilated with hypertrophic epithelial cells and can contain whitish bile[.1](#page--1-0) Severity of pathology depends on both intensity and duration of infection. Chronic changes lead to fibrosis and when combined with endogenous and exogenous carcinogens, notably nitrosamines, induce mutagenic changes in the bile duct epithelium that can lead to cholangiocarcinoma.

#### **CLINICAL FEATURES**

Acute symptoms are more common with *C. sinensis* and *O. felineus* and are rare with *O. viverrini.* High fever, arthralgia, myalgia, lymph node enlargement, eosinophilia, and, occasionally, facial edema can occur after 2 to 3 weeks of infection during worm migration and development[.2](#page--1-1) As the worms are not yet mature, ova will not be detected in the feces at this stage. Illness usually lasts for 1 to 2 weeks. Allergic hepatitis is occasionally observed, especially in severe cases.

Chronic infections are usually asymptomatic and are detected by routine stool examination. In symptomatic cases, non-specific symptoms, such as lassitude, anorexia, flatulence, abdominal discomfort, poor appetite, and occasional loose stools, are common. A peculiar hot sensation over the right upper abdomen is characteristic in *O. viverrini* infection. Low-grade fever and hepatomegaly also occur[.3](#page--1-2)

Complications such as relapsing cholangitis or abscess caused by secondary bacterial infections are common in advanced disease. Patients present with fever, jaundice, and abdominal pain with hepatomegaly and an enlarged gallbladder. Oriental

<span id="page-1-1"></span>cholangiohepatitis has been reported to be associated with *C. sinensis* [\(Fig. 128.1.3\)](#page-1-2).[4](#page--1-3)

Cholangiocarcinoma is highly associated with *Opisthorchis* and *Clonorchis* infection[,5](#page--1-4) especially when combined with consumption of a diet high in nitrosamines; hamsters infected with *O. viverrini* developed cholangiocarcinoma when fed a high-nitrosamine diet[.6](#page--1-5) *O. viverrini* secrete granulin-like growth factor, Ov-GRN-1. This protein accelerates wound healing and blood vessel growth in cholangiocytes and is associated with cancer pathways[.7](#page--1-6)

### **PATIENT EVALUATION AND DIFFERENTIAL DIAGNOSIS**

As patients with early or mild infection can be asymptomatic, diagnosis usually relies on routine stool examination. People in endemic areas who eat uncooked fish and have non-specific abdominal symptoms should have yearly stool examinations for *Opisthorchis* or *Clonorchis* ova. However, these ova can be difficult to differentiate from flukes present in the small intestine. Patients

Acute opisthorchiasis or clonorchiasis is differentiated from acute fascioliasis, acute schistosomiasis, and other tissue parasites by exposure history and epidemiology.

In late-stage disease, patients can present with obstructive jaundice, cholangitis, or cholangiocarcinoma; other causes of obstructive jaundice, such as biliary tract stones, should be investigated.

#### **DIAGNOSIS**

Stool examination for *Opisthorchis* or *Clonorchis* ova is the standard. Other specimens that can be used for ova detection are duodenal fluid or bile collected via endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography (ERCP) or during surgery.

Serology can diagnose acute infection but is not helpful in chronic infection or re-infection in endemic areas, as a positive antibody will persist after treatment. Detection of coproantigen can be used as a "test of cure" after treatment.

Where available polymerase chain reaction (PCR) can identify *Opisthorchis* DNA in fecal samples and distinguish it from intestinal flukes with high sensitivity and specificity. It is also useful for epidemiologic surveys.[8](#page--1-7)

Ultrasonography (US) of the liver and gallbladder in early infection usually shows an enlarged, non-functioning gallbladder with sludge and periductal fibrosis[.9](#page--1-8) Later-stage infections can show dilatation of intrahepatic bile ducts or a mass. A liver mass with intralesional bile duct dilatation is suggestive of cholangiocarcinoma. Cholangiography was performed before the availability of computed tomography (CT) or magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). Dilated intrahepatic bile ducts with distal clubbing can be visualized ([Fig. 128.1.4](#page--1-9)), as well as occasional filling defects due to the presence of adult flukes. CT or MRI is useful for staging of cholangiocarcinoma.

#### **TREATMENT**

#### *Opisthorchis viverrini*

Praziquantel is the drug of choice. At a dose of 25 mg/kg body weight orally three times over 1 to 2 days, the cure rate was 100%[.10](#page--1-10) A single dose of 40 mg/kg at bedtime gave a 91% to 95% cure, whereas a dose of 50 mg/kg gave a 97% cure but with a higher rate of adverse events.[11,12](#page--1-11) Therefore praziquantel 40 mg/ kg, is recommended for mass treatment.
