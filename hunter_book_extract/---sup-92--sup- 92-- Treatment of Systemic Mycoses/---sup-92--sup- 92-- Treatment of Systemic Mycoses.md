# **<sup>92</sup> 92** Treatment of Systemic Mycoses

*Edward C. Oldfield III*

## KEY FEATURES

- • The older, inexpensive, but more toxic formulation of amphotericin B deoxycholate (AMBD) is being replaced with more expensive, but less toxic, lipid formulations.
- • The triazoles are well tolerated for chronic therapy but have multiple drug interactions due to the inhibition of cytochrome P450 hepatic enzymes.
- • Voriconazole represents an advance in the treatment of invasive *Aspergillus* infections and has become the drug of choice.
- • Posaconazole is the first orally available antifungal with significant activity against the agents of mucormycosis, chromoblastomycosis, phaeohyphomycosis, mycetoma, and *Scedosporium apiospermum.*
- • Isavuconazole is a broad-spectrum antifungal with fewer drug interactions than voriconazole and posaconazole and is much better tolerated than voriconazole.
- • Echinocandins are the drugs of choice for empiric treatment of *Candida* bloodstream infections, pending speciation, because of their broad spectrum of activity and minimal toxicity.

## **INTRODUCTION**

Treatment of systemic mycoses is a clinical challenge. Infections are chronic, with a tendency to relapse, and the standard therapy, amphotericin B, has multiple toxicities. Introduction of azole antifungals provides relatively non-toxic long-term therapy. This chapter discusses the properties and use of the major antifungals: amphotericin B, flucytosine, triazoles, and echinocandins. Availability and cost of antifungals vary extensively from country to country; amphotericin B deoxycholate is unavailable in 42 of 155 countries surveyed, with daily prices ranging from <\$1 to \$171[.1](#page-5-0) Flucytosine has even less availability and is not unavailable in 76% of surveyed countries, at a daily price varying from \$4.60 to \$1409. Fluconazole and itraconazole have the best global availability. Specific treatment indications, duration of therapy, and parameters indicating response are covered in the disease chapters.

## **AMPHOTERICIN B**

Amphotericin B is a product of *Streptomyces nodosus.* Despite its toxicities, amphotericin remains the standard therapeutic agent for many of the deep mycoses.

## **Mechanism of Action**

The polyene structure of amphotericin B is responsible for both its therapeutic and its toxic properties. Amphotericin B interacts with cell membrane sterols, altering the integrity of the membrane with leakage of intracellular contents. In fungi, interaction with ergosterol inhibits fungal growth, whereas in human cells, the interaction with cholesterol results in toxic side effects. Amphotericin B has a post-antifungal effect with prolonged inhibition of fungal growth after drug exposure.

## **Sensitive Organisms**

Most systemic fungi are sensitive to amphotericin B: *Coccidioides immitis, Cryptococcus neoformans, Histoplasma capsulatum, Blastomyces dermatitidis, Paracoccidioides brasiliensis, Candida,* and *Aspergillus* spp. There is also activity against some protozoa: *Entamoeba, Naegleria, Leishmania,* and trypanosomes. Isolates of *Pseudallescheria boydii, Candida lusitaniae, Trichosporon beigelii, Aspergillus tereus,* and *Scedosporium inflatum* are usually resistant. There is no testing standardization among laboratories, and in vitro results do not always correlate with clinical results; therefore there is little value in routine susceptibility testing or serum levels of amphotericin B. Development of resistance during therapy has not been a problem.

Synergy between amphotericin B and flucytosine makes this combination the treatment of choice for cryptococcal meningitis.

## **Pharmacologic Properties**

Peak serum concentrations of amphotericin B with standard doses are 0.5 to 2.0 µg/mL. The fate of the drug is unknown, and no metabolites have been identified. There is biphasic excretion, with a rapid elimination half-life of 24 hours, followed by a prolonged terminal half-life of 15 days. Renal excretion accounts for only 3% to 5% of total drug elimination. Thus amphotericin does not accumulate in renal failure, and no dosage adjustment is necessary, even in anephric patients. Amphotericin B is not removed by peritoneal dialysis or hemodialysis. Biliary excretion is 19%, but hepatic disease does not necessitate a dosage change.

The standard formulation of amphotericin B is with deoxycholate (AMBD, Fungizone, Squibb). A daily dose of 0.5 to 1.0 mg/kg is reconstituted with 10 mL of sterile water and added to 5% dextrose. Even minimal amounts of sodium or chloride will reduce bioactivity and induce turbidity in the infusion; therefore AMBD should not be mixed with electrolytes or acidic solutions. AMBD is lightsensitive, but during a 24-hour period there is no appreciable loss of activity and no need to wrap the bottle with aluminum foil. The drug is poorly absorbed from the gastrointestinal tract and should never be given orally to treat systemic infections. Its only oral use is for candidal infections of the oropharynx resistant to triazoles.

Lipid formulations reduce the nephrotoxicity of AMBD: amphotericin B lipid complex (ABLC, Abelcet, Enzon), amphotericin B cholesteryl sulfate complex (ABCS, Amphotec), and liposomal amphotericin B (Ambisome, Astellas).[2](#page-5-1) ABLC has similar infusion-related toxicity to AMBD, and Amphotec has increased and Ambisome less infusion-related toxicity. Lipid formulations have increased concentration in the spleen, liver, and lung, resulting in less AMB in the kidneys. Because their costs are 10-fold to 20-fold greater than AMBD, lipid products are often reserved for patients with renal insufficiency or who are refractory to or intolerant of conventional AMBD. The dose of ABLC is 5.0 mg/kg/day given as a single infusion at 2.5 mg/kg/hour. For Ambisome, the dose is 3 mg/kg/day for empiric therapy, 3 to 5 mg/kg/day for systemic fungal infections, and 6 mg/kg/day for cryptococcal meningitis. For Amphotec, the dose is 3 to 4 mg/kg/day. Additional AMB products are available internationally: Fungisome (1–3 mg/kg/day), AmBil (3–6 mg/kg/day), and Lambin (0.25–1.5 mg/kg/day for plain,

3–6 mg/kg/day lipid). Dosing is based solely on pharmacologic characteristics, not efficacy studies.

## **Therapeutic Use**

AMBD is initiated with a 1-mg test dose in 5% dextrose infused over 20 minutes to evaluate for a common febrile response. Subsequent dosage increments are determined by the severity of the reactions encountered and the severity of the fungal infection. For chronic infections, the dose can be increased daily until the desired dose is reached. In severe cases, the full therapeutic dose (usually 35–50 mg) can be put in 500 mL of 5% dextrose. The equivalent of 1 mg is infused over 20 to 30 minutes, and if no severe reactions occur, the remainder is infused over 2 to 3 hours.[3](#page-5-2)

Duration of therapy depends on the clinical situation. With availability of less toxic oral triazoles, amphotericin is often used as a 14-day induction, followed by an oral triazole.

## **Toxicity**

Infusion-related toxicities are fever (occasionally >40°C), rigors, headaches, anorexia, nausea, vomiting, dyspnea, and hypotension. Intravenous meperidine hydrochloride (0.5 mg/kg) can terminate rigors and chills.[4](#page-5-3) For patients with severe rigors, meperidine can be given prophylactically. Hydrocortisone (25 mg) added to the infusion bottle can decrease the frequency, but not severity, of fever and chills. Pre-medication with acetaminophen and diphenhydramine can also help. Non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs should not be used, as they can enhance nephrotoxicity. Many patients will develop tolerance to amphotericin B, and hydrocortisone can be discontinued.

A triad of infusion-related side effects (chest pain, dyspnea, and hypoxia or severe abdomen/flank/leg pain or flushing and urticaria), usually occurring in the first 5 minutes of infusion with rapid response to intravenous diphenhydramine, has been reported with liposomal products[.5](#page-5-4) The mean frequency has been about 20% and is not lessened by decreasing the concentration or lengthening the infusion, and is only partially reduced with prophylactic diphenhydramine. The liposome itself appears to be the causative agent.

More than 80% of patients can develop alteration of renal function with AMBD, with the serum creatinine level rising to 2.0 to 3.0 mg/dL, where it may plateau and therapy can continue. Renal toxicity is enhanced by volume depletion, so 500 to 1000 mL of normal saline before each dose can be given. Lipid formulations should be considered in patients with progressive renal dysfunction. If a lipid product is not available, once the creatinine rises above 3.0 mg/dL, the AMBD can be temporarily withheld. A double dose on alternate days (usually not exceeding 70 mg) is as efficacious as daily therapy.

In patients who receive a total dose of AMBD less than 4 g, renal insufficiency is usually reversible; once the total dose exceeds 5 g, a degree of renal insufficiency will persist.

Seventy-five percent of patients will have a decrease in hematocrit of 10 units; one-third will have a reduction of ≥15 units. Hematocrit decreases early in therapy and then stabilizes. Thrombocytopenia and neutropenia are rare. Renal potassium wasting is common, and oral supplementation is necessary in 25% of patients; saline infusions to decrease nephrotoxicity increase potassium loss. Hypomagnesemia has been noted. During prolonged therapy, twice-weekly serum creatinine, blood urea nitrogen, potassium, magnesium, and hematocrit should be measured.

## Pregnancy

Amphotericin B has been used in pregnancy without evidence of teratogenesis or toxicity in infants.

## **FLUCYTOSINE**

Flucytosine (5-fluorocytosine) is a fluorinated pyrimidine synthesized as an anti-tumor agent in 1957. The drug has a narrow spectrum of activity and is used because of its synergy with amphotericin B against cryptococcus.

## **Mechanism of Action**

Flucytosine is deaminated by cytosine deaminase within the fungal cell to 5-fluorouracil (5-FU) and incorporated into fungal RNA, leading to faulty protein synthesis and growth inhibition. During treatment with flucytosine, 5-FU can reach levels similar to those during chemotherapy, with significant toxicity.

## **Sensitive Organisms**

Flucytosine is active against *Cryptococcus neoformans, Candida albicans,* other *Candida* species, and agents of chromomycosis. When flucytosine is used alone, resistance develops during therapy in as many as two-thirds of isolates.

## **Pharmacokinetics**

Oral absorption and penetration of tissue by flucytosine are excellent; tissue levels are equal to or greater than those in serum. The concentration of flucytosine in cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) averages 75% of serum levels. Excretion is primarily renal, with minimal metabolism. The half-life of flucytosine with normal renal function is 3 to 4 hours; minor decreases in renal function lead to prolongation. Both peritoneal dialysis and hemodialysis remove the drug.

## **Dosage and Administration**

The standard dose of flucytosine (Ancobon,Valeant North America) is 100 mg/kg/day divided into four doses. It must be adjusted in renal insufficiency to avoid toxic levels (>100 µg/mL): for creatinine clearance (CrCl) of 20 to 40 mL/min, give a normal dose of 25 mg/ kg/dose, but prolong the interval to 12 hours; for CrCl of 10 to 20 mL/min, increase the interval to 24 hours. With hemodialysis, give a dose of 25 mg/kg after each dialysis. Serum drug levels (maintaining a peak of >25 µg/mL and <100 µg/mL), creatinine, liver function, and platelet and white blood cell counts must be monitored. The 5-FU peak level should be obtained 2 hours post dose after 3–5 days of therapy; however, levels will usually not be available in low-income settings.

## **Toxicity**

Gastrointestinal (18%), hepatic (7%), and hematologic (18%) adverse events are most frequent. Although gastrointestinal events are usually not severe, severe colitis has been reported. Transient hepatitis that resolves with discontinuation of the drug can occur.

Neutropenia is the most common hematologic adverse event; thrombocytopenia can also occur. Bone marrow toxicity usually resolves with decreased dosage or discontinuation of flucytosine; however, fatal bone marrow suppression has been reported. Maculopapular rashes and eosinophilia are less common. Flucytosine should be used with caution in women of childbearing age because of possible teratogenicity.

## **Therapeutic Indications**

The combination of amphotericin B and flucytosine as induction therapy during the first 14 days is the treatment of choice for cryptococcal meningitis and disseminated disease. The presence of amphotericin B decreases the emergence of flucytosine resistance but can lead to an increase in flucytosine toxicity.

#### **TRIAZOLES**

Azoles have advanced the treatment of systemic mycoses, including first-generation drugs: fluconazole, itraconazole, and ketoconazole, and second-generation drugs: voriconazole, posaconazole, and isavuconazole. They are active against dimorphic fungi, yeasts, and dermatophytes. Azoles are fungistatic. In comparison with amphotericin B, they are efficacious, less toxic, and more convenient. Azoles are commonly used for sub-acute clinical presentations, chronic suppression, and meningitis (especially fluconazole), with amphotericin B often reserved for the initial management of fulminant infections.

#### **Mechanism of Action**

Triazoles are potent inhibitors of ergosterol synthesis. They block the cytochrome P450-dependent enzyme C-14 alpha-demethylase, needed to convert lanosterol to ergosterol. Their inhibition of cytochrome P450, especially CYP3A4, leads to drug interactions and toxic effects when used with drugs that are dependent on cytochrome P450 enzymes for metabolism<sup>6</sup> (Table 92.1). Itraconazole and posaconazole are more potent inhibitors of CYP3A4 than fluconazole and voriconazole. Fluconazole and voriconazole are strong inhibitors of CYP2C19 and CYP2C9. Isavuconazole is a substrate of P-glycoprotein and an inhibitor of CYP3A4. If other drugs induce CYP450 enzymes, it can lead to sub-therapeutic azole levels and clinical failure. Triazoles (except isavuconazole) increase the QT interval and have rarely been associated with torsade de pointes. Caution is recommended when administering with another drug that prolongs the QT interval, especially if they are metabolized by CYP3A4. They are teratogenic and embryotoxic in animals and are not recommended during pregnancy or while nursing.

Resistance is increasing. Decreased susceptibility in cryptococcal isolates has been reported from Africa, especially in relapsed infection. Azole resistance in *Aspergillus fumigatus* has been seen in western Europe. Resistance can occur in patients on long-term therapy and in those with no prior exposure, and has been associated with high mortality. Combination therapy with an echinocandin and an azole, like posaconazole, may be useful in resistance. Antifungal susceptibility testing can be helpful but is rarely available.

#### **Itraconazole**

Itraconazole is the preferred agent for *Histoplasma capsulatum*, *Blastomyces dermatitidis*, *Sporothrix schenckii*, and *Paracoccidioides brasiliensis*. It is supplied as 100-mg capsules, as an oral solution, and as an intravenous formulation (Sporanox, Janssen). It is similar to ketoconazole: highly lipophilic, protein bound, achieves low CSF levels, and undergoes extensive hepatic metabolism. Gastric acidity is required for optimal oral absorption of capsules, but not the oral solution; absorption of capsules is increased twofold to threefold when taken with food. Capsule absorption may be 50% lower in patients with AIDS. (See Table 92.1 for drug interactions.)

Itraconazole should be initiated with a loading dose of 200 mg three times daily for 3 days to rapidly achieve a steady state. No adjustment is required with renal insufficiency; caution should be used in hepatic impairment. Target trough serum levels are >0.5 ug/ml for prophylaxis and 1.0–2.0 ug/ml for treatment measured 4–7 days after starting itraconazole by high pressure liquid chromatography.<sup>11</sup>

The most common side effects of itraconazole and ketoconazole are nausea, vomiting, and abdominal pain that can be decreased by administering it with a meal. Hepatitis that can be severe, but rarely fatal, can occur with all three first-generation triazoles. Asymptomatic elevation of transaminases occurs in <3%.

Itraconazole has negative inotropic effects; congestive heart failure and peripheral edema have been reported. It should not be used in patients with ventricular dysfunction. A syndrome of severe hypokalemia, hypertension, adrenal insufficiency, and rhabdomyolysis has been reported with doses of 600 mg/day.

#### **Fluconazole**

Fluconazole is the preferred agent for *Coccidioides immitis, Cryptococcus neoformans*, and oropharyngeal and esophageal *Candida*. <sup>12</sup> The drug is available as oral and intravenous preparations. It is water soluble, has low protein binding, achieves high levels in the urine, and has high CSF penetration (70%–90% of peak serum concentration), making it an excellent choice for treatment of urinary tract infections and meningitis. A single loading dose of double the maintenance dose is given on the first day to achieve a steady state. As oral bioavailability is better than 90%, oral and intravenous dosing are the same. There is minimal hepatic metabolism, with 80% of the drug excreted unchanged in the urine. The dose of fluconazole should be decreased by 50% and 75% when the CrCl is <50 and <20 mL/min, respectively. For patients on hemodialysis, a full dose is given after each dialysis (see Table 92.1 for drug interactions).

#### Voriconazole

Voriconazole (Vfend, Pfizer) is an advance in the treatment of invasive Aspergillus, Fusarium, and Scedosporium apiospermum.<sup>13</sup> It is related to fluconazole and available intravenously, in tablets (50 and 200 mg), and in an oral suspension (40 mg/mL). Oral formulations have a 96% bioavailability. It is extensively metabolized by cytochrome P450 enzymes, especially CYP2C19 and to a lesser extent by CYPC2C9 and CYP3A4 (see Table 92.1 for drug interactions). Inter-patient variability in serum levels is due to genetic polymorphisms. Low levels are associated with clinical failure, and increased levels are associated with neurologic toxicity. Among Asians, 15% to 20% are homozygous-poor metabolizers, resulting in increased serum levels. Monitoring of trough drug levels is recommended after 1 week of therapy, with a target of >1 to 5.5 mg/L. 14 CSF levels are 50% of plasma levels. The most frequent adverse event has been visual disturbances, occurring in 20% to 30% of patients. These usually start within 30 minutes of the dose, last about 30 minutes, and are described as increased brightness, blurred vision, altered color perception, and photopsia. Nausea and vomiting (6%), diarrhea (3%), and headache (4%) can occur. Hallucinations, elevated transaminases (3%), and rare hepatic failure have been reported. Photosensitivity is common, and voriconazole is an independent risk factor for skin cancer in organ transplant patients, especially squamous cell carcinoma (SCC), which tends to be very aggressive. At 5 years post-lung transplant, 46% of those exposed to voriconazole developed SCC compared with 18% of those never exposed. 15 Elevation of fluoride levels and painful periostitis and exostoses have occurred in transplant patients on long-term voriconazole. QT prolongation and torsades de pointes have been reported. Mild to moderate rashes occur in 7%.

Intravenously, a loading dose of 6 mg/kg every 12 hours for 24 hours should be given, followed by a maintenance dose of 4 mg/kg every 12 hours. The oral dose is 200 mg every 12 hours (1 hour before or after eating) for those weighing >40 kg and 100 mg every 12 hours for those <40 kg. For patients with a CrCl <50 mL/min, the intravenous formulation should be avoided. With mild to moderate cirrhosis, patients can receive the normal loading dose, but the maintenance dose should be reduced by 50%.

phaeohyphomycosis, mycetoma, and *Scedosporium apiospermum.*[16](#page-6-3) The drug is available as an oral suspension, a delayed-release tablet, and an IV formulation (Noxafil, Schering). The oral suspension is given at 200 mg qid until clinical improvement and then 400 mg bid for treatment; 200 mg tid is given for prophylaxis. The suspension must be administered with a meal or nutritional supplement for absorption (bioavailability increases 2.5–4.0-fold). Diarrhea, mucositis, and poor food intake can occur with concomitant use of proton pump inhibitors. The delayed-release tablet (100 mg) is dosed at 300 mg twice a day on day 1 then 300 mg daily. The same levels are achieved with or without food, even though the package insert indicates with food. The IV formulation is dosed the same as tablets. Use with caution with CrCl <50 mL/min.

The majority of posaconazole is excreted unchanged in the feces. There is no dose adjustment for renal or hepatic insufficiency. Posaconazole is a substrate of P-glycoprotein and an inhibitor of CYP3A4.

Posaconazole is well tolerated, with elevated liver function tests (3%), nausea (8%), and vomiting (6%), similar to fluconazole.

## **Isavuconazole**

Isavuconazole (Cresemba, Astellas) is a broad-spectrum triazole administered as a water-soluble prodrug, isavuconazonium sulfate; it represents a significant advance in the spectrum of activity with less toxicity and fewer drug interactions. Isavuconazole has greater avidity for the binding pocket in the fungal CYP5 protein, conferring a broader spectrum of activity. It is active against all *Candida* species, *Aspergillus, Paecilomyces,* and *Scedosporium apiospermum,* with variable, but good, activity against *Mucor* spp. Isavuconazole is active against *Cryptococcus* and the dimorphic fungi *Histoplasma, Coccidioides, Blastomyces,* and *Paracoccidioides*, [17](#page-6-4) and against many dematiaceous fungi (*Bipolaris, Curvularia, Alternaria, Exophiala*) and dermatophytes. There is limited activity against *Fusarium* and *Scedosporium prolificans.* Isavuconazole is approved by the Food and Drug Administration in the United States for treatment of invasive aspergillosis and mucormycosis. In the Infectious Disease Society of America guidelines for management of aspergillosis, isavuconazole is listed as an alternative for patients who cannot tolerate voriconazole, along with liposomal AMB. It is non-inferior to voriconazole in invasive aspergillosis with fewer side effect[s18](#page-6-5) and is comparable to AMB for patients with mucormycosis.[19](#page-6-6)

Isavuconazole is available in an oral (98% bioavailability) and IV formulation (with use of inline filter) and can be given with renal impairment. A loading dose of 200 mg q8h is given for 2 days followed by 200 mg daily for both the oral and IV formulations. There is no effect of food; it has a terminal half-life of 100 to 130 hours. The drug has no renal excretion and is a moderate inhibitor of CYP3A4 (see [Table 92.1](#page-3-0) for drug interactions). Unlike the other azoles that prolong the QT interval, isavuconazole shortens it.

Isavuconazole is relatively well tolerated, with the most common adverse events being nausea, vomiting, and diarrhea. Less commonly headache, rash, and peripheral edema occur. Liver function abnormalities have been noted, but severe hepatotoxicity is rare.

## **ECHINOCANDINS**

Echinocandins inhibit fungal cell wall glucan by inhibiting beta-1,3 glucan synthesis. They are fungicidal against *Candida* spp. but fungistatic against *Aspergillus.* The three available echinocandins caspofungin, micafungin, and anidulafungin—are therapeutically equivalent. The drugs are available only intravenously; choices between them are based upon cost or drug interactions. The major use of echinocandins is in the treatment of systemic candidal infections, especially the empiric treatment of candida bloodstream infection before species identification. Resistance has occurred in *Candida glabrata* isolates.[7](#page-5-6) They are also used for empiric therapy in febrile neutropenia. The echinocandins are highly active against *Aspergillus* spp.

## **Caspofungin**

Caspofungin (Cancidas, Merck) is highly protein bound and slowly cleared from plasma by distribution into tissues[.20](#page-6-7) Metabolism is by slow peptide hydrolysis. There is no interaction with the P450 system. Tacrolimus levels are decreased by 25%. The usual loading dose is 70 mg followed by 50 mg daily. No adjustment is needed with renal insufficiency or dialysis. With moderate hepatic insufficiency, the maintenance dose is decreased to 35 mg daily. Efavirenz, nevirapine, dexamethasone, rifampin, phenytoin, and carbamazepine all reduce serum levels by about 20%. When these drugs are used, a daily dose of 70 mg should be maintained. Caspofungin is well tolerated; reported adverse events include fever, headache, nausea, vomiting, phlebitis, and abnormal liver function tests. Histamine-related symptoms have been noted (rash, pruritus, facial flushing).

## **Micafungin**

Micafungin (Mycamine, Astellas) is metabolized in the liver and excreted in an inactive form in the bile and urine[.21](#page-6-8) The drug is not metabolized by the P450 system. Sirolimus and nifedipine levels are increased by 20%. Micafungin is well tolerated, with a side effect profile like that of caspofungin. The recommended dose is 50 mg/day for prophylaxis and 100 mg/day when used for treatment. There is no dose adjustment for renal insufficiency or mild to moderate liver disease.

## **Anidulafungin**

Anidulafungin (Eraxis, Pfizer) is biotransformed and excreted in the feces[.22](#page-6-9) It is not metabolized, so there are few drug interactions, and there is no dose adjustment with renal or hepatic insufficiency. Anidulafungin is well tolerated, with only rare adverse events. The recommended dose for esophageal candidiasis is a 100-mg loading dose followed by 50 mg daily. For invasive candidiasis, the loading dose is 200 mg followed by 100 mg daily.
