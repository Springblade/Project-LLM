# **34.1** Rotavirus

*Miren Iturriza-Gómara, Nigel A. Cunliffe*

## KEY FEATURES

- • Group A rotaviruses are the single most important cause of acute gastroenteritis in infants and young children worldwide.
- • Protective immunity against rotavirus infection is mediated by rotavirus-specific secretory IgA antibodies on the intestinal mucosal surface.
- • The diagnosis of rotavirus gastroenteritis is usually made by the detection of viral antigen in stool using a variety of immunologic methods, or by the detection of viral RNA in stool using reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction.
- • A distinct winter seasonality of rotavirus infection is evident in temperate countries, whereas year-round infection is common in tropical countries.
- • Six combinations of G and P types (G1P[8], G2P[4], G3P[8], G4P[8], G9P[8], and G12P[8]) together comprise more than 90% of global rotavirus strains; however, in some developing countries other types may predominate (e.g., G10, G8 or P[6]).
- • Rehydration and restoration of electrolyte balance are the primary aims of treatment of acute rotavirus gastroenteritis.
- • Live attenuated oral rotavirus vaccines are licensed globally and have been incorporated into childhood immunization schedules in 87 countries with a substantial reduction of rotavirus hospitalizations and deaths.

# **INTRODUCTION**

<span id="page-0-0"></span>Rotavirus is recognized as the single most important agent of diarrhea in infants. Before the rollout of vaccination, rotavirus caused 37% (≈450,000) of diarrheal deaths and 5% of all deaths among children younger than 5 years of age[.1](#page-2-0) Although a child will experience at least one rotavirus infection by 3 to 5 years of age in all settings, the consequence of infection is strikingly different between high- and low-income countries: five countries account for more than half of all deaths attributable to rotavirus infection, and India alone accounts for 22% of all deaths.[1](#page-2-0)

The recognition of this huge burden of rotavirus disease led to the development of rotavirus vaccines soon after its discovery in 1973 on thin-section electron microscopy of duodenal biopsies from a child with acute gastroenteritis (AGE).[2](#page-2-1) The name *rotavirus* was coined due to its characteristic wheel-shaped (*rota* is Latin for wheel) morphology on electron microscopy [\(Fig. 34.1.1](#page-0-0)). The virus is a double-stranded RNA virus: genus *Rotavirus,* family Reoviridae[.3](#page-2-2)

The introduction of rotavirus vaccination programs has resulted in a significant reduction in the global burden of diarrhea; it has been estimated that among children younger than 5 years of age, vaccination has resulted in a 67% and 38% reduction in rotavirus diarrhea and all-cause AGE hospitalizations, respectively[.4](#page-2-3) Notably, rotavirus vaccine introduction has led to a halving of rotavirusattributable deaths in less than a decade[.5](#page-3-0)

## **EPIDEMIOLOGY**

Rotavirus infections occur worldwide. Most symptomatic infections occur in children between 3 months and 2 years of age. In temperate countries, rotavirus infections show winter seasonality, whereas infections occur year-round in most tropical countries[.6](#page-3-1)

Rotavirus spreads via the fecal–oral route, primarily through person-to-person transmission. Only a few virus particles are required to infect the susceptible host.

Species A rotaviruses are classified into G and P genotypes based on the sequence diversity of the RNA segments encoding the outer capsid proteins VP7 and VP4, respectively.[7](#page-3-2) To date, 32 G genotypes and 47 P genotypes have been described among species A rotaviruses, and these can be found in different combinations.[3](#page-2-2) Globally, G1P[8], G2P[4], G3P[8], G4P[8], G9P[8], and G12 in combination with P[6] or P[8] typically account for >90% of the genotypes that infect humans, although geographic and temporal differences in the distribution of genotypes are well documented[.8–11](#page-3-3) Immunization with the currently licensed vaccines provides cross-protection against commonly circulating strains, and there is no evidence that vaccination has resulted in the emergence of vaccine-escape strains. However, evidence suggests that vaccine efficacy is higher against vaccine-containing (homotypic) strains, and in the context of a highly reduced incidence of rotavirus diarrhea, strain distribution post-vaccine introduction may shift.[12–17](#page-3-4)

# **NATURAL HISTORY, PATHOGENESIS, AND PATHOLOGY**

Rotavirus infection occurs throughout life, and successive rotavirus infections commonly occur during infancy and early childhood. The first rotavirus infection typically results in the most severe disease outcome, although infection in the neonatal period often tends to be asymptomatic[.18](#page-3-5) Subsequent rotavirus infections, irrespective of strain type, are associated with milder disease or may even be asymptomatic, although differences in the age of first infection and number of infections required to acquire protection from symptomatic disease vary according to population. Typically, infants in low-income countries experience earlier infection and a larger number of symptomatic episodes[.19–21](#page-3-6) Although severe disease is less common, rotavirus infection may nevertheless cause gastroenteritis in older children and adults, and the elderly appear to become more susceptible as their immunity wanes[.22–25](#page-3-7) Since the introduction of rotavirus vaccines, there is evidence that rotavirus disease may be shifting to older ages[.26,27](#page-3-8)

Rotaviruses infect the duodenal mucosa and replicate in the mature enterocytes. The infection causes shortening and atrophy of the intestinal villi and enterocyte vacuolization and death that leads to impairment of the absorption of water and electrolytes from the lumen, contributing to osmotic diarrhea, which is followed by dehydration[.28](#page-3-9) Additional mechanisms have also been proposed, such as expression of the rotavirus non-structural protein NSP4, which acts as an enterotoxin, and secretion mediated by the enteric nervous system[29,30](#page-3-10); in addition, secretion of serotonin can activate signaling pathways that induce diarrhea and vomiting.[31,32](#page-3-11)

Susceptibility to rotavirus infection is determined by nonimmunologic factors such as the differential expression of genetically determined rotavirus receptors, histo-blood group antigens[,33–35](#page-3-12) and immunologic factors. Antibodies and T cells play a critical role in protection against recurrent infection and virus clearance. This is clearly demonstrated by the failure to resolve rotavirus infection, including infection with live-attenuated vaccine strains, in children with severe combined immunodeficiency[.36–38](#page-3-13) Serum rotavirus-specific immunoglobulin A (IgA) antibody levels are currently the best marker of protection against rotavirus disease, and the presence of anti-rotavirus IgA antibodies in serum is widely used as a marker of vaccine take, although the validity of this measure across populations remains to be demonstrated[.39–41](#page-3-14)

## **CLINICAL FEATURES**

The onset of symptoms is abrupt after a short incubation period of 1 to 2 days. Fever, vomiting, and non-bloody watery diarrhea are seen in the majority of infected children and last for 2 to 6 days. The major complication is dehydration that appears shortly after the onset of disease and varies in severity. The cause of death after rotavirus infection is dehydration, leading to metabolic disturbances and shock.

Rotavirus can enter the bloodstream, and both antigenemia and viremia have been described.[42–45](#page-3-15) Despite the detection of rotavirus RNA in cerebrospinal fluid of infected children presenting with neurologic symptoms[46,47](#page-3-16) and the association of neurologic symptoms with rotavirus diarrhea,[48–50](#page-3-17) direct evidence or specific pathologic findings of extra-intestinal disease caused by rotavirus are lacking.

# **PATIENT EVALUATION, DIAGNOSIS, AND DIFFERENTIAL DIAGNOSIS**

The patient with AGE should first be evaluated for the presence and the degree of dehydration before seeking the etiology of the disease. It is not possible to distinguish rotavirus gastroenteritis from other viral or bacterial causes of non-inflammatory diarrhea solely on clinical grounds. To establish an etiologic diagnosis, stool specimens from the patient in the acute phase of the disease can be examined by a variety of methods for the presence of rotavirus. Antigen detection is currently the most widely used method; immuno-chromatographic assays have been developed that can be used at the point of care. However, enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) offers a low-cost, sensitive, and specific approach for the diagnosis of acute rotavirus diarrhea, and is the most commonly used method for rotavirus detection in routine clinical practice.

Molecular methods that rely on the detection of rotavirus RNA in stool samples are also widely available, often as part of a multipathogen syndromic diagnostic approach[.51,52](#page-3-18) Reverse transcription– polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) offers both high sensitivity and specificity; however, RT-PCR can detect the presence of rotavirus in asymptomatically infected individuals, as rotavirus can be shed for prolonged periods after acute infection. Because rotavirus load in stool correlates with disease severity, the use of a viral load cut-off is advisable when applying quantitative or semi-quantitative RT-PCR for rotavirus diagnosis.[53,54](#page-3-19)

## **TREATMENT AND PREVENTION**

The mainstay of therapy for dehydration associated with rotavirus gastroenteritis consists of oral rehydration with fluids of specified electrolyte and glucose composition[.55](#page--1-0) Intravenous rehydration therapy is indicated for the patient with severe dehydration, shock, or reduced level of consciousness.

Dietary management is important in the care of children with acute diarrhea, and breastfeeding as well as the maintenance of adequate protein–calorie intake using age-appropriate foods should be encouraged[.56](#page--1-1) Zinc supplementation can improve the outcome of acute diarrhea in populations in which malnutrition is common, and the World Health Organization (WHO) recommends daily zinc supplementation for infants starting as soon as the diarrhea episode

#### has been recognized and lasting 10 to 14 days ([http://apps.who.int/](http://apps.who.int/iris/bitstream/10665/68627/1/WHO_FCH_CAH_04.7.pdf) [iris/bitstream/10665/68627/1/WHO\\_FCH\\_CAH\\_04.7.pdf](http://apps.who.int/iris/bitstream/10665/68627/1/WHO_FCH_CAH_04.7.pdf)).

Some studies have suggested modest benefits associated with the use of probiotics, reducing the duration of rotavirus diarrhea by 1 to 2 days.[57–62](#page--1-2) Use of anti-emetics (metoclopramide, dimenhydrinate, and ondansetron) for the treatment of rotavirus disease is not widely recommended despite a small number of studies suggesting a reduction in the number of vomiting episodes and a reduced need for intravenous rehydration and hospitalization.[62](#page--1-3) Other potential therapies for rotavirus gastroenteritis, including racecadotril, octreotide[,63](#page--1-4) or broad-spectrum antivirals such as nitazoxanide have reported mixed results and do not substantiate their use for the routine treatment of rotavirus diarrhea.[64–69](#page--1-5)

Personal hygiene measures, such as handwashing, safe disposal of feces, and disinfection of contaminated surfaces, are important in reducing the risk of transmission.

Two rotavirus vaccines are used worldwide: RotaTeq (Merck, USA), and Rotarix (GlaxoSmithKline, Belgium) [\(Table 34.1.1](#page-2-4)). Both vaccines are live attenuated and are highly (>90%) effective in preventing severe rotavirus disease in high-income countries[,70,71](#page--1-6) but efficacy is reduced in low-income countries to ≈50% to 60%.[72–74](#page--1-7) Although factors that determine this difference in efficacy are not fully understood, the impact of rotavirus vaccination is greater in low-income countries, saving more infant lives due to the higher rotavirus diarrhea burden in these countries.

Other live attenuated rotavirus vaccines are in use in some countries, and various others are in development, including a non-replicating parenteral vaccine. Current data suggest that live attenuated vaccines, regardless of strain composition, have similar efficacy and effectiveness and confer comparable levels of cross-protection against a variety of rotavirus genotypes ([Box 34.1.1\)](#page-2-5).

#### <span id="page-2-5"></span>**BOX 34.1.1** Treatment Considerations for Children With Acute Rotavirus Gastroenteritis

- • The mainstay of treatment for uncomplicated rotavirus gastroenteritis comprises oral rehydration solutions providing essential electrolyte replacement plus sugar and zinc.
- • For severe dehydration, shock and reduced level of consciousness, intravenous rehydration therapy is required.
- • Anti-motility agents are discouraged, particularly in infants and young children, as they are reported to be associated with rare but severe complications.
- • Live attenuated rotavirus vaccines administered at 6 weeks of age and then according to the Expanded Programme on Immunization schedule are the best approach to prevent severe rotavirus gastroenteritis and hospitalization.
