### **INTRODUCTION**

Paracoccidioidomycosis is a systemic mycosis endemic in South and Central America caused by dimorphic fungi of two species of genus: *Paracoccidioides brasiliensis* and *P. lutzii.*[1,2](#page-3-0)

This mycosis was discovered by Adolfo Lutz in Brazil in 1908. Alfonso Splendore (1912) published several cases in São Paulo, Brazil, and described the etiologic agent. Floriano P. de Almeida (1930) distinguished this mycosis from coccidioidomycosis[.1,3,4](#page-3-0) In 2006 a new species of *Paracoccidioides* was recognized and named *P. lutzii.* Three clades of *P. brasiliensis* have been detected, S1, PS2, and PS3, with different geographic distribution[.2,5,6](#page-3-1)

#### **EPIDEMIOLOGY**

Paracoccidioidomycosis is endemic in humid tropical and subtropical areas of Latin America, from Southern Mexico to 34° south in Argentina and Uruguay [\(Fig. 88.1\)](#page-1-0). It is common in Brazil, where 80% of all patients are detected and where it is one of the leading causes of death; it also occurs in Argentina, Colombia, Ecuador, Paraguay, and Venezuela[.3,7,8](#page-3-2) *P. lutzii* is only endemic in the west-central regions of Brazil (states of Goiás, Mato Grosso, and Rondônia).[5,6](#page-3-3) The incidence and prevalence of paracoccidioidomycosis are not known because there is no compulsory reporting except in some Brazilian states[.2](#page-3-1)

Endemic zones have acidic soils, rich in organic material, with many streams and rivers, and exuberant vegetation. Although the habitat of *Paracoccidioides* spp. is not well known, it probably lives in soil near water. It has been isolated from different natural sources, but these isolations are difficult to replicate. In addition to humans, infection has been observed in armadillos, squirrel monkeys, dogs, horses, cattle, and wild rodents. Animal-to-human and human-to-human transmission has not been confirmed.[2–4,7](#page-3-1)

Reactivation of latent pulmonary or extrapulmonary foci leading to progressive clinical forms is frequently observed in adult males older than 35 years of age, the majority of whom are rural workers. Genetics, smoking, and alcoholism seem to be risk factors.

The juvenile type of paracoccidioidomycosis is less common (only 3%–5% of clinical cases), affects both sexes equally, and has an acute or subacute course[.3,7,9](#page-3-2)

## **NATURAL HISTORY, PATHOGENESIS, AND PATHOLOGY**

In infected tissue and culture at 37°C, *Paracoccidioides* spp. appear as spherical cells of 10 to 40 µm in diameter with a thick birefringent cell wall and several peripheral buds, like a pilot wheel. Mother cells with a single blastoconidium and short chains of three to four budding cells are often found [\(Fig. 88.2](#page-1-1)). In Sabouraud dextrose agar and in yeast extract agar at 25°C, *Paracoccidioides* spp. grow very slowly and yield cotton-like, whitish colonies that exhibit branched, septated, and hyaline hyphae with chlamydospores and aleurioconidiae. Minor differences in the conidia's shape can be detected between the mycelial forms of the two *Paracoccidioides* species; the three *P. brasiliensis* clades are morphologically identical.[5](#page-3-3)

Infection is most likely acquired by airborne inhalation of aleurioconidiae that turn into yeast-like elements inside alveolar macrophages. A non-specific inflammatory reaction is initially observed. In a few days, the inflammatory changes progress to epithelioid cell granuloma with giant cells, plasmacytes, and lymphocytes[.10–13](#page-3-4) Microabscesses are common, and caseous necrosis is observed in lymph nodes and adrenal glands. Tissue repair involves fibrosis. Cell-mediated immunity, with a predominant Th1 cytokine response (INF-γ, IL12, IL2, TNF-α), is the most important defense mechanism, and is genetically controlled. Antibodies are produced during progressive disease, but their significance in the control of the infection is not well understood[.10,11](#page-3-4) In patients with severe disease there is an increased activity of regulatory T cells with a strong immune suppression produced by IL10 and TGF-β.

Progressive paracoccidioidomycosis may be the result of reactivation of a latent focus of infection (in chronic forms) or the lack of control of the primary infection (in the acute juvenile type)[.3,4,9,10](#page-3-2)

### **CLINICAL FEATURES**

#### **Non-Progressive Infections**

Primary infections are often asymptomatic or mild and selflimited; symptomatic primary infections are rare.[9](#page-3-6) Six percent to fifty percent of inhabitants of endemic regions have positive paracoccidioidin skin tests as evidence of a prior subclinical infection[.3,9](#page-3-2)

#### **Progressive Forms**

Acute Form of Juvenile Type

This clinical form in children and adolescents has an acute course marked by toxemia, fever, asthenia, anorexia, weight loss, subcutaneous abscesses, diffuse lymphadenopathy, hepatosplenomegaly, diarrhea, jaundice, anemia, and leukocytosis with eosinophilia. It is probably due to failure of the immune response during the primary infection.[10,11](#page-3-4) Acneiform lesions of the skin, scrofuloderma, osteomyelitis, and gastrointestinal involvement are often present. Moderate cases with a stable general condition and localized lymph node involvement occur ([Fig. 88.3](#page-1-2))[.1–4,7](#page-3-0) Involvement of the lungs and mucous membrane lesions are rarely observed.

# <span id="page-1-1"></span>Chronic Form of Adult Type

This usually occurs in adult males. It has an insidious onset with prominent asthenia, weight loss, and exertional dyspnea[.3,9,14](#page-3-2)

In 25% of cases, there is only pulmonary involvement, with low-grade fever, cough, mucopurulent sputum, hemoptysis, and dyspnea. Chest x-rays show bilateral symmetric lesions, generally perihilar in distribution, resembling the wings of the butterfly, formed by infiltrates, and micronodular and linear shadows [\(Fig.](#page-1-3) [88.4\)](#page-1-3). Death occurs after several years, due to cachexia or respiratory impairments[.3,7,14](#page-3-2)

<span id="page-1-3"></span>Multifocal presentation is observed in more than 70% of patients, with involvement of skin, mucous membranes, lungs, lymph nodes, adrenal glands, abdominal organs, and central nervous system (CNS). Typical oropharyngeal lesions are ulcers with hemorrhagic granulomatous foci and an infiltrated hard base

<span id="page-2-1"></span>(mulberry-like stomatitis) [\(Fig. 88.5\)](#page-2-0). A firm, red-violet edema is frequently observed in the lips and gingival mucosa (thromboid-like lip)[.3](#page-3-2) These lesions make eating and drinking painful. Laryngeal attacks cause dysphonia, obstructive dyspnea, and dysphagia.[2–4](#page-3-1)

Skin lesions include papules, nodules, and ulcers; they are often located on the face and neck ([Fig. 88.6](#page-2-1)). Some ulcers become vegetative and papillomatous. Cervical lymph nodes are generally hypertrophic and firm but can be suppurative or necrotic, opening to the skin and causing a scrofula-like lesion. Adrenal gland involvement occurs in more than 15% of chronic cases and, when severe, causes Addison's disease. CNS compromise is observed in 10% of cases; abscessed granulomas located in the posterior fossa and subacute meningoencephalitis have been reported [\(Fig. 88.7](#page-2-2)). Other locations are testicles, epididymis, prostate, bones, liver, and spleen. Death may occur from respiratory failure, malnutrition, or intercurrent infections.[3,4,9](#page-3-2)

In some Brazilian states (Mato Grosso, Goias) a different clinical form has been observed, characterized by chronic peritonitis, hepatosplenomegaly, mesenteric lymphadenopathy, and compromise of the digestive tract. This form is probably related to *P. lutzii*. After effective treatment, some lesions remain latent, and relapses can occasionally occur[.3](#page-3-2)

Most patients present with acute disseminated juvenile type or severe disseminated chronic form; the mortality rate is approximately 30% in treated cases[.2,3,9](#page-3-1)
- • Co-infection with tuberculosisis detected in 10% to 12% of cases.
- • The incidence of neoplasms, especially lung cancer, seems to be more common among the paracoccidioidomycosis patients[.2,4,9](#page-3-1)

# **PATIENT EVALUATION, DIAGNOSIS, AND DIFFERENTIAL DIAGNOSIS**

Diagnosis is confirmed by finding typical yeastlike elements of *Paracoccidioides* spp. in microscopy of wet preparations of specimens (see [Fig. 88.2\)](#page-1-1). Cultures should be done in yeast extract agar without glucose, brain–heart infusion agar, and Sabouraud dextrose agar with antibiotics and cycloheximide, and incubated for 4 weeks at 25°C and 37°C. The fungus grows slowly, and its isolation is difficult. Inoculation of clinical specimens in laboratory animals is rarely done.[1,3,4,7,9](#page-3-0)

Histopathologic specimens should be stained with periodic acid–Schiff or Grocott methenamine-silver.[3,9,14](#page-3-2)

In progressive forms of paracoccidioidomycosis, antibodies can be detected by immunodiffusion in agar gel, counterimmunoelectrophoresis, complement fixation tests, and enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA). A specific glycoprotein of 43 kDa (gp 43), as well as other antigens, have been used in testing[.9,11,14](#page-3-6) Antibodies against *Paracoccidioides* antigens can be detected by Western blot, but this is infrequently used[.15](#page-3-7) Antibody titers are proportional to severity of the infection, and with cure they decline or become negative. In endemic areas of *P. lutzii* serologic reactions should be done with species-specific antigens.[5,6,16](#page-3-3) In severe cases, antigen can be detected in serum and urine by ELISA using monoclonal antibodies against gp 43.[4,17](#page-3-8)

The paracoccidioidin skin test has little diagnostic value for progressive paracoccidioidomycosis. It can be used in epidemiologic studies; most infected people without active lesions have positive reactions.[3,4,9,10,14](#page-3-2)

In patients with severe disease, serology is positive with high titers; paracoccidioidin skin test is often negative; and polyclonal hypergammaglobulinemia and eosinophilia and low CD4-positive T-cell counts are frequently detected. All these alterations may revert to normal with clinical improvement.[3,4,9,14](#page-3-2)

The differential diagnosis of chronic disseminated disease can be confused with tuberculosis, histoplasmosis, leishmaniasis, carcinoma, and sarcoidosis. Acute disseminated disease presents with clinical characteristics similar to tuberculosis, malaria, leukemia, and lymphomas.

#### **TREATMENT**

Sulfonamides, ketoconazole, itraconazole, fluconazole, voriconazole, posaconazole, and amphotericin B have been successfully used for treatment.[18–20](#page-3-9) Accepted treatment schedules are ketoconazole 200 to 400 mg/day for 12 months; itraconazole 100 to 200 mg/ day for 6 months; and intravenous amphotericin B at daily dose of 0.7 to 0.8/kg, up to a maximum total dose of 35 mg/kg. Itraconazole is the treatment of choice and is effective in more than 95% of cases; however, neither itraconazole nor ketoconazole should be used in cases with CNS infection. The absorption of itraconazole requires gastric acid, and its effect can be reduced by fungal involvement of mesenteric lymph nodes and the digestive tract, especially in acute disseminated form. It should not be used for patients with tuberculosis being treated with rifampin[.19](#page-3-10) In severe cases where malabsorption is present, amphotericin B is indicated. Fluconazole by oral route or intravenously has been successfully used in cases with brain lesions, at a daily dose of 800 mg[.2,3](#page-3-1)

Co-trimoxazole is still frequently used in Brazil, especially in recently diagnosed patients with no previous therapy, in chronic unifocal progressive disease, and as maintenance after a course of amphotericin B. It is given to adults every 12 hours, at a dosage of 160 mg of trimethoprim and 800 mg of sulfamethoxazole, for 2 to 3 years.[4,18](#page-3-8) It is the treatment of choice in patients with CNS involvement, but in these cases higher doses are indicated: 320 to 1600 mg every 12 hours[.19](#page-3-10)

Children suffering paracoccidioidomycosis are usually treated with amphotericin B intravenously at daily dose of 0.7 mg/kg, or sulfadiazine 200 mg/kg/day orally. They may have difficulty taking oral medication and can have frequent involvement of mesenteric lymph nodes[.3,4,19](#page-3-2)

Other drugs that have been successfully used are voriconazole, posaconazole, and terbinafine, but clinical experience with them remains limited. Voriconazole has been used in double-blind comparative study with itraconazole, with similar efficacy; voriconazole is more expensive[.2,20](#page-3-1)

Paracoccidioidomycosis requires prolonged treatment. Relapses are common, and cure often leaves incapacitating sequelae, for example, laryngeal and tracheal stenosis, buccal atresia, and pulmonary fibrosis. According to studies in murine models of experimental paracoccidioidomycosis, the simultaneous administration of itraconazole and pentoxifylline reduced pulmonary fibrosis.[2,4,14](#page-3-1)

Although several antigens have been studied as immunogens to prevent paracoccidioidomycosis in laboratory animals, none of them have been used in human beings, and there is no measure to avoid the risk of infection.[2,4,10](#page-3-1)
