Albendazole at 400 mg twice daily for 3 to 7 days yielded only a 40% to 63% cure rate.[13](#page-0-0)

### *Clonorchis sinensis*

Praziquantel is effective for clonorchiasis. A dose of 25 mg/kg three times per day for 1 day yields an 85% cure rate, whereas the same dose given for 2 days cures up to 100%. A single dose of 40 mg/kg yielded only a 25% cure rate[.14](#page-0-1)

Patients with secondary cholangitis should be treated with antimicrobials. Cholangiocarcinoma, if detected early, can be resected. However, if detected late, palliative treatment by drainage of bile can help relieve symptoms of obstructive jaundice. The prognosis is poor for these patients, as chemotherapy or radiation therapy is usually not effective.

#### **PREVENTION AND CONTROL**

Thorough cooking of fish is the best way to prevent infection. This should be enforced through continuous health education in endemic areas. Control measures through mass treatment programs and improving sanitation can reduce the prevalence.

*Kittiyod Poovorawan, Yupaporn Wattanagoon*

#### **INTRODUCTION**

Fascioliasis is infection by the sheep liver flukes, *Fasciola* spp. The two species that infect humans are *F. hepatica* and *F. gigantica* [\(Fig.](#page-1-0) [128.2.1](#page-1-0)). Other herbivorous animals such as cattle, goats, water buffalo, horses, camels, hogs, rabbits, and deer can be infected with *Fasciola* spp.

### **EPIDEMIOLOGY**

Human fascioliasis has been reported worldwide. Endemic areas are South America, the Middle East, Asia, Africa, Europe, and the United States.

# **NATURAL HISTORY, PATHOGENESIS, AND PATHOLOGY**

Humans acquire *Fasciola* after ingestion of aquatic plants, such as fresh watercress, that are contaminated with *Fasciola* metacercaria. The metacercaria excyst in the duodenum and penetrate through the intestinal wall into the peritoneal cavity. They enter the liver through Glisson's capsule, moving through the liver parenchyma to their final habitat—the bile ducts—where they attain maturity and begin laying eggs. The immature parasites can wander, causing ectopic foci in organs such as the heart, lung, brain, and subcutaneous tissues.

The pathologic changes in human fascioliasis are related to the stages of infection. In the early stage of immature worm

Common bile duct obstruction rarely occurs. Once reaching the large bile duct, adult flukes cause hyperplasia, desquamation, and cystic dilatation of bile ducts. Ectopic fascioliasis, due to migration of worms to other organs, is not uncommon.

### **CLINICAL FEATURES**

Human fascioliasis is usually mild. Clinical symptoms can be described by the phases of infection.

# **Migratory Phase**

Symptoms occur when young flukes migrate through the liver capsule and parenchyma before reaching the bile ducts. They include dyspepsia, anorexia, nausea, vomiting, pain in the right hypochondrium, and hepatomegaly. Urticaria and eosinophilia are common.

#### **Biliary Tract Infection**

Once the flukes reside in the bile ducts, most patients have no clinical symptoms. On rare occasions, bile duct occlusion occurs with obstructive jaundice, cholangitis, or pancreatitis. In highly endemic areas, growth stunting in children occurs[.1,2](#page--1-0)

#### **Ectopic Fascioliasis**

Clinical symptoms and signs depend on the site of infection. Parasitic tracts, nodules, or abnormal masses can be found in subcutaneous tissues ([Fig. 128.2.2](#page-1-1)), the intestinal wall, lung, heart, or brain and can be accompanied by hemorrhage, for example, intracranial hemorrhage.

#### **Pharyngeal Form**

The pharyngeal form is caused by consumption of young flukes in infected livers of goats or sheep. The flukes attach to the mucosa of laryngopharyngeal tissue causing localized edema of the pharynx or larynx, leading to dysphagia and dyspnea. Patients can die of asphyxia if not recognized.

## **PATIENT EVALUATION, DIAGNOSIS, AND DIFFERENTIAL DIAGNOSIS**

The standard method is detection of *Fasciola* ova in feces. Ova should be differentiated from *Fasciolopsis buski* ova, a large intestinal

In these cases, patients should be put on a liver-free diet for 3 days before repeating stool examination to confirm the diagnosis.

Serologic diagnosis is useful in the acute phase, and ectopic fascioliasis as stool examination will be negative in these patients. Detection of antibody by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) using recombinant *F. hepatica* proteins has high sensitivity and specificity in chronic fascioliasis.[3](#page--1-1) Molecular diagnosis by PCR is sensitive for diagnosis and accurate for identification of *Fasciola* species.[4](#page--1-2)

Recovery of adult worms from surgical or autopsy specimens, or stool collection after treatment, can help to confirm the diagnosis.

US and CT of the liver are helpful, especially during the hepatic or migratory phase. Subcapsular hypodense areas and intrahepatic hypoechoic nodular lesions with poorly defined contours can be found on US. CT can show multiple hypodense nodules [\(Fig.](#page--1-3) [128.2.3\)](#page--1-3) and tunnel-like, branching hypodense tracts representing the migratory tracts of young flukes.[5](#page--1-4) During the biliary phase on US, adult fasciola can appear as a leaflike echogenic object without acoustic shadow in the gallbladder or common bile ducts[.6](#page--1-5) Filling defects due to the presence of adult fasciola in the bile duct can also be demonstrated during ERCP.

#### **TREATMENT**

With the failure of praziquantel in fascioliasis, triclabendazole, nitazoxanide, and artesunate have been tried. Praziquantel at 25 mg/ kg three times daily for 1 to 2 days was only partially effective. Triclabendazole 10 mg/kg in either a single dose or two doses in 1 day is effective, with cure rates of 79% and 92%, respectively. A randomized placebo-controlled trial of nitazoxanide 500 mg twice daily for 7 days gave a 60% cure rate. Children aged 4 to 11 years old were given a dose of 200 mg twice daily, and children aged 2 to 3 years old received 100 mg twice daily for 7 days; this resulted in a 40% cure rate[.7](#page--1-6) A randomized, controlled trial compared
