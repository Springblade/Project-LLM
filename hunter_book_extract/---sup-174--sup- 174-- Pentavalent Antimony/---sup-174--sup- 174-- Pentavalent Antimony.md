# **<sup>174</sup> 174** Pentavalent Antimony

*Edward T. Ryan, Alan J. Magill* [†](#page-0-0)

#### **DESCRIPTION**

Pentavalent antimony (SbV) is usually given as sodium stibogluconate (SSG) or meglumine antimoniate (MA).

# **AVAILABLE PRODUCTS**

- 1. SSG (Pentostam, GlaxoSmithKline) is available in a 100-mL amber glass bottle sealed with a synthetic butyl rubber stopper and aluminum collar. There are 100 mg of SbV per mL. Pentostam also contains chlorocresol BP, glucono-delta-lactone HSE, and sterile water for injection.
- 2. MA (Glucantime, Sanofi-Aventis) is available in 5-mL glass ampoules, each containing 85 mg SbV per mL.
- 3. Generic SSG manufactured by Albert David Ltd. (Calcutta, India) is available in multi-dose vials. Thirty mL contains SSG equivalent to 100 mg SbV in each mL.
- 4. There are many other manufacturers of SbV products around the world. The manufacturing consistency and quality of these products are not known.

#### **INDICATIONS**

Treatment of visceral leishmaniasis, cutaneous leishmaniasis, and mucosal leishmaniasis.[1](#page-1-0) SbV is of less utility for the treatment of leishmaniasis recidivans, diffuse cutaneous leishmaniasis, and post-kala azar dermal leishmaniasis, as these syndromes require extended dose regimens.

### **MODE OF ACTION**

Not completely known. May inhibit parasite trypanothione reductase (SbV prodrug of SbIII). SSG is a potent inhibitor of protein tyrosine phosphatases, leading to an accelerated cytokine response.

# **PHARMACOKINETICS**

After intravenous (IV) or intramuscular (IM) administration of sodium stibogluconate, antimony is excreted rapidly via the kidneys, with the majority of the dose being detected in the first 12-hour urine collection. This rapid excretion is reflected by a marked fall in serum or whole-blood antimony levels to approximately 1% to 4% of the peak level by 8 hours after an IV dose. During daily administration, there is a slow accumulation of SSG into the central compartment so that tissue concentrations reach a theoretical maximum level after at least 7 days.

# **DOSE ADJUSTMENTS IN RENAL FAILURE**

There are no studies, although most authorities recommend very careful monitoring if given to individuals with significant renal compromise.

# **DOSE ADJUSTMENTS IN LIVER FAILURE**

There are no data in humans. High concentrations of antimony are found in the livers of animals after repeated dosage with SbV. Pentavalent antimonial drugs should therefore be used with caution in patients with hepatic disease.

#### **DOSE**

Twenty mg SbV/kg/day for 10 to 28 days depending on the clinical syndrome and parasite being treated. Older literature and current drug labels may still reference an upper limit of 850 mg given daily; however, the current recommendation is for 20 mg/kg without reference to an upper limit[.1,2](#page-1-0)

# **ROUTE OF ADMINISTRATION**

SbV is given by IV, IM, or intralesional (IL) injection. There are no oral forms of the drug.

Due to the presence of particulates (size range: 20–300 µm) Pentostam solution should be drawn up through a filter immediately before administration. These particulates are insoluble complexes formed by an interaction between product preservative and the antioxidant in the rubber stopper. Filters of pore size ≤5 µm and membrane types polyvinylidene difluoride, polyethersulphone, polysulphone, nylon, surfactant-free cellulose acetate, and mixed cellulose esters have been shown to be suitable. Where sterile filters are not available, the risks and benefits of administering unfiltered Pentostam therapy should be assessed by the clinician on an individual basis.

#### **HOW TO GIVE THE DRUG**

IV: The appropriate weight-determined dose can be added to 250 mL of dextrose and water and infused slowly over 20 to 30 minutes via a peripheral antecubital vein. Access can be obtained with a "butterfly" steel needle placed daily. Patients do not require an indwelling plastic catheter.

# **ADVERSE EVENTS AND SERIOUS ADVERSE EVENTS**

- • Immediate reactions: In the unlikely event of coughing, vomiting, or substernal pain, administration should be discontinued immediately. In such cases, extreme care should be taken if Pentostam is re-administered by this route.
- • Gastrointestinal: Some degree of anorexia, nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, and/or abdominal pain is very common. Transient rises in serum lipase and amylase, sometimes quite elevated, usually occur during treatment with SSG. Symptomatic pancreatitis and deaths caused by pancreatitis have been reported. SbV commonly causes mild elevation (twofold to fivefold increase) of hepatic enzymes in serum, which later return to normal.
- • Systemic: Malaise, headache, and lethargy.
- • Musculoskeletal: Myalgias and arthralgias are quite common. Large joint (shoulders, hips) arthralgias can be quite severe, are dose dependent, and tend to become apparent by day 7 to 10 of treatment. Non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs

(NSAIDs) offer minimal relief, but usually once the drug is stopped they resolve promptly.

- • Cardiac: Electrocardiogram (ECG) changes, including reduction in T-wave amplitude, T-wave inversion, and QT prolongation, are commonly observed. Prolongation of the QTc interval has been observed in some patients taking SSG and appears to be dose related. There have also been reports of fatal cardiac arrhythmias in patients receiving higher-dose antimonial therapy for visceral leishmaniasis. Therefore ECG monitoring is recommended before and during (at least weekly) therapy with SSG. Where ECG monitoring is not available, the risks and benefits of SSG therapy should be assessed on an individual basis. If clinically significant prolongation of QTc interval occurs, SSG should be discontinued. ECG changes, notably alterations in T-wave amplitude, may be expected in the majority of patients given SSG. These appear to be reversible on cessation of therapy and are not of serious significance. SSG should be used with caution in patients with cardiovascular disease, a history of ventricular arrhythmias, or other risk factors known to predispose toward QT prolongation—for example, those with congenital QTc prolongation or taking concomitant drugs known to significantly prolong the QT interval (e.g., class III anti-arrhythmics such as sotalol and amiodarone).
- • Respiratory: Transient coughing immediately after injection was reported with varying frequency during several trials.
- • Hematologic: Transient reductions in platelets, white blood cells, and hemoglobin are not uncommon.
- • Other (rarely reported) side effects include fever,rigor,sweating, vertigo, angioedema, urticaria, facial flushing, worsening of lesions on the cheek, bleeding from the nose or gums, substernal pain, jaundice, and rash. IV injection of undiluted Pentostam may cause transient pain along the course of the vein and eventually thrombosis of that vein. Reactivation of herpes viruses near the end of therapy may be seen (herpes zoster, herpes simplex).

#### **KEY DRUG INTERACTIONS**

There are no known drug interactions. Past reports of sudden cardiac death have been reported when patients were treated with amphotericin B after they failed treatment with SbV. A washout period between amphotericin and SbV is recommended.

# **CONTRAINDICATIONS**

Pentostam should not be given to any patient who has experienced a serious adverse reaction to a previous dose. Pentostam should not be given to any patient with significantly impaired renal function, as kidneys are the route of excretion.

#### **USE IN SPECIAL POPULATIONS**

#### **Pregnancy**

SbV is contraindicated in pregnancy.

#### **Lactation**

SbV is found in breast milk after IV dosing[.3](#page-1-1) Children should usually not be breastfed by mothers receiving Pentostam, although breastfeeding infants are unlikely to be exposed to detectable or toxic antimony levels based on this single analysis[.1](#page-1-0)

# **Pediatrics**

SbV is used in infants, children, and adolescents[.1](#page-1-0) Young children may need higher weight-adjusted doses to achieve SbV plasma levels similar to adults.

# **Elderly (Age >60 Years)**

There is little information on the effects of pentavalent antimonial drugs on elderly individuals.

#### **RESISTANCE**

Therapeutic failures occur worldwide in all forms of leishmaniasis. Therapeutic failures likely due to resistance are especially high in Bihar, India, for visceral leishmaniasis.

# **STORAGE**

All products are light sensitive and should be stored in the dark. Do not freeze and do not store at temperatures >25°C.

# **AVAILABILITY IN THE UNITED STATES**

No SbV products are approved by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) for any indication. Pentostam is available under an Investigational New Drug (IND) application for civilians from the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) ([https://www.cdc.gov/parasites/leishmaniasis/health\\_professionals/](https://www.cdc.gov/parasites/leishmaniasis/health_professionals/index.html) [index.html\)](https://www.cdc.gov/parasites/leishmaniasis/health_professionals/index.html) and for U.S. military personnel from the Force Health Protection Division, U.S. Army Medical Materiel and Development Activity (USAMMDA), Ft. Detrick, Maryland.

#### **COMMENTS ON USE**

When serious or bothersome adverse events such as epigastric pain, marked chemical pancreatitis, and pancytopenias occur, briefly stopping SbV (a "drug holiday") for 2 to 4 days until symptoms are resolving and laboratory abnormalities are returning to baseline is recommended. Interestingly, these symptoms and laboratory abnormalities do not recur when re-starting the drug at previous dose levels.
