#### **PARASITISM**

#### **Definitions**

Parasite comes from the Greek word *parasitos* and is defined as "a plant or an animal which lives upon or within another living organism at whose expense it obtains some advantage." Parasitism is a type of symbiosis in which an intimate and obligatory relationship exists between two heterospecific organisms. The parasite, generally the smaller of the two, is usually metabolically dependent on its host. This association may be beneficial to both (mutualism), beneficial to one with little effect on the other (commensalism), or beneficial to one and detrimental to the other (parasitism). The term *parasite* is generally reserved for animal species of protozoa, helminths, and arthropods.

# **NATURAL HISTORY**

# **Host**

The organism on or within which the parasite lives is called the *host.* The life cycle of the parasite may take place in a single host species (e.g., *Entamoeba histolytica*: human), in two host species (e.g., *Plasmodium vivax*: human and mosquito), or in more than two host species (e.g., *Clonorchis sinensis*: human, snail, and cyprinoid fish).

<span id="page-0-0"></span>A definitive host (e.g., humans for *Taenia saginata*) is one in which a parasite undergoes sexual reproduction. Humans may be the only definitive host for some parasites (e.g., *Trichomonas vaginalis*), whereas others may have several definitive hosts (e.g., bushbuck, other game animals, and humans for *Trypanosoma brucei rhodesiense*). Animals that harbor a parasite that is pathogenic for other animals are called *reservoir hosts* (e.g., dogs for *Leishmania infantum*). Parasites that have reservoir hosts (e.g., *Brugia malayi*) are more difficult to eradicate than those that do not (e.g., *Wuchereria bancrofti*); the reservoir host serves as an alternate in the life cycle, thus increasing the chance of transmission and survival.

The animal in which the larval or asexual stage habitates (e.g., freshwater snail for *Schistosoma* species) is known as the *intermediate host.* A transfer or paratenic host (e.g., large predator fish for *Diphyllobothrium latum*) is not necessary for the completion of the life cycle of the parasite but is utilized as a temporary refuge and vehicle for reaching the obligatory or definitive host. An incidental host is one that is accidentally infected and is not required for the parasite's survival or development (e.g., humans for *Toxoplasma gondii* and *Leishmania*).

#### **Vector**

A vector (from the Latin *vehere,* to carry), usually an arthropod, transfers an infectious agent from one host to another. The parasite may develop or multiply within the body of the vector before becoming infective, in which case the vector is called a *biologic vector.* Biologic vectors are actually hosts—definitive hosts in the case of anopheline mosquitoes for human *Plasmodium* species or intermediate hosts in the case of *Cyclops* species for *Dracunculus medinensis.* A mechanical vector carries a parasite from one host to another but is not essential for the parasite's life cycle (e.g., houseflies for *Entamoeba histolytica*).

#### **PROTOZOA**

#### **Definitions**

Protozoa, derived from the Greek words, *protos,* meaning first or primary, and *zoon,* meaning animal, is a phylum comprising some of the morphologically simplest organisms of the animal kingdom. Most species are unicellular, eukaryotic, and microscopic in size; most are free-living and motile, but some have commensalistic, mutualistic, or parasitic relationships. Approximately 10,000 of the described living species are parasitic. Protozoa infect most vertebrate and invertebrate species and have developed the capacity to adapt to living in most host organs. To date about 80 protozoan human pathogens have been described.

The parasitic protozoa, unlike almost all helminths, can replicate (sexually, asexually, or both ways) within the host's body—a phenomenon that largely explains their survival, as well as the overwhelming infections that develop from single exposures.

#### **CLASSIFICATION**

It remains convenient to divide protozoa pathogenic to man into four phyla or subphyla (or superclasses in the case of the sporozoa) according to their type of locomotion: (1) Sarcodina (amebae), (2) Mastigophora (flagellates), (3) Ciliophora (ciliates), and (4) Sporozoa. It should be noted that this classification is by morphologic characteristics, and molecular techniques are contributing to frequent changes in taxonomy. Those interested may follow UniEuk [\(http://www.unieuk.org/](http://www.unieuk.org/)).

#### **Sarcodina**

Ameboid movements produce pseudopods in the Sarcodina. Reproduction is almost exclusively asexual, usually by binary fission. Amebae that infect man include *E. histolytica* (Chapter 94). Other species of Sarcodina that can be parasitic (e.g., *Naegleria fowleri,* normally a free-living organism), mutualistic, or commensalistic (e.g., *E. hartmanni* and *E. coli*) are covered in Chapter 107. Most are parasites or commensals of the gastrointestinal tract.

### **Mastigophora**

Flagella produce a whiplike motion. Most species, like those of the Sarcodina, have both cysts (transmission stage) and trophozoites (proliferative stage). Flagellates that infect man include *Giardia lamblia* (Chapter 95); *T. vaginalis* (Chapter 100); *Trypanosoma brucei gambiense, T. b. rhodesiense,* and *Trypanosoma cruzi* (Chapters 102 and 103); and *Leishmania* species (Chapter 104). Species in this group are capable of infecting many different tissues and cells.

# **Ciliophora**

Cilia supply the motion in this subphylum. They have two kinds of nuclei: a macronucleus and a micronucleus. Reproduction is by asexual transverse binary fission and sexual conjugation. *Balantidium coli,* the largest intestinal parasite of man, is a ciliate (Chapter 99).

#### **Sporozoa**

Protozoa in this subphylum typically have no locomotor organs in the adult stage(s) and reproduce alternately by asexual multiplication (schizogony) and sexual multiplication (sporogony). They are exclusively parasitic. Pathogens of man in this group include *Plasmodium* species (Chapter 101); *T. gondii* (Chapter 106); *Cryptosporidium parvum* (Chapter 96); *Cyclospora* (Chapter 97); and *Sarcospora, Microspora,* and *Cystoisospora* (Chapters 98, 108 and 109). Based upon ribosomal gene analysis, *Pneumocystis carinii* (Chapter 91) is now considered to be a fungus.

#### **PHYSIOLOGY**

With the exception of the Sarcodina trophozoites, which have an ectoplastic covering, protozoa have cell membranes.

#### **Ectoplasm**

Across this membrane, nutrients can be actively transported, phagocytized, or moved by pinocytosis. Some species have a peristome through which food passes directly into the cytostome and cytopharynx to the endoplasm.

#### **Endoplasm**

Protozoa are eukaryotic; some have multiple nuclei. Cytoplasmic inclusions and a variety of organelles are responsible for metabolic, reproductive, and protective functions.

#### **Reproduction**

Asexual or binary fission-type reproduction is characteristic of the Sarcodina, Mastigophora, and Ciliophora. In some species, asexual reproduction is more complex. Sexual reproduction in the Sporozoa always takes place in the definitive host (e.g., mosquito for malarial parasites, cat for *T. gondii*); it results in the formation of a zygote. Asexual reproduction occurs in the intermediate host (e.g., humans for malarial parasites and for *T. gondii*).

#### **TRANSMISSION**

#### **Intestinal Protozoa**

These are usually transmitted from host to host by the fecal–oral route via food and water. Many species have a cystic stage that is capable of resisting adverse environmental conditions (e.g., drying, heat, and cold). *T. gondii* is also transmitted by ingestion of undercooked meat (contaminated with cysts) or soil, food, or other vehicles contaminated with cat feces (contaminated with oocysts).

#### **Blood and Tissue Protozoa**

Most of these have two hosts: vertebrate (man) and an invertebrate vector (arthropod); see Chapters 146 and 147. The parasite is usually transmitted by the vector's bite (e.g., in infections with *Plasmodium* species, *T. b. gambiense* and *T. b. rhodesiense, Leishmania* species, or *Babesia* species) or by exposure to contaminated vector feces (e.g., in infections with *T. cruzi*).

# **MAGNITUDE OF THE HEALTH PROBLEM**

Protozoal infections cause man more disease and misery than any other group of infectious agents.

#### **Malaria**

Infections with *Plasmodium* species remain one of the greatest causes of mortality and morbidity in the world today, particularly in children under 5 years of age and in pregnant women. The World Health Organization (WHO) has set a long-term goal of control of transmission with drugs, insecticide-treated bed nets, and indoor residual spraying of insecticides and selected intensive efforts at local elimination. The continuing development of resistance to insecticides by the anopheline vectors has meant that new chemicals are required, and these are often too expensive to be used by those who need them most.

Multiple drug–resistant *P. falciparum* is widespread in Southeast Asia into the Indian subcontinent, the Western Pacific, and in malaria-endemic areas of South America and sub-Saharan Africa. During the mid-1990s, some strains of *P. vivax* in Indonesia, New Guinea, the Solomon Islands, and northern South America developed resistance to chloroquine, complicating and increasing the cost of treatment of this species as well.

Estimates of the numbers infected and dying from malaria vary widely and are often inaccurate because of a lack of specific parasitologic confirmation. Recently the WHO has recommended that all cases of fever be confirmed as being caused by malaria before giving anti-malarial treatments. In endemic areas, most individuals exposed to infectious bites have low levels of asexual parasites and gametocytes in the peripheral blood. The introduction of non-microscopic rapid diagnostic tests that can detect circulating antigens of *Plasmodia* can provide confirmation of malaria infection where quality microscopic diagnosis is not available.

#### **African Trypanosomiasis**

Infection with either *T. b. gambiense* or *T. b. rhodesiense* almost always causes severe human illness. If untreated, it is fatal; fortunately, however, relatively few people are infected. *T. b. brucei,* which is morphologically identical to the subspecies causing human sleeping sickness (Chapter 102), causes infection in cattle (nagana) across much of Central and East Africa. Thus cattle raising is limited, greatly interfering with economic development and with the nutritional status of the entire area but probably protecting the environment from overgrazing. An increase in fatal cases of human African trypanosomiasis was reported in the late 1990s and early 2000s, particularly in Angola, the Democratic Republic of Congo, and southern Sudan due to a collapse in health care infrastructure and delivery associated with conflicts. In 2009 after intensive control efforts, the number of cases reported has dropped below 10,000 (9878) for the first time in 50 years.

#### **American Trypanosomiasis**

*T. cruzi* affects as many as 15 million people living in South and Central America. Although acute infections may be fatal, most infections are not detected (Chapter 103). Unfortunately, chronic complications years later often lead to severe disability and death from Chagas-related cardiomyopathy and the "mega" syndromes. The poor, who live in crudely built huts infested with the Reduviid vector, "the kissing bug," contract Chagas disease. Infection can be transmitted transplacentally from mother to fetus and by blood transfusion. Increasing immigration from Central and South America to the United States led to concern regarding the safety of blood transfusions and Food and Drug Administration (FDA) approval of the first blood screening tests in the United States for Chagas disease in 2006. Over 2300 confirmed positive cases of Chagas disease have been detected via the new blood donor screening policies as of 2018.

#### **Leishmaniasis**

*Leishmania* species infect millions worldwide and cause clinical syndromes varying from a minimal, single, self-healing chronic ulceration (localized cutaneous leishmaniasis) to a severe, and often fatal, febrile illness (kala-azar [Chapter 104]). *Leishmania* species causing these different syndromes appear morphologically identical. Polymorphisms can be detected, however, by using biochemical, immunologic, and genetic techniques that correlate with epidemiologic and clinical differences. Improved diagnosis, including molecular techniques, has demonstrated more cases of subclinical and mild infections than of the characteristic symptomatic diseases. Patients with silent chronic infections with species causing visceral disease (i.e., *Leishmania donovani* or *L. infantum*) sometimes develop visceral leishmaniasis when they become immunocompromised.

#### **CONCLUSION**

Essential to the recognition of protozoal infections is knowledge of the epidemiology (risk factors, geographic distribution) and awareness of the typical clinical presentation. No longer are these diseases of remote regions; with global travel and immigration, protozoal infections appear in North America, where all clinicians need awareness of their clinical characteristics. The effects of immunocompromising conditions, whether as a consequence of modern medicine or HIV infection, permit reactivation of chronic infections remote in time from when they were acquired. Diagnosis and management of protozoan infections often need specialized tools and expertise, but most importantly is that a provider consider protozoan infections in their differential diagnosis when appropriate.
