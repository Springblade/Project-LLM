# **74** Typhoid and Paratyphoid (Enteric) Fever

*Jason B. Harris, W. Abdullah Brooks*

# KEY FEATURES

- • *Salmonella enterica* serotypes Typhi and Paratyphi A, B, and C are the causative agents of typhoid and paratyphoid (enteric) fever.
- • Enteric fever is a non-specific illness characterized by prolonged fevers and persistent bacteremia.
- • Life-threatening complications of enteric fever include intestinal hemorrhage, perforation, and encephalopathy.
- • The diagnosis of enteric fever should be considered in any patient with prolonged fever and exposure in an endemic area.
- • Because of the limitations of diagnostic tests, the initiation of antibiotic treatment for enteric fever is often based on a presumptive diagnosis.
- • The choice of empiric antibiotic therapy depends on local patterns of antibiotic resistance. Drug resistance is of increasing concern.
- • The World Health Organization (WHO) endorses the use of typhoid vaccines in control programs, with typhoid conjugate vaccine (TCV) being the preferred vaccine. The WHO recommends the introduction of TCV to be prioritized in countries with the highest burden of typhoid fever or a high burden of antimicrobial resistance.

# **INTRODUCTION**

Typhoid and paratyphoid fever are systemic febrile illnesses caused by *Salmonella enterica* serotype Typhi and serotypes Paratyphi A, B, or C, respectively. Enteric fever refers to either typhoid or paratyphoid fever. *S.* Typhi is the predominant cause of enteric fever and may be the world's most common cause of bacteremia [\(Box 74.1\)](#page-1-0).

Both typhoid and paratyphoid fever are characterized by prolonged fever and sustained bacteremia. The name *typhoid*, meaning "typhus like," was coined in 1829 and reflects the difficulty physicians had in differentiating the illness from epidemic typhus. Among 19th-century American physicians, *typho-malaria* was a common diagnosis, indicative of the difficulty differentiating typhoid from other causes of persistent fever. This proved fortuitous in 1948, when two patients were referred for a study of the efficacy of chloramphenicol in scrub typhus but were subsequently found to have *S.* Typhi bacteremia. Both patients improved rapidly after antibiotic therapy, a finding that ushered in the post-antibiotic era in typhoid fever.[1](#page-7-0)

#### **EPIDEMIOLOGY**

#### **Incidence and Distribution of Enteric Fever**

#### Typhoid Fever

*S.* Typhi causes approximately 12 to 25 million cases of typhoid fever annually with an estimated mortality of 1%[.2](#page-7-1) The regions with the highest incidence are South-central Asia (≈1000 cases/100,000 person-years) and Southeast Asia (≈100 cases/100,000 person-years). The incidence of typhoid fever varies in sub-Saharan Africa, but major epidemics of typhoid fever that occur in some parts of sub-Saharan Africa have a high incidence (≈1000 cases/100,000 person-years) [\(Fig. 74.1](#page-2-0)).

#### Paratyphoid Fever

*S.* Paratyphi A is the most common cause of paratyphoid fever and causes up to 5 million cases of enteric fever annually[,3](#page-7-2) although this may be an underestimation, as many cases of typhoid fever in highly endemic areas are assigned clinically to *S.* Typhi and might be *S.* Paratyphi. The proportion of cases of enteric fever caused by *S.* Paratyphi A has increased and now ranges from 20% to 50% in parts of southern Asia.[3](#page-7-2) This is significant, as current typhoid fever vaccines do not protect against *S.* Paratyphi A. Serotypes Paratyphi B and C are rare causes of enteric fever.

# **Transmission and Patterns of Infection**

# Source of Infection

*S.* Typhi and *S.* Paratyphi A, B, and C are human-restricted pathogens; no known animal reservoirs exist. Enteric fever patients shed organisms in the stool during acute illness and often for months after convalescence. In the pre-antibiotic era, up to 3% of typhoid fever survivors developed chronic asymptomatic bacterial shedding in the stool. Chronic carriage can persist for life, and gallbladder disease is the major risk factor for carriage. A study in Nepal found that 5% of individuals undergoing elective cholecystectomy for gallstones grew *S.* Typhi or *S.* Paratyphi A from biliary cultures[.4](#page-7-3) Although chronic carriers are a source of transmission where disease is sporadic, it is unclear whether carriers are an important reservoir in endemic areas.

#### Mode of Transmission

In endemic areas, most infections are acquired via contaminated food or water, with water playing the greater role in endemic urban settings. The inoculum required to produce disease in 50% of adult volunteers (ID50) is 107 organisms, though as few as 103 organisms may produce disease. Risk factors include drinking non-boiled water and eating food prepared outside the home. Although direct contact with a typhoid fever patient is an infection risk factor, more than 80% of cases occur in individuals with no known contact[.5](#page-7-4) In South-central and Southeast Asia, peak transmission occurs during monsoon season, although disease is present year-round. Large waterborne epidemics may be superimposed on endemic seasonality.

#### Antimicrobial Resistance

Chloramphenicol-resistant *S.* Typhi was described in 1950, 2 years after the antibiotic was first used to treat typhoid fever. Multi-drug–resistant *S.* Typhi, carrying plasmid-mediated resistance to chloramphenicol, ampicillin, trimethoprim, and sulfonamides, became common in the 1980s, and nalidixic acid–resistant *S.* Typhi and *S.* Paratyphi A in the 1990s. Nalidixic acid–resistant strains are associated with decreased susceptibility to fluoroquinolones, an increased risk of treatment failure, and increased mortality.[6](#page-7-5) In

#### <span id="page-1-0"></span>**BOX 74.1** Nomenclature of *Salmonella* Infections

The multiple microbiologic, serologic, and clinical designations applied to *Salmonella* infections are confusing[.40](#page-8-0) Most pathogenic *Salmonella* belong to a single subspecies designated *Salmonella enterica* subspecies enterica. In addition to this species designation, *Salmonella* are classified serologically. The serogroup is assigned based on the O antigen alone, whereas the serotype designation, from which the name is derived, is based on both the O and H antigens.

*Salmonella enterica* subsp. enterica includes over 1400 serotypes. Although the full name of the cause of typhoid fever is *Salmonella enterica* subsp. enterica serotype Typhi, it is normally just shortened to *S.* Typhi. Although serogroup designation is performed routinely in many laboratories, the test lacks clinical utility. Complete serotype identification is often performed in a reference laboratory; however, *S.* Typhi and Paratyphi A can also be identified by biochemical tests in a routine microbiology laboratory. Identification of *S.* Typhi and Paratyphi A are reviewed in detail in the World Health Organization's, "The diagnosis, treatment and prevention of typhoid fever."[24](#page-8-1)

Clinically *Salmonella* are classified as typhoidal or nontyphoidal. The typhoidal serotypes are *S.* Typhi and Paratyphi A, B, and C. All others are classified as non-typhoidal. However, this is also misleading, as many non-typhoidal strains also cause invasive infection, which may mimic typhoid fever (see Chapter 49).

Examples of Clinical and Serologic Classification of Pathogenic *Salmonella*

Asia, most *S.* Typhi and Paratyphi A strains are now nalidixic acid resistant. In the past decade, complete resistance to ciprofloxacin and extended-spectrum cephalosporins has emerged[.7](#page-7-6) Although resistance to these newer agents is increasing, susceptibility to original first-line agents may be re-emerging, at least in some locations. Thus antimicrobial resistance in *S.* Typhi and Paratyphi A varies significantly by region and patterns of antibiotic use.

#### Severity

The majority of cases are not severe enough to require hospitalization. Case fatality prevalence for typhoid fever patients in the pre-antibiotic era was approximately 15%. Current hospital-based mortality rates range by location (0%–15%), with a median mortality rate of 2%.[8](#page-7-7) In the United States, where disease is sporadic, the fatality rate of reported cases is 0.2%.[9](#page-7-8)

#### Age and Immunity

In the most highly endemic communities, the incidence of enteric fever is highest in children between 1 and 5 years. In such areas, *S.* Typhi is the leading cause of bacteremia in children and may be responsible for over 75% of cases of occult bacteremia.[10](#page-7-9) In less endemic areas, the median age of patients with typhoid fever increases. Relapse and recurrent infections among patients who have recovered from typhoid fever demonstrate that immunity is neither lifelong nor universally acquired after a single illness.

# Sporadic Disease and Travelers

In countries where typhoid fever is sporadic (<1/100,000 personyears), most cases are imported through travel. In the United States over 85% of cases are travel related, and most of these cases occur in travelers returning from South Asia. Many remaining cases can be traced to small foodborne outbreaks and/or a chronic carrier.[9](#page-7-8) The risk of travel-related enteric fever is higher among travelers visiting friends and relatives.[11](#page-7-10)

# **NATURAL HISTORY, PATHOGENESIS, AND PATHOLOGY**

#### **Invasion and Latency**

*S.* Typhi and *S.* Paratyphi A, B, and C are rod-shaped, gram-negative bacteria that have adapted to survive and replicate in human macrophages. *S.* Typhi and Paratyphi breach the intestinal barrier through specialized microfold cells (M cells) that transport the bacteria across the basolateral membrane where they are phagocytosed by macrophages in the intestinal lymphoid tissue. This invasion phase of infection is usually asymptomatic but may be accompanied by transient diarrhea in 10% to 20% of patients. Latent infection typically lasts 1 to 2 weeks (range 3–60 days), depending on the number of organisms ingested.

# **Disseminated Infection**

Typhoidal *Salmonella* deploy an array of virulence factors that enable them to persist and replicate in an intracellular compartment.[12](#page-7-11) Intracellular organisms disseminate throughout the reticuloendothelial tissues via the blood and lymphatic system. Infection is established in the intestinal lymphoid tissue, liver, spleen, gallbladder, and bone marrow.

Patients with typhoid fever generally have low-grade bacteremia. The median number of culturable bacteria is less than 1 per mL of whole blood and 10 per mL of bone marrow in patients with typhoid fever. The proportion of bacteria in the bone marrow increases over the course of the illness[.13](#page-7-12) Infection results in the secretion of inflammatory cytokines, which cause prolonged fever.

Burden of typhoid fever in low-income and middle-income countries: a systematic, literature-based update with risk-factor adjustment. Lancet Glob Health 2014;2:e570–80.)

However, unlike prototypical gram-negative bacteremia, overt sepsis with hypotension and neutrophilia is rare.

# **Pathologic Findings**

Intestinal lymphoid tissue is the major site of localized inflammation in enteric fever. Peyer's patches in the terminal ileum and draining mesenteric nodes become enlarged and contain infiltrates consisting predominantly of macrophages and lymphocytes[.14](#page-7-14) As the disease progresses, necrosis of the intestinal lymphoid tissue may occur, with ulceration of the overlying intestinal mucosa. This can lead to hemorrhage or intestinal perforation, life-threatening complications of enteric fever. Other affected organs include the spleen, with nodular monocytic infiltrates in the red pulp, and liver, with small monocytic infiltrates and foci of parenchymal necrosis ("typhoid nodules"). Monocytic infiltrates also occur in the bone marrow and gallbladder.

# **Relapse and Chronic Carriage**

Untreated, typhoid fever may persist for 3 to 4 weeks. Relapse occurs in 5% to 10% of untreated cases, usually within 2 weeks of resolution of the fever. The gallbladder is the primary site of chronic carriage. The observation that *S. enterica* forms biofilms on cholesterol gallstones may explain the association between gallstones and carriage[.15](#page-7-15)

#### **CLINICAL FEATURES**

The clinical features of enteric fever are non-specific. The major clinical findings are listed in [Table 74.1](#page-2-2). Fever, without localizing signs or symptoms, may be the sole manifestation of enteric fever. In highly endemic countries, a typical presentation in young children may be nothing more than a fever ≥39°C for 3 or more days.

Most enteric fever cases are diagnosed in the ambulatory setting and are mild, and up to 90% are treated as outpatients[.16](#page-7-13) In contrast, classic descriptions of typhoid fever are based on hospitalized patients with more severe disease. Although life-threatening complications of enteric fever usually occur more than a week

<span id="page-2-1"></span><sup>\*</sup>The proportion of patients demonstrating these clinical features of enteric fever varies depending on the time, region, and type of clinical population (hospitalized or ambulatory) assessed. Estimates are drawn from recent case series in an endemic area presenting for ambulatory or inpatient care[.16,38](#page-7-13)

after fever onset, both intestinal perforation and encephalopathy may occur within days of initial fever.

Historically, paratyphoid fever was considered less severe than typhoid fever. Current evidence suggests that infections caused by *S.* Typhi and *S.* Paratyphi A are clinically indistinguishable and equally severe.[17](#page-7-16)

# **Mild Illness**

Enteric fever is usually insidious. Fever may increase gradually over the first week of illness. Headache, anorexia, malaise, and other non-specific flulike symptoms are common and may precede fever. Abdominal complaints, including diarrhea, constipation, and non-localizing abdominal pain, occur in less than a third of cases but may raise clinical suspicion.[17](#page-7-16)

Physical findings are also non-specific. Relative bradycardia, or pulse-temperature dissociation, is considered a classic sign of enteric fever, but there is no widely accepted definition of relative bradycardia, and little evidence that it is a useful predictor.[18](#page-7-17) Rose spots are small, blanching, pink macular lesions, typically 2 to 4 mm, which usually occur on the chest, abdomen, and/or back during the second week of illness but are infrequently observed. A white, yellow, or brown coating of the tongue that spares the tongue's edges is common. Mild abdominal tenderness may be present. Hepatomegaly and splenomegaly, if present, are usually modest.

In contrast to other causes of bacteremia, patients with enteric fever rarely demonstrate leukocytosis, neutrophilia, or increased immature neutrophils. A typical leukocyte count is 5 to 8 × 106 cells per mL, with 60% to 75% neutrophils,[17](#page-7-16) and helps with the differential diagnosis in endemic settings with a high prevalence of other invasive bacterial diseases. However, neither leukocytosis nor leukopenia excludes enteric fever. Hematocrit and platelet counts are usually normal or slightly low. Modest elevations, typically double the upper end of the normal range, in the aspartate transaminase and alanine transaminase, are common. Excessive levels of blood transaminases should prompt concern for other etiologies, including viral hepatitis.

# **Severe Illness and Complications**

Patients with severe enteric fever are ill or toxic appearing and generally have been febrile for longer than 1 week. They are likely to have moderate abdominal pain or tenderness and either constipation or diarrhea. Moderate hepatomegaly and splenomegaly are also common.

The major complications of typhoid fever are listed in [Table](#page-3-0) [74.2](#page-3-0). Complications associated with increased mortality include intestinal hemorrhage and perforation, severe encephalopathy, seizures, and pneumonia,[19](#page-7-18) although pneumonia has also been noted frequently in children without other complications.[10](#page-7-9)

#### **Gastrointestinal Complications**

Some degree of intestinal hemorrhage occurs in up to 10% of hospitalized patients; this is usually self-limited. Intestinal perforation [\(Fig. 74.2](#page-3-1)) occurs in up to 3% of hospitalized patients and is associated with substantial mortality. A recent series of 27 cases of intestinal perforation demonstrated that the median length of illness preceding perforation was 9 days (range 1–22 days) from the onset of fever.[20](#page-7-19) Perforation is suggested by clinical signs of sepsis and peritonitis, including tachycardia, leukocytosis with predominant neutrophilia, and abdominal pain with guarding and rebound tenderness. Radiographic evidence of pneumoperitoneum may be present in only 50% of cases. Perforation may be difficult to recognize, as patients may be toxic appearing with accompanying abdominal tenderness even before perforation.

#### **Neurologic Complications**

Severe enteric fever may present with encephalopathy. A history of confusion is common, and patients often demonstrate an apathetic affect. Severe encephalopathy manifested by delirium, stupor, and coma occurs in a smaller number of hospitalized patients and is associated with a high risk of mortality[.19,21,22](#page-7-18) Seizures are most common in young children and are associated with increased mortality risk[.19](#page-7-18) Even in severe encephalopathy or seizure cases, cerebrospinal fluid cultures are usually negative, and pleocytosis, if present, reveals fewer than 35 cells per µL[.21,22](#page-8-2) Meningitis is

uncommon and is seen primarily in infants. Focal neurologic findings have been reported but should prompt consideration of an alternative diagnosis.

#### **Other Complications**

Pneumonia is a serious co-morbidity associated with severe enteric fever[.19](#page-7-18) Although enteric fever is a disseminated bacterial infection, distal pyogenic complications are not common. This contrasts with invasive non-typhoidal *Salmonella,* in which osteomyelitis and endovascular infection occur more frequently. Numerous other enteric fever complications have been reported, affecting all major organ systems[.16](#page-7-13)

# **PATIENT EVALUATION, DIAGNOSIS, AND DIFFERENTIAL DIAGNOSIS**

Enteric fever can be a life-threatening infection if not treated with appropriate antimicrobial therapy and should be suspected in any patient with prolonged fever and exposure to an endemic area. There are no reliable clinical criteria to establish the diagnosis of enteric fever and no sensitive and specific diagnostic laboratory tests. Therefore the diagnosis of enteric fever is usually presumptive.

#### **Clinical Evaluation**

The first requirement for diagnosis is clinical suspicion. In a highly endemic area, 3 or more days of non-focal fever should prompt consideration of enteric fever. Patients should undergo a routine clinical history and physical examination. Although most of the findings associated with enteric fever are non-specific, many other causes of febrile illness will become apparent after a careful history and examination. Routine laboratory studies are also of limited value in establishing a diagnosis of enteric fever but may be more useful in eliminating other potential causes of non-focal fever.

In a highly endemic area, factors that should increase the clinical suspicion for enteric fever early in the course of the illness include young age, temperature above 39°C, ill appearance, and any abdominal complaints, including diarrhea, constipation, or abdominal pain.[10](#page-7-9) In the most highly endemic settings, 3 or more days of fever without localizing signs and a combination of any of these features in the absence of another obvious cause may be sufficient to prompt a diagnostic evaluation for enteric fever along with the initiation of empiric therapy.

As fever duration increases, the likelihood of enteric fever increases. Any patient with 7 or more days of unexplained fever from an area where enteric fever is endemic should undergo a diagnostic evaluation and empiric treatment should be considered, given the potential complications of untreated enteric fever[.16](#page-7-13)

#### **Differential Diagnosis**

The differential diagnosis should reflect local febrile disease prevalence. Malaria, dengue fever, influenza, leptospirosis, rickettsial infections, urinary tract infection, and other causes of childhood occult bacteremia (e.g., *Streptococcus pnuemoniae, Haemophilus influenzae,* and *Neisseria meningitiditis*) should all be considered in the differential diagnosis of fever without localizing signs. In patients with prolonged fever (>7 days) with or without localizing signs, the infectious differential diagnosis includes malaria, Epstein–Barr virus infection, tuberculosis, brucellosis, tularemia, plague, occult abscesses (including amebic liver abscess), and typhus.

#### **Microbiologic Diagnosis**

Although presumptive diagnosis of enteric fever is sufficient justification to initiate treatment in an ill-appearing patient, a definitive diagnosis of enteric fever can only be made by isolation of *S.* Typhi or *S.* Paratyphi A, B, or C from blood, bone marrow, or another normally sterile clinical specimen. The isolation of a causative organism also provides the opportunity to optimize antimicrobial therapy.

Isolation of *S.* Typhi or Paratyphi A is most commonly achieved by blood culture. Factors that affect the sensitivity of blood isolation include the culture medium, prior antibiotic exposure, blood volume, and the duration of illness before sample collection. A recent meta-analysis suggests that blood culture has an overall sensitivity of 60% for diagnosing typhoid fever[,23](#page-8-4) reflecting the low number of organisms present in the blood and prior antibiotic use. High blood volumes optimize the yield of blood culture; the WHO recommends that 10 to 15 mL of blood be obtained from school-aged children and 2 to 4 mL of blood be used for culture in toddlers and preschool-aged children.[24](#page-8-1) Although alternatives to standard blood culture (e.g., direct plating of the buffy coats or the use of selective ox bile media) have been recommended, the use of routine blood cultures with standard broth media is preferable because such methods may detect other potential bacterial pathogens as well.

Bone marrow cultures have an 80% to 95% sensitivity for isolating *S.* Typhi. Bone marrow cultures may remain positive for several days after initiating antibiotics. However, the invasiveness of bone marrow culture limits its practical utility in uncomplicated cases. Under optimal conditions, a single high-volume (>15 mL) blood culture in an adult has a sensitivity nearly equivalent to a 1-mL bone marrow culture.[13,24](#page-7-12)

Stool cultures are positive in over 50% and 30% of infected children and adults, respectively. Rectal swabs are not recommended, and the yield of stool cultures is optimized by the use of >1 gram of stool and a selective enrichment broth.[24](#page-8-1) Cultures obtained from intestinal biopsies of patients with perforation are rarely positive[.20](#page-7-19)

# **Serologic and Molecular Diagnosis**

The most commonly utilized diagnostic test for enteric fever is Widal's test, which was developed in 1896 and detects agglutinating antibodies against the O and H antigens of *S.* Typhi. Widal's test is not sufficiently sensitive, specific, or reliable enough to be an optimal diagnostic assay for typhoid fever, and it does not aid in the diagnosis of paratyphoid fever, because these antibodies are not cross-reactive against *S.* Paratyphi A, B, and C antigens. A false-negative Widal's test may result from the assay being performed early in the course of illness, and a false-positive Widal's test is more likely in an area of high endemicity, where antibodies may represent past infection.

Rapid serologic tests, including the IDL Tubex and Typhidot assays, are available. In principle, tests such as Tubex, which detects immunoglobulin M (IgM) antibodies to the O9 antigen—a T-cell–independent response to *Salmonella* infection, which is therefore rapid—and Typhidot, which detects both IgM and IgG to the 50 kD antigen of *S.* Typhi, should be useful in identifying early acute infection[.24](#page-8-1) However, in practice, these tests have met with mixed success in highly endemic settings because they have not consistently demonstrated an ability to distinguish between current and past infection, and in some cases, have not consistently been as sensitive as the Widal's test.[25,26](#page-8-5) Although diagnostic approaches based on the detection of anti-*Salmonella* IgA in secretions of peripheral blood lymphocytes are promising, these tests are not yet commercially available[.27](#page-8-3)

#### **TREATMENT AND PREVENTION OF ENTERIC FEVER**

Appropriate antibiotics and supportive care reduce the mortality of enteric fever from 10% to 15% to less than 1%. Fevers resolve after an average of 3 to 5 days of appropriate antibiotics, compared with 3 to 4 weeks in untreated infections. The widespread emergence of antibiotic-resistant *S.* Typhi and Paratyphi A complicates the choice of antibiotics. Most patients can be managed in an ambulatory setting.

## **Antibiotics for Enteric Fever**

Uncomplicated enteric fever is usually treated with a single antibacterial drug. Antimicrobial choice depends on patient age, their ability to take oral medications, and drug availability and cost. Knowledge of antibiotic resistance patterns is essential because in most cases, empiric antibiotics are initiated before an isolate is obtained. [Table 74.3](#page-5-0) summarizes antibiotic therapy for enteric fever.

# Chloramphenicol, Ampicillin, and Trimethoprim–Sulfamethoxazole

The original "first-line" therapies for enteric fever include chloramphenicol, ampicillin, and trimethoprim–sulfamethoxazole[.28](#page-8-7) After decades of increasing resistance among *S.* Typhi and Paratyphi A to these antibiotics, the trend may be reversing. Chloramphenicol results in a marked decrease in mortality and clearance of fevers

in 3 to 5 days. It is inexpensive, has excellent oral bioavailability, is available even in the poorest parts of the world, and has broadspectrum activity against other occult childhood bacterial infections (including bacteremia and meningitis caused by *H. influenzae, S. pneumoniae,* and *N. meningitides*). However, up to 1:20,000 patients develop fatal irreversible aplastic anemia. Also, chloramphenicol does not substantially reduce the risk of relapse and chronic carriage. Ampicillin and its oral formulation amoxicillin and trimethoprim– sulfamethoxazole are also inexpensive, broad-spectrum antibiotics that are effective against susceptible strains of *S.* Typhi and Paratyphi A, and are generally available in highly endemic settings. In populations with a known prevalence of G6PD deficiency, sulfonamides should generally be avoided.

# Fluoroquinolones and Nalidixic Acid–Resistant *S.* Typhi and *S.* Paratyphi A

Widespread acquisition of resistance to chloramphenicol, ampicillin, and trimethoprim–sulfamethoxazole led to the use of fluoroquinolones as the first-line therapy. However, this approach is now outdated in areas where strains with reduced susceptibility to fluoroquinolones predominate. This includes South and Southeast Asia, where increasing resistance has led to poor clinical responses to fluoroquinolones.

Recognizing the role of increasing quinolone resistance in poor treatment outcomes, the Clinical Laboratory and Standards Institute amended the criteria for susceptibility to quinolone antibiotics for *S.* Typhi and *S.* Paratyphi A, B, and C in 2012 and 2013. Before this time, nalidixic acid resistance (NaR) served as a marker for the potential for decreased clinical effectiveness of quinolone antibiotics. However, a complicating factor is that many laboratories are unable to test for these updated breakpoints in *S.* Typhi and Paratyphi isolates. For such strains, NaR may still serve as a useful marker of decreased susceptibility to fluoroquinolone antibiotics.

In the absence of resistance, ciprofloxacin and ofloxacin are highly efficacious in the treatment of enteric fever. Both have excellent oral bioavailability and result in rapid defervescence (an average of ≈3–4 days) and decreased rates of relapse and carriage compared with chloramphenicol and beta-lactam antibiotics. Concern about fluoroquinolone-induced cartilage toxicity in children is based on animal models; however, several studies support its safety in children.[29](#page-8-9) Gatifloxacin is a newer-generation fluoroquinolone that is available in many countries where enteric fever is endemic and has better efficacy in the treatment of uncomplicated enteric fever caused by NaR *Salmonella* relative to ofloxacin[.30](#page-8-10) However, results from a recent trial comparing gatifloxacin with ceftriaxone suggest that for quinolone-resistant strains, it is better to avoid gatifloxacin and use an alternative agent.[31](#page-8-6) A disadvantage is that gatifloxacin is associated with increased frequency of hypoglycemia and hyperglycemia compared with other fluoroquinolones, and for this reason was withdrawn from the U.S. market.

At present, due to widespread resistance, fluoroquinolones should only be used to treat patients with typhoid fever when the isolate is confirmed to be fluoroquinolone susceptible.

# Third-Generation Cephalosporins

The emergence of NaR strains with decreased fluoroquinolone susceptibility (and associated treatment failures) has caused a shift toward third-generation cephalosporins as first-line therapy in more severe cases, although this approach may take longer for defervescence and has a higher relapse rate.[29](#page-8-9) Ceftriaxone is an effective antibiotic for treating enteric fever, including cases caused by NaR isolates. However, ceftriaxone must be given parenterally, and short courses of ceftriaxone (≤7 days) are associated with high rates of relapse.[32](#page-8-11) Furthermore, clinical defervescence is often delayed, and longer courses of ceftriaxone may be required, depending on the clinical response.[33](#page-8-12) In such cases, treatment for at least 7 days post-defervescence can be considered. Cefixime is an oral third-generation cephalosporin that may be used to treat enteric fever, although short courses also result in high rates of relapse. Resistance to ceftriaxone and other extended-spectrum beta-lactam antibiotics is rare but increasing[.7](#page-7-6) Indeed, a recent outbreak of typhoid caused by an XDR strain of *S.* Typhi resistant to a number of antimicrobials including ceftriaxone and fluoroquinolones in Pakistan is particularly disconcerting[.34](#page-8-13)

#### Azithromycin

Azithromycin is an effective oral treatment for uncomplicated enteric fever, including enteric fever caused by NaR and multidrug–resistant isolates.[35](#page-8-8) A 7-day course of azithromycin appears to be as effective as gatifloxacin in the treatment of enteric fever caused by NaR isolates and results in lower rates of clinical failure and relapse compared with cefixime or ceftriaxone. Azithromycin is safe in children, has excellent bioavailability and pharmacokinetics with once-daily dosing, and reaches high intracellular concentrations, which may contribute to the high rates of cure seen after 7 days of therapy.

#### Supportive and Adjunctive Therapy

Adjunctive therapy is aimed at managing the inflammatory complications of infection. In a double-blind trial in Indonesia in the 1980s, a short course of high-dose intravenous dexamethasone initiated concurrently with the first dose of antibiotics significantly reduced mortality in critically ill patients with typhoid fever with shock and/or profound encephalopathy manifested as delirium or obtundation[.36](#page-8-14) In suspected cases of severe typhoid fever, dexamethasone should be administered along with intravenous antibiotics as soon as possible, usually before the results of blood cultures are obtained, and may be administered at an initial dose of 3 mg/kg IV, followed by 1 mg/kg IV every 6 hours for seven additional doses. Recent evidence continues to support the initial

administration of high-dose dexamethasone along with antibiotics in severe cases of enteric fever with shock or encephalopathy in adults and children.

Supportive care, including rehydration and nutritional management, is important in patients with enteric fever. Rehydration and nutritional supplementation can be managed according to WHO standards. Despite historical concerns regarding their use, debilitating fevers and malaise can be managed safely with antipyretics[.37](#page-8-15)

# **Management of Intestinal Complications**

Prompt surgical intervention in suspected cases of perforation is the mainstay of therapy. The majority of cases involve a single perforation along the anti-mesenteric border of the terminal ileum. However, careful inspection of the bowel is required, as multiple perforations are present in approximately 25% of patients and perforation can occur along the proximal or distal small bowel. Surrounding tissues are usually inflamed and friable. Although simple closure may be performed in some cases, wedge excision with debridement of the necrotic bowel or segmental resection is more often necessary. In cases of multiple perforations, more extensive resections and temporary ileostomy may be required. Drainage of fluid collections and peritoneal lavage should be performed before wound closure. Antibiotic coverage should be broadened to cover other intestinal flora, including anaerobes. Perforation-associated mortality rates are variable; early recognition, surgical intervention, and supportive care enhance survival[.20](#page-7-19)

Intestinal hemorrhage can usually be managed through supportive care. Blood products, including packed red cells and plasma, may be needed to correct resulting anemia and optimize coagulation parameters in severe cases. Refractory bleeding and severe bleeding leading to shock suggest the need for surgical resection of the involved bowel.

#### **Treatment of Relapse**

Relapse usually occurs within 2 weeks of the discontinuation of antibiotics. Isolates obtained after a relapse infection typically have the same antibiotic susceptibility as the isolate from the primary episode. Relapsed illness is usually mild compared with the primary episode. The approach to treating a relapsed infection is the same as treating a primary episode.

## **Treatment of Chronic Carriers**

Chronic carriage is asymptomatic and not associated with recurrence of illness. Although chronic carriage is associated with an increased risk of gallbladder carcinoma, no clear causal relationship is established, and it is unknown whether the eradication of carriage reduces this risk of carcinoma. The decision to attempt to eradicate carriage is based on public health considerations, and it is more difficult to eliminate carriage in patients with cholelithiasis. In some case series ciprofloxacin has demonstrated over 90% efficacy in the eradication of carriage; however, these studies predate the widespread emergence of fluoroquinolone resistance in *S.* Typhi in Asia[.38](#page-8-16) Cholecystectomy may be necessary to eradicate carriage in persons with cholelithiasis who fail medical therapy but for whom eradication is essential for public health reasons (e.g., food handlers).

#### **PREVENTION**

There are three licensed WHO pre-qualified vaccines for typhoid fever: Vi (capsular)-TT conjugate parenteral vaccines (TCV), Vi polysaccharide parenteral (ViPS) vaccine, and live attenuated Ty21a oral vaccine. The latter two vaccines are used primarily by travelers. Typhoid conjugate vaccines have been shown to induce long-term immune responses even in young children and are now WHO pre-qualified. In 2018 the WHO updated its position statement to endorse the use of typhoid vaccines in control programs, with TCV being the preferred vaccine. The WHO recommends the introduction of TCV to be prioritized in countries with the highest burden of typhoid fever or a high burden of antimicrobial resistance[.39](#page-8-17)

Other strategies to prevent *S.* Typhi and Paratyphi A include interventions to reduce exposure to food- and water-borne bacteria. On a household level, these include boiling and storing water in narrow-mouthed, covered containers. Food safety involves handwashing with soap before preparing or consuming foods and avoiding certain food types in endemic areas, such as raw foods and shellfish, and consuming only foods that are thoroughly cooked and hot at the time of consumption[.24](#page-8-1)
