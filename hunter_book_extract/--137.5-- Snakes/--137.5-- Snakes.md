#### KEY FEATURES

- • Venomous snakebites are largely an occupational/ environmental hazard of agricultural workers and their children in rural areas of the tropics. Most bites could be prevented by wearing protective footwear, by using lights while walking at night, and by sleeping off the ground or under a well-tucked-in mosquito net.
- • Snake venoms are rich in toxic proteins that cause necrosis, shock, hemostatic disturbances, paralysis, rhabdomyolysis, and acute kidney injury.
- • Bites by Elapidae (cobras, kraits, mambas, coral snakes, Australasian snakes, and sea snakes) may cause descending flaccid paralysis. Some elapid venoms cause local necrosis, rhabdomyolysis, and hemostatic disturbances.
- • Bites by Viperidae (vipers, adders, and pit vipers: rattlesnakes, moccasins, lanceheads) can cause severe local swelling, bruising, blistering, and necrosis together with shock, consumptive coagulopathy, spontaneous systemic bleeding, acute kidney injury, and, with some species, neurotoxicity.
- • First aid involves reassurance; immobilization of the whole patient, especially the bitten limb; rapid evacuation to the nearest hospital; and avoidance of dangerous traditional methods.
- • Specific antivenom is given if there is evidence of systemic or severe local envenoming. Assisted ventilation, renal dialysis, or cardiovascular support may be required.

## **INTRODUCTION**

The three families of venomous snakes—Lamprophiidae (Atractaspidinae), Elapidae, and Viperidae—contain some 500 species, whereas a fourth group, formerly a single family—the Colubridae but now comprising also the families Dipsadidae and Natricidae, contains at least 40 species that are venomous to humans. Fewer than 200 species have caused clinically severe envenoming ending in death or permanent disability.

## **DISTRIBUTION OF VENOMOUS SNAKES[1](#page-9-0)**

<span id="page-0-0"></span>Venomous species are widely distributed, except at altitudes above 5000 meters; in polar regions; and in most islands of the western Mediterranean, Atlantic, Caribbean, and Pacific. There are no venomous snakes in Madagascar, New Zealand, Ireland, Iceland, and Chile. The range of *Vipera berus* extends into the Arctic Circle. Sea snakes exist in the Indian and Pacific Oceans; in the Caribbean Sea; in a small area off the west coast of South Africa; and in estuaries, rivers (New Guinea), and lakes (Philippines, Cambodia, Solomon Islands).

## **SNAKE CLASSIFICATION**

Medically important snakes always possess one or more pairs of enlarged teeth in the upper jaw—the fangs—which penetrate the skin of their victim and conduct venom into the tissues along a groove or through a lumen.

## **Colubridae, Dipsadidae, and Natricidae (Back-Fanged Snakes)[2](#page-9-1)**

The fangs are relatively short, are situated at the posterior end of the maxilla, and are capable of only restricted movement [\(Fig.](#page-0-0) [137.5.1](#page-0-0)). African species—the boomslang *(Dispholidus typus),* and the vine, twig, tree, or bird snakes (*Thelotornis* spp.) of the family Colubridae—have killed a few people. The Japanese yamakagashi

*(Rhabdophis tigrinus,* family Natricidae) has caused coagulopathy and at least two deaths, whereas the related Southeast Asian rednecked keelback *(R. subminiatus)* has been responsible for cases of severe envenoming. Other snakes, such as South American racers (*Philodryas* spp., family Dipsadidae), can cause mild envenoming, but no deaths are reliably reported.

## **Atractaspidinae (Family Lamprophiidae) (Burrowing Asps)**

The African and Middle Eastern burrowing asps, also known as burrowing or mole vipers, adders, or stiletto snakes, have long front fangs and strike sideways. Three species are known to have caused fatal envenoming.

#### **Elapidae**

This family includes African and Asian cobras, Asian kraits, African mambas, American coral snakes, Australasian terrestrial venomous snakes, and all the sea snakes. The relatively short anterior fangs of these snakes are permanently erect and capable of little movement (Fig. [137.5.2\)](#page-1-0). In the ringhals and African and Asian spitting cobras, the venom channel opens forward before it reaches the tip of the fang, allowing venom to be ejected as a fine spray for a distance of several meters into the eyes of an aggressor.

## **Viperidae**

The fangs are situated anteriorly, are up to 2.5 cm in length, are curved, and are capable of a wide range of movement (Fig. [137.5.3](#page-1-1)). Pit vipers (subfamily Crotalinae) comprise rattlesnakes, moccasins, South American lance-headed vipers, and Asian pit vipers. They possess heat-sensitive pit organs behind their nostrils (Fig. [137.5.4](#page-1-2)). The Old World vipers, subfamily Viperinae, include the European, African, and Asian vipers and adders.

## **INCIDENCE AND IMPORTANCE OF SNAKEBIT[E3,4](#page-9-2)**

Global estimates of annual snakebite mortality vary from 20,000 to 138,000. Many survivors are left with persisting physical and psychological disabilities. Although it is an important medical emergency in some parts of the rural tropics, its incidence is usually underestimated because most victims seek the help of traditional healers rather than practitioners of Western-style medicine. In coastal Kenya, where snakebites cause 6.7 deaths per 100,000 per year(0.7%of all deaths),68%of bitten people firstsoughttreatment from traditional healers. In the Benue Valley of northeast Nigeria, *Echis ocellatus* causes some 500 bites per 100,000 population per year, with a 12% mortality. Well-designed studies of snakebite incidence have provided direct annual estimates of 46,000 deaths in India,[5](#page-9-3) 590,000 bites with 6000 deathsin Bangladesh, and 30,000 envenomings with 500 deaths in Sri Lanka.In Myanmar, Russell's viper bite is a common cause of acute kidney injury and is responsible

<span id="page-2-1"></span>\*Scientific (Latin) names are important because they are used internationally to describe the range of specificity of antivenoms. Specific antivenoms are manufactured for the treatment of envenoming by all these species (see [Table 137.5.2](#page-8-0) and source: World Health Organization. WHO guidelines for the production, control and regulation of snake antivenom immunoglobulins. 2nd edition 2018; [https://www.who.int/bloodproducts/snake\\_antivenoms/](https://www.who.int/bloodproducts/snake_antivenoms/snakeantivenomguide/en/) [snakeantivenomguide/en/.](https://www.who.int/bloodproducts/snake_antivenoms/snakeantivenomguide/en/)

for most of the estimated 1000 snakebite deaths each year. In Australia, among about 500 hospitalized cases/year, there are only 2 deaths, mainly attributable to brown snakes (*Pseudonaja* spp.). In the United States there are about 45,000 bites and a few deaths each year. Rattlesnakes, especially *Crotalus adamanteus, Cr. atrox, Cr. horridus, Cr. helleri, Cr. scutulatus, Cr. viridis,* and *Sistrurus miliaris*, are the most dangerous species. In Britain, the adder or viper (*Vipera berus*) is the only venomous species, biting more than 200 people each year. Only 14 deaths have been reported since 1876—with the last in 1975.Thisspeciesisimportant in Scandinavian countries.*Vipera aspis* causes most bites in France, whereas *Vipera ammodytes* is important in Eastern Europe.

Hunter-gatherer tribes, such as the Yanomamo (Venezuela), Waorani (Ecuador), Kaxinawa (Brazil), Hadza (Tanzania), and some tribal groups in Papua New Guinea, suffer high mortality from snakebites.

## **EPIDEMIOLOGY[3,4](#page-9-2)**

Most snakebites are inflicted on the lower limbs of farmers, plantation workers, herdsmen, hunters, and their families in rural areas of tropical developing countries. The incidence of bites by a particular species in a particular geographic area depends on the densities of human and snake populations, the snake's "irritability" (its inclination to bite when trodden on or disturbed) and diurnal rhythm, and the extent to which human activities encroach on its chosen habitat. The snake is usually trodden on at night or in undergrowth. Some species, such as the Asian kraits (*Bungarus* spp.), African spitting cobras (*Naja nigricollis, N. mossambica,* etc.), and Australian mulga snake (*Pseudechis australis*), enter human dwellings at night and may bite people who roll over onto them while sleeping on the floor. Snakes do not bite without provocation, but may strike if inadvertently trodden upon or touched. In Europe, North America, and Australia, exotic snakes are increasingly popular pets. In these countries, bites are inflicted on the hands of (usually) males who are picking up their pets, often late at night while drunk. In the United States 25% of bites result from snakes being attacked or handled by young men. Serious bites by back-fanged snakes usually occur only under these circumstances. Seasonal peaks in the incidence of snakebite are associated with agricultural activities, such as ploughing before the annual rains in the West African sahel and the rice harvest in Southeast Asia, or to fluctuations in the activity or population of venomous snakes. Severe flooding, by concentrating human and snake populations in diminishing areas of dry land, has given rise to epidemics of snakebite, notably in Colombia, Pakistan, India, Bangladesh, Nepal, Burma, and Vietnam. Invasion of virgin jungle during construction of new highways and irrigation and hydroelectric schemes has led to an increased incidence of snakebite in Brazil and Sri Lanka. On rare occasions, snakebite or injection of snake venom has been used for recreational purposes, suicide, or homicide.

#### **PREVENTION OF SNAKEBITE**

To reduce the risk of bites, snakes should never be disturbed, attacked, cornered, or handled—even if they are thought to be a harmless species or appear to be dead. Venomous species should not be kept as pets or as performing animals. In snake-infested areas, boots, socks, and long trousers should be worn for walks in undergrowth or deep sand, and a light and walking stick should always be carried at night. Collecting firewood; dislodging logs and boulders with bare hands; pushing sticks or fingers into burrows, holes, and crevices; climbing rocks and trees covered with dense foliage; and swimming in overgrown lakes and rivers are particularly hazardous activities. Unlit paths and gutters are especially dangerous after heavy rains. Sleeping on the ground carries a risk of nocturnal krait bites in South Asia and of spitting cobra bites in Africa, but well-tucked-in mosquito nets are protective. Attempting to exterminate venomous snakes has been tried unsuccessfully; it is futile and ecologically undesirable. Various substances toxic to snakes, such as insecticides and methylbromide, have been used to keep human dwellings free of these animals. However, no effective yet harmless snake repellent has been discovered.

#### **VENOM APPARATUS**

The venom glands, situated behind or below the eye, are surrounded by compressor muscles. The venom duct opens within a sheath at the base of the fang, and venom is conducted toward the tip in a partially or completely closed groove or fang canal. Venomous snakes can inject doses of venom lethal to their natural prey at each of 10 or more consecutive strikes. Whether the dose can be adjusted according to the size of the prey or the intention of the snake is controversial. The high proportion of bites without envenoming ("dry bites") reported for species such as *Calloselasma rhodostoma* (>50%) or *Pseudonaja* spp. (>80%) is more likely to reflect mechanical inefficiency than to voluntary control by the snake, and the concept of a defensive bite may not be valid. There is no support for the popular belief that snakes are less dangerous after they have eaten. The snake uses only a small fraction of the content of its venom gland at each strike.

The complexity and diversity of snake venoms are being revealed by the newer techniques employed in venomics (proteomics). More than 90% of the dry weight of venom is protein. Each venom may contain hundreds of different proteins. Enzymes (80%–90% of viperid; 25%–70% of elapid venoms) include digestive hydrolases, hyaluronidase, and activators or inactivators of many physiologic processes. Non-enzymatic polypeptide toxins and non-toxic proteins such as nerve growth factor are abundant. Viperid venoms have metalloproteinases, endopeptidase, arginine ester hydrolase, and kininogenase, as well as thrombin-like factor X and prothrombinactivating enzymes responsible for the anti-hemostatic effects of envenoming. Phospholipases A2 (lecithinases) are major constituents of most venoms. They damage mitochondria, erythrocytes, leukocytes, platelets, peripheral nerve endings, skeletal muscle, vascular endothelium, and other membranes and produce presynaptic paralysis, opiate-like sedative effects, and the autopharmacologic release of histamine. Some are anti-coagulant. Hyaluronidase promotes the spread of venom through tissues.

#### **Necrotoxins**

A variety of venom myotoxic and cytolytic factors contribute to local tissue necrosis at the site of the bite. Studies of terciopelo (*Bothrops asper*) venom–induced necrosis implicate zinc-dependent metalloproteinases and myotoxic phospholipases A2. In other cases, digestive hydrolases, hyaluronidase, polypeptide cytotoxins (Elapidae), and, perhaps, secondary effects of inflammation are involved.

#### **Neurotoxins**

Postsynaptic (α-)neurotoxins, such as α-bungarotoxin and cobrotoxin, are three-finger fold polypeptides that bind to acetylcholine receptors on the motor end plate. Like curare, they competitively inhibit acetylcholine. Presynaptic (β-)neurotoxins, such as β-bungarotoxin, crotoxin, taipoxin, and notexin, are phospholipases A2 that prevent release of acetylcholine at the neuromuscular junction and damage the nerve endings irreparably so that recovery will depend on the growth of new synapses. Myotoxic phospholipases A2 in venoms of Elapidae, notably sea snakes and some Australasian, American, and Asian terrestrial elapids, and Viperidae can cause generalized rhabdomyolysis.

## **Cardiovascular and Autopharmacologic Toxins**

Some venoms release vasodilating autacoids such as histamine and kinins. Venom of the Brazilian jararaca (*Bothrops jararaca*) and other vipers contain bradykinin-potentiating and angiotensinconverting enzyme (ACE)–inhibiting peptides that cause hypotension. Sarafotoxins from the venom of the Israeli burrowing asp (*Atractaspis engaddensis*) are similar to physiologic endothelins. They are potent vasoconstrictors of the coronary arteries and delay atrioventricular conduction.

## **Variation in Venom Composition**

Venom composition varies enormously from species to species but also within a single species throughout its geographic range, at different seasons of the year, and ontogenically as the snake matures.

#### **Pharmacology**

When snakes bite people, venom is inoculated subcutaneously or intramuscularly. Intravenous injection is a remote possibility. Smaller Mw elapid neurotoxins are rapidly absorbed into the bloodstream, whereas larger Mw phospholipase A2 presynaptic toxins and viperid enzymes are taken up more slowly through the lymphatics, sometimes causing visible lymphangitis and enlarged, painful lymph nodes. Continuing absorption of venom from the depot injected at the site of the bite may explain delayed or recurrent envenoming after an initial therapeutic response to antivenom. Redistribution of venom toxins into the vascular compartment may occur as a result of antivenom treatment. Envenoming after ingestion of snake venom has not been reported in people. Most venoms are concentrated and bound in the kidney, and some components are eliminated in the urine. Crotaline venoms are selectively bound in the lungs, concentrated in the liver, and excreted in bile, whereas polypeptide neurotoxins, such as α-bungarotoxin, are tightly bound at neuromuscular junctions. Most venom components do not cross the intact blood–brain barrier. Central nervous system effects of venoms, such as drowsiness, remain controversial.

## **CLINICAL EFFECT[S3,4,7,8](#page-9-2)**

The patient who has been bitten by a snake may present with symptoms resulting from fear, from pre-hospital treatment, and from effects of the venom itself. Snakebite is usually a terrifying experience, especially for those who believe that all bites are rapidly fatal. Physiologic manifestations of anxiety may confuse the clinical picture. Thus patients who are bitten but not envenomed may feel flushed and breathless, with constriction of the chest and a thumping pulse, palpitations, sweating, and effects of hyperventilation, such as dizziness, syncope, acroparesthesia, and carpo-pedal spasms. Such symptoms dominate many accounts of snakebites written by the victims and are falsely attributed to neurotoxicity. Misguided traditional pre-hospital treatments can result in swelling and ischemia of limbs whose circulation is occluded by tourniquets, bleeding or sensory loss resulting from local incisions, vomiting and other side effects caused by ingested herbal remedies, smarting eyes and conjunctivitis from instillation of plant juices, and bronchospasm from insufflation of oils. Rarely, snakebite may precipitate vasovagal collapse, angina pectoris, myocardial infarction, or cardiac arrhythmia.

#### **General Symptoms and Signs**

The evolution of symptoms and signs of envenoming depends on the nature of the venom, the dose, and the site of injection. The earliest symptom is usually pain—felt immediately, but krait and sea snake bites may be painless. Local swelling may start within

minutes, and consumption coagulopathy with undetectable plasma concentrations of fibrinogen and other clotting factors can develop in half an hour (*Calloselasma rhodostoma* and *Echis* species). Rarely, death may occur as soon as 15 minutes after an elapid (e.g., *Naja naja* or *Dendroaspis* species) or viper (e.g., *Daboia russelii, D. siamensis*) bite. Usually, however, death comes hours after an elapid bite and days after a viper bite.

#### **Local Effects**

These are particularly characteristic of bites by the Viperidae, including pit vipers (subfamily Crotalinae), African spitting cobras (e.g., *Naja mossambica, N. nigricollis*), and Asian cobras (e.g., *N. naja, Naja kaouthia,* and *Naja siamensis*). Tender swelling spreads from the site of the bite, and there is early painful enlargement of lymph nodes draining the bitten area. Within a few hours, blood- or fluid-filled bullae may appear under the epidermis [\(Fig.](#page-4-0) [137.5.5](#page-4-0)). With elapid bites, blistering is nearly always followed by tissue necrosis, usually superficial, which may extend up the fascial planes of the limb, sometimes as "skip lesions" separated by areas of apparently unaffected skin (Fig. [137.5.6\)](#page-4-1). Bullae caused by Viperidae bites frequently dry up and slough without the development of necrosis. A pale, anesthetic, demarcated area of skin smelling of putrefaction signals the appearance of necrosis. Necrotic tissue is vulnerable to secondary infection by bacteria, including *Clostridium tetani* and other anaerobes.

Massive swelling of the bitten limb and adjacent areas of the trunk indicates increased permeability leading to extravasation of circulating volume; a swollen limb can accommodate several liters of blood/plasma. The result may be hypovolemia causing postural hypotension. Envenoming by rattlesnakes (*Crotalus*) produces local pain with swelling that appears within 15 minutes of the bite and may spread rapidly. Bruising along the path of lymphatics and bullae and local necrosis may develop. Peri-oral and labial paresthesias and an abnormal metallic taste are common early symptoms after bites by Southern Pacific (*Cr. helleri*), Eastern diamondback

(*Cr. adamanteus*), Western diamondback (*Cr. atrox*), and timber (*Cr. horridus*) rattlesnakes. Other symptoms include weakness, rigors, sweating, spontaneous bleeding, neurotoxic effects such as fasciculations or myokymia (*Cr. adamanteus, Cr. scutulatus*), and gastrointestinal symptoms. Bites by Mojave rattlesnakes (*Cr. scutulatus*) and *Cr. durissus terrificus* may produce little or no local envenoming other than erythema, but severe systemic signs.

#### **Bleeding and Clotting Disturbances**

This combination is characteristic of vipers, pit vipers, and some Australasian/Oceanian elapids. Spontaneous bleeding is most frequently detected in the gingival sulci (Fig. [137.5.7\)](#page-4-2). The most common sites of hemorrhage are intracerebral, gastrointestinal, retroperitoneal, and genito-urinary, including uterine bleeding in pregnant women. Oozing from sites of venipunctures or other recent trauma suggests that the blood is uncoagulable. Hemorrhagic and thrombotic (ischemic) strokes are an important cause of death and morbidity.

#### **Hypotension and Shock**

Early syncope can occur as part of the autopharmacologic syndrome after bites by vipers, Australasian elapids, and burrowing asps. Shock is most commonly the result of hypovolemia (Fig. [137.5.8](#page-5-0)), vasodilatation, or direct action of venom on the myocardium.

#### **Neurotoxicity**

This is a feature of envenoming by elapids. A few species of vipers also produce neurotoxic effects, for example, South American *Cr. durissus terrificus,* Chinese *Gloydius brevicaudus,* Southern African *Bitis atropos,* and South Asian *Daboia russelii.* Typically, neurotoxic symptoms develop early, but after krait and coral snakebites there may be a delay of 10 or more hours. Symptoms include vomiting, headache, paresthesia, hyperacusis, diplopia, blurred vision, heaviness of the eyelids, and difficulty in speaking. The levator palpebrae superioris and extraocular muscles are the most sensitive to neuromuscular blockade, and in some patients, the only feature of envenoming is bilateral ptosis and ophthalmoplegia. More serious effects are paralysis of the palate, jaws, tongue, vocal cords, neck muscles, and muscles of deglutition and respiration (Fig. [137.5.9](#page-5-1)). The intercostal muscles are affected before the diaphragm and limbs. Paralyzed patients are fully conscious unless they are hypoxemic (respiratory failure) or hypotensive (circulatory failure).

Note bilateral ptosis (the patient is attempting to open his eyes by contracting the frontalis muscle) and inability to breathe spontaneously (mechanical intubation via endotracheal tube) (© David A. Warrell).

<span id="page-5-1"></span>Neurotoxicity is usually completely reversible; in some cases there is a rapid response to specific antivenom or anti-cholinesterase, and in others there is slow, spontaneous resolution. Without specific antivenom, patients supported by artificial ventilation recover sufficient diaphragmatic movement to breathe adequately in 1 to 4 days. The ocular muscles recover in 2 to 4 days, and there is usually full recovery of motor function in 3 to 7 days. Upper airway obstruction by the tongue or inhaled vomitus may precipitate respiratory arrest.

#### <span id="page-5-2"></span>**Generalized Rhabdomyolysis**

Envenoming by sea snakes[,9](#page-9-5) some Australasian elapids, *Daboia russelii,* and *Cr. durissus terrificus* can cause generalized rhabdomyolysis. The symptoms are muscle pain and stiffness with trismus and respiratory muscle paralysis. Myoglobinemia, myoglobinuria, hyperkalemia, and acute kidney injury (AKI) may result.

#### **Acute Kidney Injury**

This can complicate almost any severe case of snakebite, but it is the major cause of death in victims of sea snakes, some Australasian elapids, Russell's vipers, some *Bothrops* spp., and *Cr. durissus terrificus.* Mechanisms of renal damage include ischemia (from hypotension, renal vasoconstriction, or disseminated intravascular coagulation) (Fig. [137.5.10](#page-5-2)), hemorrhage, direct nephrotoxicity, or pigment nephropathy associated with massive intravascular hemolysis, microangiopathic hemolysis, generalized rhabdomyolysis, and associated electrolyte disturbances.

## **Venom Ophthalmia Caused by Spitting Cobra[s10](#page-10-0)**

The ringhals *(Hemachatus haemachatus)* and African and Asian spitting cobras can eject venom in a fine stream from the tips of their fangs for a distance of a few meters. If venom enters the eye, there is intense local pain, leukorrhea, blepharospasm, and palpebral edema. Slit lamp examination or fluorescein staining reveals corneal erosions in more than half of the cases of *Naja nigricollis* ophthalmia in West Africa. There is a risk of secondary infection, as with other corneal injuries (Fig. [137.5.11](#page-6-0)), leading to permanent blindness in some cases. The venom may be absorbed also into the anterior chamber, resulting in anterior uveitis with hypopyon.

#### **LABORATORY INVESTIGATIONS**

There is a peripheral neutrophil leukocytosis in patients with severe envenoming, evidence of a systemic inflammatory response. Anemia is the result of bleeding or intravascular and microangiopathic hemolysis. Thrombocytopenia occurs with disseminated intravascular coagulation, together with a hemolytic uremic-like syndrome in victims of some viper and Australian elapid envenomings. An important simple test for venom-induced defibrination is the 20-minute whole blood clotting test. A few milliliters of blood are placed in a new, clean, dry glass test tube, left undisturbed

<span id="page-6-1"></span>for 20 minutes, and then tipped once to check for clotting [\(Fig.](#page-6-1) [137.5.12\)](#page-6-1). If the tube is not made of proper glass or has been cleaned with detergent, its wall may not activate clotting via Hageman factor (FXII), causing a false-positive result. Rising serum creatinine, blood urea and potassium concentrations indicate AKI. Serum enzymes, such as aspartate and alanine aminotransferases and creatine kinase, are mildly elevated in patients with local tissue damage but are grossly raised if there is generalized rhabdomyolysis. The urine of snakebite victims commonly contains red and white blood cells and granular casts. Dark urine should be tested for hemoglobin and myoglobin. Electrocardiographic changes, such as inverted T waves, raised ST segments, prolonged Q-Tc intervals, and arrhythmias, have been reported. Imaging and ultrasound are useful for diagnosis of pulmonary edema, myocardial dysfunction, and hemorrhagic or thrombotic infarctions in different organs.

## **VENOM IMMUNODIAGNOSIS**

Specific snake venom antigens have been detected in wound swabs, aspirates or biopsies, serum, urine, cerebrospinal fluid, and other body fluids. Enzyme immunoassay (EIA) has been the most widely used. Under ideal conditions, relatively high venom antigen concentrations (wound swabs or aspirates) may be detected quickly enough (15–30 minutes) to allow the selection of the appropriate monospecific antivenom. A commercial venom detection kit for Australian elapids is produced by Seqirus (Melbourne, Australia). For retrospective diagnosis, including forensic cases, tissue around the fang punctures, wound and blister aspirate, serum, and urine should be stored for EIA immunodiagnosis.

# **TREATMENT OF SNAKEBIT[E3,4,7–13](#page-9-2)**

Management starts with first aid by the snakebite victim or whoever happens to be present when the bite occurs. First aid principles are a priority for community health education in schools, at clinics, and via the media.

## **First-Aid Treatment**

Most snakebite victims are terrified and require reassurance. The bitten limb should be immobilized, if possible, with a splint or sling and the patient quickly moved to the nearest treatment facility. Pain can be treated with oral acetaminophen or codeine phosphate. Aspirin and non-steroidal anti-inflammatory agents should be avoided, if possible, as they may lead to persistent gastric bleeding in patients with uncoagulable blood. Local incisions and suction are more likely to introduce infection and cause persistent bleeding than to remove significant amounts of venom from the wound. In one study of viper bites in Jammu, India, 94% of patients who had received incisions developed local infection, compared with none in the group without incisions. Vacuum extractors, potassium permanganate instillation, and ice packs can increase local necrosis. Electric shock treatment is potentially dangerous and of unproven value.

#### **Tourniquets**

Tight (arterial-occlusive) tourniquets must never be recommended for snakebite first aid because they have been responsible for gangrenous limbs, peripheral nerve damage, and other harmful effects.

## **Pressure-Pad Immobilization and Pressure-Bandage Immobilization**

Delaying the onset of potentially fatal respiratory paralysis or shock before the patient reaches medical care by hindering the spread of venom toxins from the bite site is a priority. Tight arterial tourniquets are too dangerous to be recommended, but in animal studies, compressing superficial veins and lymphatics in the bitten limb at about 55 mmHg reduces the spread of larger Mw toxins such as the presynaptic phospholipase A2 toxins of Australian elapid venoms. Two acceptably safe and promising first-aid methods are currently available that might achieve this, but both require further clinical testing.

**Pressure-pad immobilization (Monash method):** A pad of any kind of folded cloth, bandage, or foam rubber, approximately 6 × 6 × 3 cm is applied tightly (≈70 mmHg pressure) directly over the bite site, using an inelastic bandage. The bitten limb is then splinted to minimize movement. A field study of Russell's viper victims in Myanmar confirmed that this method prevented leakage of venom into the systemic circulation.

**Pressure-bandage immobilization (Sutherland method):** The entire bitten limb is bound "as tightly as for a sprained ankle," using a series of 10-cm-wide elasticated bandages, starting distal to the bite site, at the toes or fingers, and finishing in the groin or axilla. An immobilizing splint is incorporated. Anecdotal experience supports the use of this method, but it is demanding in terms of equipment and has proved difficult to teach/learn.

## **Transport to Medical Care**

Patients should be transported to a hospital as quickly, but as passively, as possible. They should be placed on their left side in the recovery position to prevent aspiration of vomit. Syncope, shock, angioedema, and other anaphylactic symptoms can be treated with 0.1% epinephrine by intramuscular injection (0.5 ml for adults, 0.01 ml/kg for children) and an antihistamine such as chlorphenamine maleate, by IV injection (10 mg for adults, 0.2 mg/kg for children). Respiratory distress and cyanosis should be treated by clearing the airway; preventing obstruction by the tongue by jaw-lifting, inserting an oropharyngeal airway, and positioning; giving oxygen; and, if necessary, assisted ventilation. If the patient is unconscious and no femoral or carotid pulses can be detected, cardiopulmonary resuscitation must be started immediately.

If the snake has been killed, it should be brought to the hospital for identification, but it must be handled cautiously, as even snakes that appear dead and severed heads can cause envenoming. They should be carried on a stick or maneuvered into a container.

## **Treatment by Medically Trained Personnel in a Hospital or Dispensary**

Because of the uncertainties about the type, quantity, and quality of venom injected and the variable time course for development of signs of envenoming, all victims of snakebite should be hospitalized and observed for at least 24 hours. Frequent observations of the level of consciousness, blood pressure, and pulse and respiratory rate, and new signs, such as ptosis, should be made. Any ligatures should be released, preferably after starting administration of antivenom (see ["Antivenom Treatment"](#page-7-0) later). Physical examination should include assessment of local swelling, tender enlargement of regional lymph nodes draining the bitten area, spontaneous bleeding (most often detected in the gingival sulci [see Fig. [137.5.7\]](#page-4-2), nose and gastrointestinal and genitourinary tracts), blood pressure, ptosis (the earliest sign of neurotoxic envenoming [see Fig. [137.5.9\]](#page-5-1)), and assessment of respiratory muscle power. If a coagulopathic venom is suspected, hemostasis should be checked at the bedside by the 20-minute whole blood clotting test or by rapid laboratory tests of hemostasis.

#### <span id="page-7-0"></span>**Antivenom Treatment**

Antivenom (also known as *antivenin, antivenene,* and *anti-snakebite serum*) is the only specific antidote for envenoming. It is the partially purified immunoglobulin (whole immunoglobulin G [IgG], F(ab′)2, or Fab fragments) of horses or sheep that have been hyperimmunized with venoms of one species of snake (monovalent) or several species (polyvalent) of greatest medical importance in a particular region[.14](#page-10-1)

#### Indications

Because of their high cost and danger of reactions, antivenoms should not be used indiscriminately. Antivenom is indicated if there is evidence of either systemic envenoming (hypotension or other signs of cardiovascular toxicity, neurotoxicity, generalized rhabdomyolysis, spontaneous systemic bleeding, uncoagulable blood, peripheral leukocytosis of more than 20 × 109 /L, elevated serum enzymes, hemoglobinuria, myoglobinuria, severe anemia or hemoconcentration, increasing serum creatinine and blood urea and oliguria) or of severe or rapidly progressive local envenoming with swelling involving more than half of the bitten limb or bites on fingers or toes, especially by species known to cause necrosis.

#### Contraindications

Because of the danger of severe reactions, atopic individuals and those known to be hypersensitive to equine (or ovine) serum should be pre-treated with epinephrine, hydrocortisone, and antihistamine (see the earlier section for doses) and watched carefully for at least 2 hours after completion of antivenom administration.

#### Administration

Antivenom should be given as soon as it is indicated. It remains effective as long as signs of systemic envenoming persist (7 days or more after the bite in the case of patients with viperid bite coagulopathy). However, to prevent or restrict local envenoming, antivenom must be given early, within a few hours of envenoming. Only specific antivenom—one whose range of specificity includes the biting species—should be used. Some antivenoms raised against the venom of one or more species have paraspecific activity against venoms of related species. Antivenom should be diluted in an appropriate volume of fluid and given by "push" injection over 10 to 15 minutes or by intravenous (IV) infusion over 30 to 60 minutes. Epinephrine must be ready to be given in case of early anaphylactic reactions during the infusion. The patient must be watched carefully while antivenom is being given and for at least 2 hours afterward. At the first sign of a reaction, administration of antivenom should be stopped and epinephrine given. Once the symptoms of the reaction have subsided, antivenom infusion can be completed. An anti-H1 histamine blocker (such as IV chlorphenamine maleate, 10 mg in adults, 0.2 mg/kg in children) is given to combat released histamine. Antivenom reactions are not predicted by conjunctival or intradermal "hypersensitivity tests," which can only detect specific IgE. Anti-H1 histamine blockers and corticosteroids have proved ineffective, singly or in combination, in preventing early anaphylactic antivenom reactions, but epinephrine (adult dose 0.25 ml of 0.1% solution), administered subcutaneously before antivenom is given, reduces the frequency and severity of early anaphylactic reactions.[15](#page-10-2) The initial dose of antivenom has been established for some antivenoms ([Table](#page-8-0) [137.5.2](#page-8-0)). It should be increased in severely envenomed patients. The same dose of antivenom is used for children and adults.

#### Response to Antivenom

Spontaneous systemic bleeding usually stops within about 30 minutes of starting antivenom, and blood coagulability is usually restored within 6 hours if an adequate neutralizing dose of antivenom has been given. Improvement in neurotoxic symptoms attributable to postsynaptic toxins (e.g., Australian and Papuan death adder [genus *Acanthophis*] andAsian cobras [genus *Naja*]) may be observed within 30 to 60 minutes. However, severe local envenoming, nephrotoxicity after Russell's viper bites, and presynaptic neurotoxicity are not reversed by antivenom. Further antivenom should be given if severe signs of envenoming persist after 1 to 2 hours or if blood coagulability is not restored within about 6 hours.

#### **Adverse Antivenom Reactions**

Early anaphylactic reactions usually develop within 10 to 60 minutes of starting IV administration of antivenom. Premonitory symptoms

include restlessness, cough, itching of the scalp, nausea, vomiting, a feeling of heat, or an increase in pulse rate followed by generalized pruritus and appearance of urticaria, fever, tachycardia, autonomic manifestations, and, in a few patients, severe hypotension, airflow obstruction, and angioedema. The incidence of early reactions is dose dependent and also depends on the quality of manufacture. In most cases, complement activation by IgG, F(ab′)2 or Fab aggregates or residual Fc fragments is thought to be the mechanism, rather than IgE-mediated type I hypersensitivity to equine or ovine serum, which is rare. Pyrogenic reactions occur within 1 to 2 hours of antivenom treatment and can precipitate febrile convulsions in children. They are attributable to endotoxin contamination during manufacture[.14](#page-10-1) Late reactions of serum sickness may develop 5 to 10 days after antivenom treatment. They are dose related. Clinical features include fever, pruritus, urticaria, subcutaneous and periarticular swellings, polyarthritis, lymphadenopathy, mononeuritis multiplex and other neurologic symptoms, and proteinuria.

## **Supportive Treatment**

#### Neurotoxic Envenoming

Patients with bulbar paralysis cannot protect their airway and may aspirate secretions or vomitus, causing airway obstruction or pneumonia. Others die of respiratory muscle paralysis. Supra-glottal or endotracheal intubation should be performed when secretions start to pool in the pharynx, before obstruction or respiratory arrest has developed. If respiratory muscle power is inadequate, ventilation must be assisted. Patients have recovered from respiratory paralysis after being manually ventilated with Ambu bag by relays of relatives or nurses for up to 30 days and after mechanical ventilation for up to 10 weeks. Neurotoxic envenoming should be fully reversible, and so assisted ventilation should always be attempted. Anticholinesterases have a variable, but potentially useful, effect in patients with neurotoxic envenoming, especially when postsynaptic neurotoxins are involved. The "Tensilon test" can be performed, as with suspected myasthenia gravis. Atropine sulfate (0.6 mg for adults; 50 µg/kg for children) or glycopyrronium is given by IV injection followed by edrophonium chloride (Tensilon) by slow IV injection in an adult dose of 10 mg (0.25 mg/ kg for children) or neostigmine bromide or methylsulphate (Prostigmin) by intramuscular injection 0.02 mg/kg for adults (0.04 mg/kg for children). Patients with objective evidence of response can be maintained on neostigmine methylsulphate, 0.5 to 2.5 mg every 1 to 3 hours up to 10 mg/24 hours maximum for adults or 0.01 to 0.04 mg/kg every 2 to 4 hours for children by intramuscular, IV, or subcutaneous injection.[16](#page-10-3)

#### Circulatory Collapse (Shock)

Antivenom should be given, as well as plasma expanders. Clinical observation of jugular venous pressure or measurement of central venous pressure or pulmonary wedge pressure (via a Swan–Ganz catheter) helps prevent fluid overload and precipitation of pulmonary edema. If hypotension persists despite restoration of central venous pressure to +10 to 15 cm H2O, a vasopressor drug should be infused (e.g., dopamine, initial dose 2 µg/kg/min through the central catheter).

#### Local Necrosis

Once definite signs of necrosis have appeared, surgical debridement is required, with antibiotic prophylaxis to cover anaerobic organisms.

#### Intracompartmental Syndrome and Fasciotomy

Increased pressure within tight fascial compartments, such as the digital pulp spaces and anterior tibial compartment, may cause ischemia. Necrosis of digits is especially common. The signs are excessive pain, weakness, and tenderness of the compartmental muscles and pain when they are passively stretched; hypoesthesia of skin supplied by nerves running through the compartment; and obvious tenseness of the compartment. Detection of arterial pulses by palpation or Doppler does not exclude intracompartmental ischemia. Sustained intracompartmental pressures exceeding 45 mmHg are associated with a risk of ischemic necrosis. In these circumstances, fasciotomy may be justified, but it did not prove effective in saving envenomed muscle in experimental animals. Fasciotomy is contraindicated until blood coagulability has been restored (by adequate doses of antivenom, if necessary followed by clotting factors) and must be justified by demonstration that the intracompartmental pressure is consistently raised to less than 30 mmHg below mean arterial pressure. Early adequate antivenom treatment will prevent the development of intracompartmental syndromes in most cases.

#### **Local Infection at the Site of the Bite**

Local infections may result from unusual bacteria derived from the snake's venom or fangs or contamination of the wound from non-sterile incisions. A booster dose of tetanus toxoid should be given, but prophylactic antibiotics are not indicated unless the wound has been incised or tampered with in any way. If the wound is necrotic, *Clostridium tetani* should be eliminated with a large dose of benzyl penicillin or metronidazole and an aminoglycoside, such as gentamicin, given for 48 hours. If a local abscess develops, it should be drained and the patient given a course of antibiotics.

#### **Acute Kidney Injury**

Some snakebite victims admitted with oliguria and elevated blood urea nitrogen and creatinine levels are simply hypovolemic. Urine output, serum creatinine, urea, and electrolytes should be measured each day in patients with severe envenoming and in those bitten by species known to cause AKI. If urine output drops below 400 mL in 24 hours, urethral and central venous catheters should be inserted. If urine flow fails to increase after cautious rehydration, the patient should be placed on strict fluid balance. Diuretics and dopamine are no longer recommended. Renal replacement therapy is often required.

#### **Other Drugs**

Heparin, anti-fibrinolytic agents (aprotinin, ε-aminocaproic acid), corticosteroids, antihistamines, and a variety of herbal and other remedies have been advocated for treatment of snakebite. None has proved effective, and many are harmful.

## **Treatment of Snake Venom Ophthalmia[7](#page-9-6)**

When cobra venom is "spat" into the eyes, first aid consists of irrigation with generous volumes of water or any other bland liquid such as milk—or even urine—which may be available. Unless a corneal abrasion can be excluded by fluorescein staining or slit-lamp examination, treatment should be the same as for any corneal injury; a topical antimicrobial such as tetracycline or chloramphenicol should be applied. Instillation of antivenom is not recommended. Local anesthetic eye drops or epinephrine (0.1%) drops relieve the intense pain but should only be used once, after which the cornea must be protected.
