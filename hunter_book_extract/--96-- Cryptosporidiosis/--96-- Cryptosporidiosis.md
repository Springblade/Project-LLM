# **96** Cryptosporidiosis

*Lihua Xiao, Jeffrey K. Griffiths*

# KEY FEATURES

- • Cryptosporidiosis is an intestinal infection caused by intracellular protozoan *Cryptosporidium* species.
- • Cryptosporidiosis is a cosmopolitan cause of acute and chronic diarrhea, clinically indistinguishable from many other enteric pathogens, and one of the leading causes of diarrhea globally.
- • Specific diagnosis requires additional laboratory testing of stool specimens, such as acid-fast staining, compared with other parasites.
- • Cryptosporidiosis is a common intestinal infection in AIDS patients causing malabsorption and chronic diarrhea; it can infect the biliary system and respiratory tract. Resolution of the infection requires intact cell-mediated immunity, which in persons with HIV/ AIDS often means that highly active antiretroviral therapy (HAART) must be initiated.
- • Cryptosporidiosis is a frequent cause of mortality in persons with AIDS and sometimes malnutrition or other forms of immunosuppression, with death from wasting or dehydration. Testing for this parasite should always be considered in immunocompromised people with diarrhea.
- • Most human disease is caused by the human-adapted species *Cryptosporidium hominis,* but substantial disease is caused by zoonotic *C. parvum* (often found in young cattle and other herbivores) and occasionally parasite species adapted to other mammals and birds.
- • No highly effective therapy exists, and the form of the parasite involved in transmission is highly resistant to water chlorination. Nitazoxanide is modestly effective in immunocompetent persons. Thus the prevention of infection is critical, especially for persons with HIV/ AIDS.
- • *Cryptosporidium* can be killed by heating contaminated food or water. Filtering and boiling render drinking water safe for consumption.

### **INTRODUCTION**

Human cryptosporidiosis was first reported in 1976. It is a classic diarrheal "emerging disease" because it has a very low infectious dose, is most severe in immunocompromised populations, is highly resistant to anti-parasitic therapy, has human and non-human reservoirs, and can cause major epidemics when public health measures break down. Cryptosporidiosis is most common in developing countries but remains a significant pathogen of children and the elderly in industrialized nations, with water-borne, foodborne, person-to-person, and zoonotic transmission pathways.[1,2](#page-6-0) It is a common cause of wasting and lethal diarrhea in HIV-infected persons and acute and persistent diarrhea in children.

#### **EPIDEMIOLOGY**

*Cryptosporidium* spp. are among the most common diarrheal pathogens worldwide[.5](#page-6-1) In developing countries ≈20% of diarrheic children have cryptosporidiosis[,3,4](#page-6-2) contrasting with 1% to 5% in North America and Europe. The importance of this infection was illustrated by landmark studies conducted in the 1990s in West Africa which showed that children with a clinical episode of cryptosporidiosis subsequently suffered higher rates of death, with an excess mortality 2.9-fold higher even after correction for nutritional factors.[6](#page-6-3) Infection usually occurs before 2 years in the forme[r3,4,7](#page-6-2) and before 5 years in the latter[.8–10](#page-6-4) Prevalence is higher in rural areas[4,8](#page-6-5) and during rainy seasons[3,4,7;](#page-6-2) seropositivity increases with age, suggesting continued exposure. Malnutritio[n3,7](#page-6-2) HIV/ AIDS,[11](#page-6-6) and other immunocompromising conditions significantly increase the risk, severity, and persistence of cryptosporidiosis. It is an AIDS-defining opportunistic infection and frequently afflicts malnourished children with persistent diarrhea. Cryptosporidiosisaffected children may have impaired growth and cognitive functio[n2](#page-6-7) and have multiple symptomatic episodes before they acquire partial protective immunity.[12](#page-6-8)

Water, residential surfaces, and food may be contaminated by *Cryptosporidium-*containing feces and serve as sources of infection, as well as person-to-person transmission where hygienic standards are low[.12,13](#page-6-8) In industrialized countries transmission is less frequent, likely because of public health interventions relating to clean food, water treatment, and sanitation. Transmission has also been linked to international travel, contact with animals or children with diarrhea, recreational water exposure, and multiple sexual partners or anal intercourse.[9,11–14](#page-6-9)

### **NATURAL HISTORY, PATHOGENESIS, AND PATHOLOGY**

Replication of *Cryptosporidium* only occurs in the gastrointestinal tract of vertebrates (fish, amphibians, reptiles, birds, and mammals). The incubation period ranges from 4 to 10 days after oocyst ingestion [\(Fig. 96.1\)](#page-1-0).[2,15](#page-6-7) Excretion of infectious oocysts in feces begins approximately when symptoms begin and may persist for months. The infectious dose is low (10–1000 oocysts); in animal models a single oocyst can cause infection. Unlike many other coccidian parasites, the oocysts of *Cryptosporium* spp. are immediately infectious when they are passed in stool. Internal autoinfection is common and likely to be responsible for the chronic nature of the disease in immunocompromised people. *C. hominis* and *C. parvum* cause ≈75% and 20% of human disease, respectively.[13,16](#page-6-10) *C. hominis* is more virulent in humans than other species and only infects humans, whereas *C. parvum* infects many ruminants, such as cattle and sheep (see [Fig. 96.1\)](#page-1-0).[16](#page-6-11) *C. meleagridis,* an avian species, is the third most commonly identified human pathogen.

The natural history is quite variable ([Table 96.1\)](#page-2-0). Transient infection may be asymptomatic or symptomatic with diarrhea, which is most severe in young children. Asymptomatic infections are seen after prior symptomatic infections. Disease resolution depends on intact cell-mediated immunity, and the antibody response appears to be nearly irrelevant[.17](#page-6-12) Persistent infection can also be relatively asymptomatic or quite severe with malabsorption and weight loss. A cholera-like, severely dehydrating, rapidly fatal syndrome in persons with AIDS has been described. Persons with

Sporulated oocysts are excreted by the infected host through feces (1). Transmission of *C. parvum* and *C. hominis* occurs mainly through contact with contaminated water (e.g., drinking or recreational water), food, and infected persons (for *C. hominis* and *C. parvum*) or animals (for *C. parvum* only). Zoonotic and anthroponotic transmission of *C. parvum* and anthroponotic transmission of *C. hominis* occur through exposure to infected individuals or water, food, and fomites contaminated by feces of infected animals/persons (2). Humans (for *C. hominis* and *C. parvum*) and animals (for *C. parvum*) become infected after ingestion (and possibly inhalation) of oocysts (3). Sporozoites released by oocysts go through several rounds of multiplications in the small intestine and colon, and sporulated oocysts are generated and excreted by infected persons or animals. Oocysts are infective upon excretion, thus permitting direct and immediate fecal–oral transmission.

<span id="page-2-4"></span>this manifestation usually die within 2 weeks of symptom onset unless aggressively hydrated and provided with nutritional support, while anti-HIV medications are also given to reverse immunosuppression. Although persistent infection occurs in persons with inflammatory bowel disease, immunosuppression, or renal disease, the greatest burden is in pediatric-persistent diarrhea and in persons with HIV/AIDS.

*Cryptosporidium* parasites infect the colonic mucosa and, less commonly, the small intestine and stomach. Replicating parasites may, however, infect the entire gut from oropharynx to anus. Histologically, mononuclear cell infiltration in the lamina propria, mucosal cell apoptosis and mucosal inflammation with villus blunting, and cryptitis are seen, which can lead to a loss of barrier function and malabsorption [\(Fig. 96.2\)](#page-2-4). Illness severity correlates with the extent of infection and host immunity. In persons with HIV, infection of the crypts suggests more severe disease, as does infection of the proximal small bowel with villus flattening.[2,17–20](#page-6-7) Diarrhea with chloride secretion and impaired glucose absorption is mediated by substance P, a gastrointestinal tract neuropeptide[.21](#page-6-16)

This parasite [\(Fig. 96.3](#page-3-0)) uniquely occupies an intracellular but extracytoplasmic site. This may account for its resistance to therapeutic drugs that are effective against similar parasites (such as malaria, *Toxoplasma,* or *Babesia*), which are intracellular but intracytoplasmic. It has been theorized that drugs that enter the

Immune competence is an important determinant in the severity and duration of intestinal disease in humans. Cryptosporidiosis is a self-limiting illness of 7 to 14 days' duration in immunocompetent individuals, but it can be a life-threatening illness in the severely immunocompromised (such as people with AIDS), hypogammaglobulinemia, or those receiving immunosuppressive drugs for cancer or to prevent rejection in transplantation. Persons with HIV with CD4 cell counts >180 per µL tend to resolve their infections[.22](#page-6-17)

# **CLINICAL FEATURES**

Enteric cryptosporidiosis has no unique clinical signs or symptoms, and it resembles many other forms of diarrheal disease. First infections are usually symptomatic with watery diarrhea, vomiting, nausea, abdominal cramps, and fatigue. Blood or leukocytes are rarely seen in stool specimens. Both low-grade fever and cough are more frequently found than in most other enteric infections. In developing countries where repeated exposure is common, most infected children are asymptomatic. Those with symptoms are generally sick for less than 7 days (median of 2 days). Weight loss and dehydration are common. Cryptosporidiosis is more common in malnourished children and those with persistent diarrhea. Both asymptomatic and symptomatic cryptosporidiosis appear to cause malnutrition, stunted growth, and impaired cognitive function[.2](#page-6-7) Immunocompetent persons with cryptosporidiosis in industrialized nations usually have clinical symptoms of explosive, watery diarrhea[,14,23,24](#page-6-18) which may last for a median of 9 to 11 days. Hospitalization may occur in 7% to 22% of patients.[14,24](#page-6-18) Because very few persons with mild diarrhea are tested for cryptosporidiosis, this apparent disease difference may be somewhat biased because the patients had especially severe disease or were part of an epidemic where diagnostic testing was done.

Some patients have joint pain, eye pain, recurrent headache, dizziness, and fatigue, which are more common with *C. hominis* than with *C. parvum*. [23](#page-6-13) *Cryptosporidium* can trigger inflammatory bowel disease and irritable bowel syndrome.[2](#page-6-7)

Persistent infection in immunocompromised persons may progress from asymptomatic to symptomatic as immune status declines. Biliary tract involvement may lead to clinical cholangiti[s18](#page-6-19) and respiratory disease, to mild hypoxia and shortness of breath.[15,18](#page-6-20)

<span id="page-3-1"></span>![](_page_3_Figure_11.jpeg)

Respiratory infection has been considered a rare HIV/AIDS complication, but recent data suggest it may occur in as many as a third of normal children with enteric infection[.25](#page-6-21) Furthermore, it has now been found in the sputum of HIV-positive and -negative adults undergoing testing for tuberculosis,[26](#page-6-22) suggesting that respiratory transmission may occur through sputum expectoration.[27](#page-6-23) In persons with HIV/AIDS, cryptosporidiosis causes increased mortality and shortened survival[.28](#page-6-14) In people with the cholera-like form of the disease characterized by massive fluid loss, severe abdominal pain, malabsorption, anorexia, and significant weight loss, survival may only be for days or several weeks. To summarize, variations in immune status and the extent and sites of infection contribute to differences in disease severity and survival[,19,20](#page-6-24) as may the species of the parasite.[13](#page-6-10)

# **PATIENT EVALUATION, DIAGNOSIS, AND DIFFERENTIAL DIAGNOSIS**

hospitals)

The medical focus with mild diarrheal disease is generally on detecting and preventing dehydration, rather than on making a specific diagnosis. Cryptosporidiosis is usually mild and thus underdiagnosed; as with most cryptosporidiosis, no diagnostic testing is performed. Suspicion for *Cryptosporidium* is increased when the patient has persistent or chronic diarrhea, is malnourished, or has an immunosuppressive condition or another risk factor [\(Box 96.1\)](#page-3-1). One important clue is that the incubation period is longer (≈1 week) than it is for viral or bacterial diseases (1–3 days) yet shorter than for giardiasis (≈2 weeks). The differential diagnoses for routine cryptosporidiosis include many hundreds of viral and bacterial pathogens, which have a similar presentation. *Giardia, Cystoisospora,* and *Cyclospora* infections may also mimic cryptosporidiosis.

Because cryptosporidiosis is a frequent cause of AIDS-related acute and chronic diarrhea, clinicians must have a low threshold for ordering these special tests in persons with known or suspected HIV. Many clinicians incorrectly believe that *Cryptosporidium* is detected via classical "ova and parasites" testing. The differential diagnosis of diarrhea in persons with AIDS includes not only common bacterial pathogens but also *Cryptosporidium,* species of microsporidia, *Cystoisospora belli, Mycobacterium avium* complex, and cytomegalovirus. In sub-Saharan Africa, the vast majority of chronic diarrhea in persons with HIV is caused by either

*Cryptosporidium* or microsporidia[.2](#page-6-7) Tests for *Cryptosporidium* should always be ordered when the cause for diarrhea is unclear.

Enteric cryptosporidiosis is diagnosed by examining stool specimens or by biopsy and examination of histologic sections of infected intestine, biliary system, or respiratory tract. *Cryptosporidium* oocysts are ≈5 µm in size. Fecal oocysts are detected using acid-fast staining, antigen detection via enzyme linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) or polymerase chain reaction (PCR), or a direct immunofluorescent antibody (DFA) assay.[29](#page-6-26) Oocysts can also be detected via direct wet-mounted feces microscopy [\(Fig. 96.4\)](#page-4-0). Detection of oocysts is easier if the number being excreted is high. In some laboratories, oocysts are concentrated using the modified ethyl acetate concentration method, with detection of stained fecal concentrates by microscopy. Modified acid-fast staining is frequently used in developing countries because of its low cost, ease of use, the ability to use a standard microscope, and simultaneous detection of other pathogens relevant to persons with HIV/AIDS, such as *Cystoisospora, Cyclospora,* and *Mycobacteria* species. In experienced hands, modified acid-fast staining and microscopy will detect ≈85% of the cases of cryptosporidiosis detected via PCR. In industrialized nations, antigen detection and DFA are increasingly prevalent. Oocysts are intermittently shed in stools. If *Cryptosporidium* infection is suspected and the initial stool specimen is negative, multiple specimens at intervals of 2 to 3 days should be examined.[29](#page-6-26) Yeasts are morphologically similar to *Cryptosporidium* spp. but do not stain or stain the same color as the counterstain. Many commercial or hospital laboratories do not routinely provide acid-fast staining when physicians request ova and parasite examinations; *Cryptosporidium* testing is only done with a specific request.

AIDS patients with *Cryptosporidium* sclerosing cholangitis usually have elevated serum alkaline phosphatase levels and right upper quadrant pain if there is also biliary involvement.[18](#page-6-19) Diagnosis is by endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography (ERCP) and biopsy. Ultrasonography or computed tomography may reveal biliary involvement but do not provide an etiologic diagnosis. Respiratory involvement in persons with AIDS is characterized by hypoxia and the presence of diffuse infiltrates on chest radiography. It can be diagnosed by detecting oocysts via acid-fast staining, DFA or PCR in sputa, or biopsy. Bronchoscopy may be necessary to differentiate it from *Pneumocystis* pneumonia. At this time the clinical significance of respiratory cryptosporidiosis in immunocompetent persons is unknown.

#### **TREATMENT AND PREVENTION**

Oral or intravenous rehydration, anti-motility agents, and nutritional support are used for the symptomatic treatment of diarrhea ([Box 96.2](#page-5-0))[.30](#page-6-27) Almost no drugs have been shown to be even modestly effective in controlled clinical trials.[12,31,32](#page-6-8) Nitazoxanide (NTZ) is the only Food and Drug Administration–approved drug for cryptosporidiosis. NTZ can shorten clinical disease by a day or so on average and reduce parasite loads in immunocompetent patients[.31](#page-6-25) Unfortunately, NTZ is not consistently effective for immunodeficient persons[18](#page-6-19) ([Table 96.2](#page-5-1)). An open-label study did find that a sustained positive clinical response was observed in 59% of 365 patients with HIV/AIDS who received high doses (500–1500 mg of NTZ twice daily) for prolonged periods (median of 62 days)[,33](#page-6-28) although it was unclear whether study patients were on antiretroviral therapy. However, a controlled trial of high-dose, prolonged (28 days) NTZ therapy in HIV-infected children found no significant benefit. Mortality did not differ between control and NTZ treatment arms and was 28% at 28 days. Our personal advice is that NTZ can be considered for mildly immunocompromised HIV/AIDS patients, for persons in whom cancer chemotherapy is being temporarily deferred because of cryptosporidiosis, or when trying to limit infection during highly active antiretroviral therapy (HAART) initiation[.32](#page-6-29) Paromomycin and macrolides, such as azithromycin, have led to anecdotal success, though not in controlled trials,[30,32](#page-6-27) and when no other options exist, they could be tried in combination with NTZ as a salvage attempt. No studies of NTZ in combination with other agents have been published, and thus we emphasize that HAART is the critical therapy for persons with HIV/AIDS.

The most effective *Cryptosporidium* treatment and prophylaxis for AIDS patients is HAART to restore cell-mediated immunity[.30,31,34](#page-6-27) It is believed that this is related to CD4<sup>+</sup> cell replenishment in treated persons[22](#page-6-17) and perhaps the anti-parasitic activities of HAART protease inhibitors[.31,34](#page-6-25) Some older protease inhibitors (indinavir, nelfinavir, and ritonavir) demonstrate anti-cryptosporidial activity[.30](#page-6-27) Relapse of cryptosporidiosis is common in AIDS patients who have stopped taking HAART[.12](#page-6-8) Because malnutrition may occur because of cryptosporidiosis, or contribute to its persistence, most experienced clinicians aggressively treat malnutrition. Nutritional support may help restore cellular immunity in the

severely malnourished and, in persons with HIV/AIDS, allow survival when HAART is being initiated.

Cholecystectomy may be used in the treatment of cryptosporidial acalculous cholecystitis, and ERCP with sphincterotomy and/or stent placement can ameliorate sclerosing cholangitis[.30](#page-6-27) The therapy of respiratory cryptosporidiosis has not been systematically explored. In our opinion, both biliary and respiratory disease in the immunocompromised is best treated by HAART or temporarily stopping the use of chemotherapy if the person has cancer.

# **Prevention**

To prevent fecal–oral transmission, strict attention to personal hygiene, especially handwashing, is emphasized. Cooking kills *Cryptosporidium* in food. Oocysts are killed by pasteurization (72°C for 5 seconds), heating to 60°C for 30 minutes, or freezing at −7°C for 1 hour. No safe and effective disinfectant has been identified for decontaminating produce. Should future work demonstrate that respiratory transmission occurs, preventive measures may need to be broadened to those for respiratory pathogens.

Preventing *Cryptosporidium* contamination of drinking water requires water filtration and purification systems that are often not available in lower-income countries. Sand filtration, however, is inexpensive and effective. Concentrations of chlorine (1–2 mg/L) used to disinfect drinking water are not effective against *Cryptosporidium.* Oocysts exposed to full-strength bleach can still infect mice. Personal-use filters that have an absolute pore size of 1 micron or smaller are effective.

Cryptosporidiosis can be avoided in the highly immunocompromised by education and careful avoidance behaviors to include drinking only filtered or boiled water, ingesting only cooked food, thorough handwashing, avoiding bathing or swimming in water used by other people or animals, and avoiding contact with people or animals (especially calves and lambs) with diarrhea. Companion dogs and cats should be examined and cleared of infection by a veterinarian.
