*Davidson H. Hamer, Natasha S. Hochberg*

## KEY FEATURES

- • Humans are accidental hosts to the intermediate larva of marine nematodes, especially *Anisakis pegreffi, A. simplex,* and *Pseudoterranova decipiens.*
- • Infection occurs after consumption of raw or undertreated marine fish or squid.
- • Although the greatest burden of disease is in Japan, increased awareness of anisakidosis and adventurous eating habits have resulted in a greater distribution of disease, with many cases diagnosed in recent years in Italy and Spain.
- • Major clinical syndromes include gastric, intestinal, extra-intestinal, and allergic anisakidosis.
- • Endoscopy can be used for both diagnosis and treatment of gastric anisakidosis.
- • Molecular methods are increasingly being used for speciation of human anisakidosis.
- • Prolonged freezing, flash freezing at low temperatures, and adequately cooking marine fish are effective for prevention.

#### **INTRODUCTION**

Anisakidosis was first recognized more than 50 years ago in the Netherlands; these nematodes are increasingly identified as causes of gastric, intestinal, and allergic syndromes. The term *anisakidosis* refers to disease caused by any member of the family Anisakidae, whereas *anisakiasis* is caused by worms of the genus *Anisakis,* and *pseudoterranovosis* by the genus *Pseudoterranova.* Although past case series suggested most human infections are caused by *Anisakis simplex* (the herring worm) and *Pseudoterranova decipiens* (cod or seal worm),[1,2](#page-3-0) molecular characterization suggests that *A. pegreffi* (which is difficult to distinguish from *A. simplex*), is responsible for a substantial portion of human infections.[3](#page-3-1) Other less common causes include *Pseudoterranova* complex (e.g., *P. cattani* and *P. azarasi*),[4,5](#page-3-2) *A. physeteris, Contracaecum* spp., and *Thynnascaris* spp.

#### **EPIDEMIOLOGY**

Of the estimated 20,000 cases reported worldwide, more than 90% occur in Japan[.6](#page-3-3) Most other cases have been described in Korea and Europe, especially the Netherlands, Spain, Italy, Germany, and France. A modeling analysis that utilized data on fish infection rates, fishing location, and fish consumption (largely raw anchovies) predicted approximately 8000 cases of anisakidosis yearly in Spain[.7](#page-3-4) There have been increasing reports from the United States, Canada, Brazil, Chile, Egypt, and New Zealand. The increased prevalence can be attributed to more reporting, improved diagnosis, greater consumption of raw seafood, and larger populations of the definitive hosts.[8](#page-3-5) Although there have been approximately 60 cases reported in the United States, anisakidosis is most likely underdiagnosed and underreported.

Anisakidosis is acquired after consuming raw, marinated, or incompletely cooked marine fish. In Japan, infections occur more frequently in coastal populations and in men aged 20 to 50 years. Fish served in sushi bars tend to be uncommonly contaminated or even free of *Anisakis* as sushi chefs have expertise in identifying larvae. The risk of infection is greater with less expensive fish such as cod, herring, and mackerel that are more frequently consumed at home (and may not be examined for larvae). The main fish species responsible for anisakidosis are mackerel and squid in Japan, herring in the Netherlands, Pacific salmon in the United States, and pickled anchovies in Spain. Pseudoterranovosis rarely occurs in Japan and Europe but is more frequent in the United States and Canada; *P. decipiens* is mainly transmitted by cod [\(Fig. 125.1\)](#page-0-0), Pacific halibut, wild salmon, and red snapper.

Limited data from seafood markets in Japan and Spain suggest that substantial proportions of marine fish are infected, and larvae have been detected in farmed fish. In Spain, fish from the Atlantic Ocean have greater rates of infection than those from the Mediterranean. Prevalence of infection may vary by season and fish size.

#### **NATURAL HISTORY, PATHOGENESIS, AND PATHOLOGY**

Adult worms are found in the stomachs or intestines of marine mammals[.9](#page-3-6) Primary hosts for *Anisakis* spp. are dolphins, porpoises, and whales. Primary hosts for *P. decipiens* are seals, walruses, and sea lions. Eggs, passed in the feces, undergo embryonation in seawater; after passing through the L1 stage, they develop into free-living larvae (L2) that infect intermediate hosts, usually crustaceans (e.g., krill) [\(Fig. 125.2](#page-1-0)). Within these first intermediate hosts, the parasite matures into L3 larvae that are subsequently

ingested by marine fish or squid (transport or second intermediate hosts). The third-stage larvae migrate into host viscera, peritoneal cavity, and musculature. When a marine mammal (final host) ingests uncooked fish or squid, larvae develop into the fourth-stage and adult worms.

After ingestion of raw or undercooked fish or squid by humans (accidental host), larvae embed themselves in the gastric or intestinal mucosa and then die. The burrowing or dead larva precipitates a hypersensitivity reaction characterized by a granulomatous, eosinophilic infiltrate.

#### **CLINICAL FEATURES**

There are four major clinical syndromes in humans: gastric, intestinal, ectopic (or extra-gastrointestinal), and allergi[c8](#page-3-5) ([Table 125.1](#page-2-0)). Infection with *P. decipiens* usually involves only the stomach and tends to cause milder disease than *Anisakis* spp. Asymptomatic infections with *Pseudoterranova* spp. may come to medical attention when the patient coughs up a worm. This usually occurs within 48 hours of ingesting fish and may be preceded by "tingling throat syndrome" (sensation of a worm crawling in the esophagus or pharynx).

Gastric anisakidosis is characterized by severe epigastric pain (usually 1–12 hours after raw fish ingestion), nausea, vomiting, and low-grade fever [\(Fig. 125.3\)](#page-2-1); infected individuals may report odynophagia. There is frequently leukocytosis that is rarely associated with eosinophilia. Untreated gastric disease may lead to ulcer-like symptoms that last months.

Intestinal anisakidosis manifests with intermittent or constant abdominal pain. Symptoms often appear 5 to 7 days (or longer) after exposure. Intestinal infections predominantly occur in the terminal ileum and less commonly in the jejunum or colon. Rare

<span id="page-2-1"></span>complications include bloody diarrhea, intestinal obstruction, ileal stenosis, intussusception, intestinal perforation, peritonitis, and pneumoperitoneum.

Ectopic, extra-gastrointestinal, and intraperitoneal anisakiasis result from rare larval penetration of the stomach or intestine. Larvae can migrate within the peritoneal cavity (causing peritonitis) and, less commonly, in the pleural cavity, mesentery, liver, pancreas, ovary, and subcutaneous tissue.

Anisakidosis may cause serious allergic responses.[10,11](#page-3-7) Generally, within 1 to 2 hours (up to more than 24 hours) after ingesting infected fish, allergic reactions develop. Manifestations range from respiratory symptoms (dyspnea or wheezing), gastrointestinal symptoms (abdominal pain, vomiting), urticaria, and isolated angioedema to anaphylaxis[.11](#page-3-8) Urticaria can be chronic. Allergic reactions are accompanied by high levels of IgE, including anti–*A. simplex* IgE, which can persist for years. Greater fish consumption and occupational exposure (e.g., fish processing) are associated with increased allergy risk. Allergic anisakidosis has been reported after airborne exposure[.12](#page-3-9)

### **PATIENT EVALUATION, DIAGNOSIS, AND DIFFERENTIAL DIAGNOSIS**

In the setting of acute abdominal pain, a patient's food history is an important diagnostic clue. Examination of larvae after gastroscopic or surgical removal provides a definitive diagnosis. Endoscopy can reveal the worm in the gastric mucosa, as well as erythema, edema, erosions, a tumor-like nodule, or thickened gastric folds. Gastric anisakidosis can be mistaken for peptic ulcers, gastritis, or carcinoma. Because of the non-specific symptoms of intestinal infection, the differential diagnosis is broad and includes appendicitis, ileitis, diverticulitis, eosinophilic gastroenteritis, cholecystitis, colonic tumor, and inflammatory bowel disease. Extra-intestinal infections can be confused with acute peritonitis, tuberculous peritonitis, and pancreatic cancer.

Detection of anti–*A. simplex* IgE by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay, latex agglutination, or other immunoassays can diagnose anisakiasis when a clinical diagnosis cannot be made[.10,11](#page-3-7) The diagnosis of allergy to *A. simplex* rests on a history of allergic reactions after consumption or exposure to fish, positive skin-prick test, elevated anti–*A. simplex* IgE (as close in time to the episode as possible), and a lack of reaction to fish proteins. Multiplex polymerase chain reaction methods can identify nematodes in fish and those isolated from humans.

#### **TREATMENT**

Endoscopic extraction is the preferred treatment of gastric anisakidosis unless the larva is spontaneously regurgitated. Surgical removal may be necessary for intestinal or extra-intestinal infections, especially if complications such as intestinal obstruction, appendicitis, or peritonitis occur. If the diagnosis of intestinal anisakidosis can be established without an invasive procedure, then supportive therapy will often lead to clinical resolution. Limited evidence suggests that albendazole (400 mg daily or 400 mg twice daily for 6–21 days) is effective[8](#page-3-5) ; however, albendazole performed poorly in a rat model of infection.[13](#page-3-10)

#### **PREVENTION**

Preventive measures include avoiding consumption of raw or inadequately cooked, marinated, or salted marine fish, squid, and potentially clams. Examining fish, extracting parasites, and removing heavily parasitized fish can reduce risk. Examination of fish internal organs after overnight incubation in water may increase diagnostic yield, and eviscerating fish as soon as possible may prevent migration from the intestinal tract into the edible musculature. Additional protective measures include thorough cooking, freezing at −20°C (−4°F) for 7 days, or blast freezing to −35°C (−31°F) for 15 hours or longer.
