# **132** Cystic Echinococcosis

*Christina M. Coyle, Thomas Junghanss*

### KEY FEATURES

- • Zoonotic parasitic disease principally transmitted between dogs and domestic livestock, particularly sheep.
- • Human cystic echinococcosis occurs in parts of the world where sheep are raised and dogs are used to herd livestock.
- • The liver is the most common site of the echinococcal cysts followed by lungs; cysts occur less frequently in the spleen, kidneys, heart, bone, and central nervous system.
- • Treatment options include surgery, anti-helminthic agents, percutaneous interventions, and the "watch and wait"' method.

#### **INTRODUCTION**

Cystic echinococcosis (CE) is the infection of humans and mammals by the larval stage of the zoonotic cestode *Echinococcus granulosus.*[1,2](#page-6-0)

#### **EPIDEMIOLOGY**

Echinococcal infection has a worldwide distribution and has only been eradicated in Iceland, New Zealand, and the Australian state of Tasmania. It is endemic in pastoral communities where dogs are used to care for flocks of sheep.[3](#page-6-1) It is widely distributed in South America, Eastern Europe, North Africa, the Middle East, Central Asia, eastern Russia, and western China.[3](#page-6-1) In South America, echinococcosis is endemic in Argentina, Bolivia, Chile, southern Brazil, Peru, and Uruguay[.3](#page-6-1) Feeding raw infected viscera of slaughtered livestock to dogs facilitates transmission of *E. granulosus.*

#### **NATURAL HISTORY, PATHOGENESIS, AND PATHOLOGY**

The adult tapeworm of *E. granulosus* parasitizes a wide variety of canids (e.g., domestic dogs, foxes, wolves, and dingoes), which serve as final, definitive hosts. These worms are small, ranging in size from 2 to 12 mm in length, with three to six segments. They typically localize in the lower duodenum and jejunum. Eggs (embryophores) containing infective embryos are expelled in large numbers in the feces of the definitive host. Intermediate hosts are usually livestock (particularly sheep) that acquire infection by ingestion of eggs in pastures [\(Fig. 132.1\)](#page-1-0). If humans ingest eggs, embryos or oncospheres are released in the stomach, penetrate the intestinal wall, and are transported by the bloodstream to the liver or other organs. Once they reach their final location, they develop into echinococcal cysts, the metacestode form. Cysts are fluid-filled, spherical, and unilocular with an inner germinal layer of cells supported by acellular, laminated membranes of variable thickness. Surrounding this endocyst is a host-derived connective tissue capsule termed the *pericyst*. Small vesicles called *brood capsules* bud internally from the germinal layer and develop asexually into pre-adult worms called *protoscolices*.

Release of cyst fluid and dissemination of protoscolices due to cyst rupture or spillage during surgery or percutaneous interventions can result in allergic reactions and multiple secondary cysts, as protoscolices can develop into secondary cysts. As cysts degenerate the content becomes jellylike and solid. Regions of cysts can remain active while other areas solidify as they transition to inactive cysts. Fistulas in the capsule become clinically relevant if the cyst ruptures and drains into the biliary tree. This can also occur in lung cysts leading to cysto-bronchial communication.

In humans, slowly growing cysts can attain a volume of several liters and contain many thousands of protoscolices [\(Fig. 132.2A](#page-1-1) [and B\)](#page-1-1). With time they can degenerate or develop daughter cysts. Imaging, in particular, ultrasound (US), has elucidated the natural evolution of CE cysts and led to staging. In 1995 the World Health Organization-Informal Working Group on Echinococcosis (WHO-IWGE) developed a five-stage classification system (CE1–5)[.4](#page-6-2) Stage CE3 is sub-classified into CE3a and CE3b [\(Fig. 132.3\)](#page-2-0). Stages are sub-grouped into active (CE1, CE2), transitional (CE3a, CE3b), and inactive (CE4, CE5). The transitional sub-group reflects passage from CE1/2 to CE4/5. Studies of cyst contents have shown that CE3a cysts have equal probability of being viable or non-viable, whereas CE3b cysts are usually viable[.5](#page-6-3) Understanding cyst architecture and staging and whether or not cysts are viable is critical for management plans.[6](#page-6-4)

## **CLINICAL FEATURES**

Signs and symptoms of CE depend on the organ involved and the size of the cysts. The onset of symptoms varies from months to several years and results from pressure of growing cysts or complications. Cysts occur more frequently in the liver (70%), followed by the lungs (15%–30%) and other locations. Most infections have a single cyst.

#### **Liver Cysts**

Symptoms, frequently right upper quadrant pain or discomfort, are due to enlarging cysts, which exert a mass effect. The right lobe of the liver is usually involved[.7](#page-6-5) A cysto-biliary fistula should be considered when there is acute or intermittent pain mimicking biliary colic. Patients with cysto-biliary fistula can present with jaundice and increased liver enzymes (bilirubin, alkaline phosphatase, and gamma-glutamyl transferase) and are at risk of developing bacterial cholangitis.[6,8,9](#page-6-4) Infrequently, the cyst cavity becomes superinfected and patients present with a hepatic abscess [\(Fig.](#page-2-1) [132.4A and B](#page-2-1)). In a retrospective series of 116 patients undergoing surgery for hepatic CE, up to 24% were found to have asymptomatic biliary leakage with larger cysts associated with biliary–cyst communication[.10](#page-6-6) Other complications include spontaneous or traumatic rupture, compression of the biliary tree, and Budd–Chiari syndrome. Rarely the cysts can rupture into the venous system and embolize.[11,12](#page-6-7)

#### **Lung Cysts**

Uncomplicated lung cysts rarely produce symptoms and are usually found incidentally after a routine chest radiograph. There is generally a single cyst found more often on the right side and in the lower lobes.[13](#page-6-8) In up to 25% of cases there is a co-existing hepatic cyst. Pulmonary cysts are multiple and/or bilateral in approximately 30% of cases. As the period of initial cyst growth is frequently asymptomatic, pulmonary CE often presents when

<span id="page-3-0"></span>cysts have reached substantial sizes. Asymptomatic cysts are often found where chest x-rays (CXR) are taken for mass tuberculosis screening.

Chest pain with cough, dyspnea, and hemoptysis are typical in symptomatic persons[.13,14](#page-6-8) Fever is less common and usually seen with bacterial superinfection. Compression of a bronchus can result in pneumonia, atelectasis, bronchiectasis, and interstitial fibrosis. Cysto-bronchial fistulas can lead to expectoration of cyst content and cause asphyxia and anaphylaxis ([Fig. 132.5](#page-3-0)). Patients will report a typical "salty water and grape skin" expectoration. This can be followed by bacterial overgrowth and abscess formation.[15](#page-6-9) Rupture into the pleural space can cause pneumothorax and empyema, allergic reactions (e.g., pruritus, urticaria), and rarely, anaphylactic shock and secondary CE.

#### **Other Sites**

The spleen is the next most common abdominal organ affected, accounting for 3% to 5% of all abdominal cysts. Heart, bone, spinal, and central nervous system are rare complications[.12,16–20](#page-6-10) CE of the right heart can cause pulmonary CE embolism[.12,18–21](#page-6-10) It is of note that in bone/spinal CE, *E. granulosus* grows infiltratively and pericysts are missing.

#### **PATIENT EVALUATION, DIAGNOSIS, AND DIFFERENTIAL DIAGNOSIS**

The differential diagnosis of CE depends on the organ affected and the cyst stage. CE liver cysts must be differentiated from other space-occupying lesions, including congenital liver cysts, choledochal cysts, amebic or bacterial liver abscesses, and primary and secondary hepatic tumors. The differential of pulmonary involvement is bronchogenic cysts, post-primary cavernous tuberculosis, lung abscesses, and primary and metastatic pulmonary malignancies. Complex renal cysts and renal cell carcinoma can be confused with CE cysts.

Imaging is the cornerstone of diagnosis; epidemiology increases the pre-test probability, and serology has a confirmatory role[.7](#page-6-5)

The WHO-IWGE's classification has three groupings of cysts based on US features: active CE (CE1 and 2), CE3a and b, and inactive (CE4 and CE5). CE3 cysts are differentiated by their imaging features into CE3a (a cyst with detached endocyst) and CE3b (partially solid with daughter cysts)[22](#page-6-11) (see [Fig. 132.3](#page-2-0)). Using this classification, therapy is tailored based on cyst activity, location, and complications. US can also follow treatment response and monitor for early relapse. If lesions are not accessible by US, magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) is preferable over computed tomography (CT[\)23](#page-6-12) ([Fig. 132.6A–C\)](#page-4-0). Small cysts are usually uncomplicated; the risk of complications increases with cyst size[.10](#page-6-6)

The US features of the WHO stages CE1–CE5 are depicted in [Fig. 132.3.](#page-2-0) The cyst contents, rather than the cyst wall properties, are most important for determining cyst activity[.4](#page-6-2) The "double-line" sign of a CE1 cyst is pathognomonic, but its absence does not rule out CE [\(Fig. 132.7\)](#page-4-1). As a CE1 cyst transitions, the endocyst pulls off the pericyst and creates a "water-lily sign" (CE3a cyst). It ultimately collapses and solidifies to become an inactive CE4 cyst. When CE4 cysts relapse, daughter cysts develop within the solidified matrix and develop into CE3b cysts (see [Fig. 132.3\)](#page-2-0). A solidified cyst with a heavily calcified cyst wall is a CE5 cyst. Calcification can be seen in all the stages[.24](#page-6-13)

A CXR can pick up lung cysts, but CT and MRI are better in depicting them. MRI is preferred because of its superior visualization of cyst content and for staging. Pulmonary CE appears as one or more homogenous round or oval masses with smooth borders surrounded by normal lung tissue; daughter cysts are rarely seen. Large cysts can shift the mediastinum, induce a pleural reaction, or cause atelectasis of the surrounding parenchyma. A "meniscus" sign is the introduction of air between the laminated membrane and the pericyst[.14](#page-6-14)

If the cyst communicates with the tracheobronchial tree, an air–fluid level can be seen. Fluid can also spill into the opposite lung; a double-lumen endotracheal tube can be lifesaving. Pleural effusion can occur secondary to cyst rupture into the pleural space.

Serological diagnosis is dependent on the stage and the location of the cyst. Early cysts, CE1 and also CE2, may be seronegative as their antigenic components are sequestered from the host's immune system by the parasite-derived layer of the cyst. The serology becomes positive as the endocyst pulls off due to natural involution or treatment. As the cyst consolidates and calcifies (CE4 and CE5 cysts) serology can become negative. Indirect hemagglutination (IH) tests and enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) using *E. granulosus* hydatid fluid antigen lack specificity and cross-react with other cestode infections and gastrointestinal malignancies. The immunoblot using 8kDa/12kDa subunits of *E. granulosus* antigen B are used to confirm the findings of either the ELISA or IH. Location, in addition to the stage of the cyst, must be taken into consideration when interpreting serologic results. Extra-hepatic cysts,such as brain and lung cysts, can be especially challenging as a high proportion of these give false-negative results. Lastly, serology cannot be used to follow response to an intervention to determine cure or relapse.[25](#page-6-15)

Parasitologic examination of expectorated or aspirated fluid may reveal protoscolices and/or hooklets [\(Fig. 132.8\)](#page-4-2).

#### **MANAGEMENT AND TREATMENT**

There are four treatment modalities: drug treatment with benzimidazoles, percutaneous techniques, surgery, and the "watch and wait" method. Expert opinion has moved away from surgical management in uncomplicated cysts, especially early small cysts and CE4 and CE5 cysts.

#### **Benzimidazole Therapy**

Both albendazole (ABZ) (10–15 mg/kg/day) divided in two daily doses and mebendazole (40–50 mg/kg/day) in three divided doses

have efficacy in CE.[6,26](#page-6-4) ABZ is the preferred agent because of its pharmacokinetics that favor intestinal absorption and penetration into the cyst. Administration of ABZ with fat-rich meals facilitates absorption and bioavailability.[27](#page-6-16) Peak serum levels are reached 2 to 5 hours after ingestion, and the elimination half-life is 8 to 12 hours.[28](#page-6-17) Significant concentrations of ABZ are found inside the CE cysts[.29](#page-6-18)

Adverse reactions that are generally reversible upon drug discontinuation need to be monitored: abdominal discomfort (common at initiation of therapy), alopecia (rare), liver toxicity (rare), and agranulocytosis (extremely rare)[.30](#page-6-19) Liver function tests and white blood cells should be drawn on days 0, 5, 10, and 30 of treatment and then weekly and stretched to monthly, every 3 months, and every 6 months. Bone marrow suppression is rare; reversible leucopenia has occurred in <1% of patients.[31](#page-6-20) ABZ is teratogenic in rats and rabbits; therefore its use is contraindicated during pregnancy[.32,33](#page-6-21)

Recent studies suggest that drug therapy with mebendazole or ABZ can provide an alternative to surgery in patients with uncomplicated cysts; however, these studies were small and heterogeneous.[26,34–49](#page-6-22) A systematic review of data from 711 treated patients with 1308 cysts from six countries using the WHO classification found a strong association between cyst activity and response to treatment. Highly active, small (<6 cm) CE1 cysts had a better response to benzimidazole treatment, suggesting an association in treatment response to cyst size[.50](#page-7-0) Stage CE3b cysts respond poorly. Some experts believe that a course of at least 3 to 6 months should be employed. In all treatment courses the cyst should be followed for involution (solidification or decrease in size)[,6,22](#page-6-4) and at least 12 months should pass before drug treatment is termed a failure. After benzimidazole treatment follow-up is recommended for a minimum of 5 years after cysts have reached an inactive stage (CE4 and CE5).[6](#page-6-4)

The use of ABZ for prevention of secondary CE after interventions (e.g., surgery, percutaneous treatment, diagnostic puncture) or after spontaneous rupture is less well studied. The WHO-IWGE currently recommends starting albendazole 4 hours before the intervention (percutaneous treatment or surgery) until 1 to 3 months after the intervention.[22](#page-6-11)

Praziquantel has been given in combination withABZ as medical pre- and post-intervention therapy to prevent secondary CE based on its activity against protoscolices. However, there are no formal recommendations on its use as adjunctive therapy.[51](#page-7-1)

If a cysto-biliary communication is suspected, an MR cholangiography is 95% sensitive in identifying the risk of complications and plan for surgery.[9](#page-6-23) Cysts can become secondarily infected, leading to an abscess either in the liver or lung due to a cysto-biliary or cysto-bronchial communication. Management is similar to a bacterial abscess: antibiotics and drainage when necessary. Bacterial superinfection most likely sterilizes the CE cyst, but benzimidazoles are still administered for a prolonged period.

#### **Percutaneous Treatment of Hepatic Cysts Under Ultrasonographic Guidance**

Percutaneous treatments of CE using a scolicidal agent injected into the cyst cavity aim to evacuate the cyst contents and inactivate the protosolices and germinal layer of the endocyst.

PAIR is a technique that consists of the following: (1) Percutaneous cyst puncture using sonographic guidance (or CT). (2) Aspiration of the liquid contents and (2a) test content for bilirubin and injection of contrast medium to see if there is cysto-biliary fistula. If there is, injection of protoscolicidal agents will lead to sclerosing cholangitis and loss of the liver.[52,53](#page-7-2). (3) Aspiration of contrast medium and injection of a protoscolicidal agent (e.g., 20% sodium chloride) that remains in the cyst cavity for 10 to 15 minutes. (4) Re-aspiration. ABZ prophylaxis is recommended 4 hours before and for 1 month after the intervention.[22](#page-6-11)

The indications for PAIR are CE1 and CE3a cysts with a diameter of 5–6 cm to <10 cm in which a cysto-biliary fistula has been ruled out.[22](#page-6-11) PAIR should not be undertaken in superficial liver cysts, as the cyst should be sufficiently covered by hepatic parenchyma to avoid cyst rupture and spillage when the needle is removed[.54](#page-7-3) A Cochrane review found two randomized trials examining PAIR. One documented that PAIR was equally effective as surgery with fewer adverse effects.[55,56](#page-7-4) Another small trial reported that PAIR with or without ABZ was more effective than ABZ alone.[57](#page-7-5)

Modifications of the PAIR protocol using continuous drainage have been proposed for large (>10 cm) CE1 and CE3a cysts; this has been safe and effective.[58](#page-7-6) Promising results have also been published on treatment of CE2 and CE3b cysts with the modified catheterization technique.[59](#page-7-7) Percutaneously treated patients should be followed for a minimum of 5 years.

#### **Surgery**

Surgery has been the treatment of choice for CE3b and CE2 cysts, large cysts (>10 cm diameter) (see the section on new percutaneous methods earlier), secondarily infected cysts, and cysts located in certain organs (i.e., brain, heart). There are two major surgical approaches: partial cystectomy and total cystectomy with resection. Partial cystectomy involves removal of the parasitederived cyst components (endocyst) and part of the pericyst (host-derived connective tissue capsule). The surgeon must prevent spillage of hydatid fluid when the cyst is punctured and cyst material is removed. Contamination of instruments and gloves should be avoided, as there is the risk of transferring germinal-layer cells and protoscolices to the peritoneum or pleura. Sterilization of the cavity with 20% sodium chloride can be done, but the surgeon must assure there is no cysto-biliary fistula. If there is doubt, this step should not be done. Twenty percent sodium chloride must not come into contact with the peritoneum.

Perioperative ABZ prophylaxis is recommended to minimize the risk of secondary CE from spillage of fluid.[60](#page-7-8) The area around the cyst should be packed with pads soaked with 20% sodium chloride with a protective layer of normal saline soaked to shield normal tissue from the caustic effects of hypertonic saline. In total cystectomy both the endocyst and pericyst are removed in entirety along with resection of the part of the organ in which the CE cyst is embedded ([Fig. 132.9A and B](#page-6-24)). In liver cysts, the residual cavity is usually managed with omentoplasty.[6](#page-6-4) Patients should be followed for a minimum of 5 years.

#### **"Watch and Wait"**

Cysts transition from an early active cyst (CE1, CE2) into an inactive cyst. US surveys document cysts that have consolidated and calcified and have become inactive (CE4 and CE5). If such lesions do not compromise organ functions or cause symptoms, then a "watch and wait" approach can safely be taken, leaving the cysts untreated. US monitoring should be done for a minimum of 5 years. If active cysts have been pushed into inactive cyst stages (CE4, CE5) with ABZ, relapse to active cysts—mostly CE3b—is frequently observed and, hence, long follow-up periods are needed to guarantee inactivation.[61,62](#page-7-9)

#### **PREVENTION**

Measures to control CE include mass treatment of dogs, dog registration, reduction of stray dog numbers, upgrading of abattoirs, meat inspection, and vaccination of the intermediate host. The recent EG95 vaccine has a 95% effectiveness against ovine CE. No dog vaccines are available. A combination of vaccination and anti-helminthic treatment of dogs is a promising innovative approach[.63,64](#page-7-10)
