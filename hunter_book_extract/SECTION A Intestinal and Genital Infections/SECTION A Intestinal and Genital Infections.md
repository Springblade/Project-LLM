# *Entamoeba histolytica* (Amebiasis)

*Debbie-Ann Shirley, Chien-Ching Hung, Shannon Moonah*

#### KEY FEATURES

- • *Entamoeba histolytica,* the cause of amebiasis, is microscopically indistinguishable from the non-pathogenic parasite *E. dispar;* differentiation requires stool antigen detection or polymerase chain reaction (PCR).
- • Infection with *E. histolytica* occurs worldwide and is transmitted by the ingestion of fecally contaminated food and water or by oral–anal sexual contact.
- • Intestinal amebiasis may be asymptomatic or cause colitis and extra-intestinal disease, particularly liver abscess.
- • Diagnosis of amebiasis can be achieved through stool antigen detection and serologic testing, or by molecular assay if available, as traditionally utilized microscopic examination of stool is of limited value.
- • Nitroimidazoles, in particular, metronidazole or tinidazole, are the mainstay of therapy for invasive amebiasis and should be followed with a luminal agent to cure intestinal infection.
- • Preventive efforts presently focus on hand hygiene, food and water safety, and avoidance of fecal–oral exposure

### **EPIDEMIOLOGY**

*Entamoeba histolytica* has a worldwide distribution, but is disproportionately more prevalent in low-income countries accounting for ~100,000 deaths annually.[1](#page-6-0) Early microscopic surveys are confounded by the re-description of *E. histolytica* into two species: *E. histolytica,* which is pathogenic, and *E. dispar,* which is not, but is more common[.2](#page-6-1) Further molecular studies have identified other *Entamoeba* species, including *E. moshkovskii,* which also causes diarrhea,[3,4](#page-6-2) and the newest species to be described, *E. bangladeshi.*[5,6](#page-6-3) Microscopy cannot distinguish *E. histolytica* cysts or trophozoites from other *Entamoeba* species; thus previous prevalence studies regarding *E. histolytica* based on microscopy alone are likely flawed. Serologic studies are more reliable, as *E. histolytica* generates a serum antibody response whereas *E. dispar* and *E. moshkovskii* do not. A large survey from Mexico showed that 8.4% of persons have been exposed.[7](#page-6-4) In Dhaka, Bangladesh, an *E. histolytica*–specific fecal antigen assay revealed infection in 80% of pre-school children over the course of 4 years, with an incidence of diarrhea and dysentery of 0.09 and 0.03 per child-year, respectively[.8](#page-6-5) *E. histolytica* was identified among the top seven pathogens causing dysentery in young children under the age of 5 years living in developing countries[.9](#page-6-6) There is little gender variation in amebiasis in children; however, in the adult population, invasive disease is more common in males than females, particularly for liver abscess, but also for colitis, with an overall male-to-female ratio between 3 and 10:1[.10](#page-6-7) In central Vietnam, the incidence of amebic liver abscess peaks at 125/100,000 in 40-year-old adult males[.11](#page-6-8) Epidemiology on incidence of amebiasis in Africa is particularly limited, but appears widespread.[12](#page-6-9)

In developed countries, most cases are imported with high-risk populations, including returned travelers, expatriates, and immigrants. The GeoSentinel network revealed that *E. histolytica* is the third most frequently isolated pathogen among returning travelers with infectious gastrointestinal disease seeking care at specialized clinics, accounting for 12.5% of all microbiologically confirmed cases[.13](#page-6-10) Approximately 5% of immigrants to the United States from Africa may have *E. histolytica/E. dispar/E. moshkovskii* in their stools.[14](#page-6-11) Studies in the 1980s revealed that men who have sex with men (MSM) were at high risk of intestinal infection with *E. dispar.*[15,16](#page-6-12) However, recent studies from Taiwan, Japan, Korea, and Australia have shown high rates of invasive *E. histolytica* infection in HIV-infected MSM.[17,18](#page-6-13) The reasons for this are unclear, as globally and in sub-Saharan Africa it has not been appreciated that HIV-infected persons are more susceptible to amebiasis.

Although animal reservoirs of *E. histolytica* and *E. dispar* have been described, they are not thought to play a major role in transmission. Human-to-human and fecal–oral transmission are the major sources of human infections. Persons of all ages are susceptible to infection. Low infectious dose (<100 organisms), chlorine resistance, and environmental stability allow *E. histolytica* to cause outbreaks of infection, such as that reported among institutionalized persons in Japan.[19](#page-6-14)

## **TRANSMISSION**

*E. histolytica* exists in two forms: the infective cyst form, which can transform to the tissue-invasive trophozoite form ([Fig. 94.1](#page-1-0)). Transmission occurs after ingestion of an amebic cyst from fecally contaminated food or water or via oral–anal sexual practices. Excystment occurs in the small intestine. The resulting small metacystic trophozoites are carried into the cecum with the fecal stream where colonization and tissue invasion occur, depending on the virulence of the infecting strain. Cysts are relatively hardy and can survive outside the body long enough to be ingested. They are sensitive to desiccation and to temperatures of >40°C and <5°C and are killed almost immediately by boiling. They are moderately resistant to chlorine, not being destroyed by concentrations usually used for water purification. Cysts may remain viable for 1 month at 4°C in both sewage and natural surface water. Cysts have survived for as long as 48 hours at room temperature on cheese, bread, green salads, and fruits. In contrast, motile trophozoites passed with diarrheal or dysenteric stools can survive only briefly outside the body and are destroyed by gastric secretions, and therefore have no role in transmission.

Approximately 90% of individuals will remain asymptomatic after ingestion of an infective amebic cyst, and most will eventually clear the parasite. Symptoms develop after an incubation period of 2 to 4 weeks. Diarrhea is the most common manifestation of disease, followed by dysentery and then extra-intestinal abscess. Prospective studies of asymptomatic carriers indicate a risk of ≈9% progression to dysentery or liver abscess over the ensuing year.[20](#page-6-15) This clinical variability, from asymptomatic carriage to dysentery, was captured in Walker and Sellards' human challenge studies of 1913[.21](#page-6-16)

#### **PATHOGENESIS AND PATHOLOGY**

Cytotoxicity, inflammation, and tissue invasion are the hallmarks of *E. histolytica* pathogenesis. Although host inflammatory cells represent a line of defense, the parasite has developed a number of mechanisms to evade these attacks and persist[.22](#page-6-17) Parasiteepithelial cell interaction results in chemokine production and subsequent neutrophil recruitment, tissue damage, and a characteristic flask-shaped ulcer may develop ([Fig. 94.2](#page-1-1)). *E. histolytica* secretes a macrophage migration inhibitory factor (*Eh*MIF) homolog, which is a pro-inflammatory cytokine that modulates host immune function, potentially contributing to tissue damage seen in amebic colitis[.23,24](#page-6-18) A positive correlation was found between *Eh*MIF levels and intestinal inflammation in persons with amebiasis.

Amebiasis is seen most frequently in the cecum and ascending colon, although the sigmoid colon, rectum, and appendix can also be involved. In a minority of infections, parasites presumably find sub-mucosal blood vessels and embolize to produce liver abscesses. Most cases of extra-intestinal abscess exist without evidence of co-existing intestinal infection, and most cases of colitis exist without extra-intestinal abscess, such that stool studies are only

40% sensitive for detection of *E. histolytica* during liver abscess. Rarely, liver abscess can directly rupture into the pleura or pericardium; at other times, parasites can be carried hematogenously to distant sites such as the brain.

#### **CLINICAL FEATURES**

#### **Intestinal Amebiasis**

Intestinal amebiasis includes asymptomatic colonization, but infection can progress to symptomatic intestinal disease and its subsequent complications of amebic colitis, fulminant colitis (toxic megacolon), intestinal perforation [\(Fig. 94.3\)](#page-2-0), peritonitis, intraabdominal abscess, amebic appendicitis, hemorrhage, ameboma (a tumor-like mass of granulation tissue arising from amebiasis), amebic stricture, and perianal cutaneous amebiasis.

Asymptomatic intestinal infection with *E. histolytica/E. dispar/ E. moshkovskii* may be diagnosed incidentally during stool examination for ova and parasites, for instance, during screening posttravelers or in immigrants. Symptomatic disease is mostly associated with *E. histolytica* infection.

Intestinal amebiasis presents as a spectrum of disease from acute amebic dysenteric colitis to a more chronic non-dysenteric colitis that presents sub-acutely with a non-specific watery diarrhea, and can be misdiagnosed as inflammatory bowel disease (IBD)[.25](#page-6-19) Approximately 8% of *E. histolytica*–associated diarrhea cases will have visible blood (dysentery),[26](#page-6-20) and abdominal pain is seen in ≈40%. Fever occurs in a minority of cases. Onset of symptoms is often gradual over several weeks and is often associated with weight loss.

Patients with extensive trans-mural colonic involvement may present acutely with concomitant bacterial peritonitis after intestinal perforation. These patients are toxic, febrile, and hypotensive and have profuse bloody diarrhea, diffuse abdominal pain, and abdominal distension with signs of peritoneal irritation. Fulminant colitis or toxic megacolon occurs rarely (<0.5% of cases), but is associated with a mortality of more than 40%. Malnourished persons, pregnant women, corticosteroid users, and very young children may be at increased risk of developing more severe complications.[25](#page-6-19) Surgical intervention is indicated for bowel perforation, although attempts to suture such necrotic bowels are usually unsuccessful.

Some report a chronic syndrome of intermittent diarrhea, abdominal pain, flatulence, and weight loss for months in patients with ameba in the stool and positive anti-amebic serologic tests.

(Taken from Shirley DA, Moonah S: Fulminant amebic colitis after corticosteroids therapy: a systemic review. PLOS NTD 10(7): e0004879; 2016.)

Not all patients respond to anti-amebic therapy, so the role of *E. histolytica* in all instances is unclear. However, a trial of therapy is reasonable, as is ruling out IBD, as amebiasis may worsen if corticosteroids are started.

The formation of annular colonic granulation tissue at a single or multiple sites after the healing of amebic ulcers leads to an intestinal mass called an *ameboma*. It usually involves the cecum or ascending colon and may mimic carcinoma of the colon. The same fibrosis may also lead to intestinal stricture. Amebic appendicitis almost always occurs as a complication of trans-mural amebic colitis and should be considered in the presence of other signs of amebiasis. However, isolated amebic appendicitis has been described in a patient with a prior history of colitis.[27](#page-6-21)

Peri-anal amebiasis may result from extension of severe bowel disease to the skin. Lesions can be ulcerative or condylomatous, enlarge slowly over weeks to months, and result in pain and bleeding. The diagnosis of cutaneous amebiasis requires a high index of suspicion, especially primary disease not associated with intestinal symptoms. The characteristic cutaneous ulcer is well demarcated, round, or oval, with heaped-up borders and an erythematous halo. Motile trophozoites can be visualized in a fresh smear of the ulcer exudate or a scraping of the ulcer edge.

West of Mobile, AL.)

#### **Extra-Intestinal Amebiasis**

Amebic liver abscess may occur in the presence or absence of intestinal symptoms. It often develops after a latent period after earlier diarrhea or other intestinal illness, particularly in those with a history of residence or prior travel to endemic areas. Amebic liver abscess is the most common extra-intestinal manifestation of amebiasis and can present in a variety of ways. The syndrome is most often seen in adult males, aged 20 to 40 years old. Approximately 80% of patients in endemic areas present within 2 to 4 week[s28](#page-6-22); however most returning travelers present, on average, 3 months after leaving the endemic area. Onset can be insidious, sub-acute, or acute. Symptoms include fever; a non-productive cough; and a constant, dull, aching pain in the right upper quadrant or epigastrium. Pleuritic pain in the right lower anterior chest or right hypochondrium is common. In a minority of patients a sub-acute course may present with prominent weight loss with less fever and abdominal pain. Hepatomegaly with point tenderness over the liver below the ribs or in the intercostal spaces is a typical finding. Right lobe lesions are usually single lesions and about five times more common than left lobe lesions ([Fig. 94.4\)](#page-2-1). Right-sided pleural pain or referred shoulder pain occurs when the diaphragmatic surface of the liver is involved. Associated gastrointestinal symptoms occur in a minority of patients (10%–35%) with a liver abscess. Leukocytosis in the range of 12,000 to 20,000/mm3 is seen in most cases, with mild normochromic normocytic anemia in more than half. Peripheral eosinophilia is not seen in either hepatic or intestinal amebiasis. Patients with acute amebic liver abscess tend to have a normal alkaline phosphatase level and elevated transaminase[s29;](#page-6-23) the opposite is true for those with more chronic disease. Ultrasonography, abdominal computed tomography (CT), and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) are all excellent for detecting liver abscesses (see [Fig. 94.4\)](#page-2-1).

Pleuropulmonary amebiasis is the most common complication of amebic liver abscess and can take the form of pneumonitis, lung abscess, or bronchohepatic fistula.[30](#page-6-24) It generally occurs as a result of the rupture of a superior right lobe abscess with erosion through the diaphragm to involve the pleural space, lung parenchyma, or bronchus. In contrast, serous pleural effusion and atelectasis are common findings and do not indicate extension of disease (see [Fig. 94.4\)](#page-2-1). Intra-peritoneal rupture occurs rarely but is associated with a high mortality. Left lobe abscesses are more likely to progress to rupture because of late clinical presentation. Pericardial amebiasis, a rare complication, usually presents with fever and abdominal pain with progression to chest pain. Signs are typical of pericarditis, including a friction rub.

Cerebral amebiasis has an abrupt onset and progresses rapidly to death over 12 to 72 hours without adequate therapy[.31](#page-6-25) Thus

(B) CT of a patient with amebic liver abscess (*arrow*) who presented with fever, right upper quadrant pain, and pleuritic pain. (C) MRI of amebic liver abscess (*arrow*).

when patients with known amebiasis have alteration of mental status or focal signs, amebic brain abscess or encephalitis should be considered and CT or MRI of the brain should be performed if available. Genitourinary amebiasis is rare and includes rectovaginal fistulas and vulvar lesions, in women, and penile amebiasis, in MSM in particular[.32](#page-6-26)

## **PATIENT EVALUATION, DIAGNOSIS, AND DIFFERENTIAL DIAGNOSIS**

The differential diagnosis of non-specific infectious diarrhea involves a long list of bacterial, toxin-mediated, viral, and parasitic causes, which clinical features cannot distinguish. Consideration for amebiasis should occur when a patient has diarrhea that is not improving with conservative management. In many countries, metronidazole is used abundantly for empiric management of diarrhea, such that many cases of amebiasis are probably treated. There are multiple ways to evaluate patients with suspected amebiasis, including microscopy, antigen detection, molecular diagnosis with polymerase chain reaction (PCR) techniques, serology, endoscopic procedures, and imaging modalities.

#### **Microscopy**

Globally, the most commonly available laboratory technique is stool microscopy; typically only a saline wet mount is performed, which is only useful for visualization of motile trophozoites. Additionally, a stained slide will allow visualization of morphologic features, including 10- to 15-µm quadrinucleate cysts and trophozoites with ingested red blood cells (see [Fig. 94.1](#page-1-0)), which is more compatible with *E. histolytica* than *E. dispar* or *E. moshkovskii.* Amebic cysts and trophozoites are passed intermittently in the stool, and therefore three stools should ideally be submitted, as this has increased the sensitivity of detection by 23%.[33](#page-6-27) In some series, 18% of stools with *E. histolytica* diarrhea will be hemoccult positive. Fecal leukocytes are variable, and Charcot–Leyden crystals have been reported. In general, microscopy is neither sensitive nor specific; an experienced eye is required for visualization, and *E. histolytica* cannot be differentiated from *E. dispar* or *E. moshkovshii.*

#### **Antigen Detection**

Current antigen detection tests are a great advance over microscopy; however, they are expensive and poorly available in resource-limited settings. Presently, there are several commercially available antigen kits for detecting *Entamoeba* (TechLab *E. histolytica* II, Blacksburg, VA, USA; Ridascreen *Entamoeba,* R-Biopharm, Darmstadt, Germany; Triage Micro Parasite Panel, Biosite Diagnostics, Inc., San Diego, CA, USA; ProSpecT *E. histolytica,* Remel, Inc., Lenexa, KS, USA; CELISA Path, Cellabs, Brookvale, Australia). Unfortunately, though these tests are rapid and easy to perform, they require fresh, not fixative-preserved, stool for analysis. The TechLab and Cellabs kits report being specific for *E. histolytica* (detect the *E. histolytica*–derived Gal/ GalNAc-specific lectin) and thus offer the benefit of excluding *E. dispar* and *E. moshkovskii.*[34](#page-6-28)

#### **PCR**

Laboratories can perform PCR on stool or liver abscess pus, as well as isoenzyme analysis on cultured trophozoites to confirm *E. histolytica* with excellent sensitivity.

#### **Serology**

Serum antibodies should be detectable in >70% of patients with amebic colitis and >90% of patients with liver abscess and thus should be obtained on all patients when the diagnosis is being considered. Depending on the method used, the serologic response can remain positive for 5 years; thus in an individual from an endemic area, a positive result may not readily distinguish between acute and prior infection. However, a negative result has a strong negative predictive value and is useful for exclusion of infection. The indirect hemagglutination assay is reported to be the most sensitive, whereas the enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay is most commonly available.

#### **Endoscopic Procedures**

Colonoscopy is preferred over flexible sigmoidoscopy because disease may be limited to the right side (ascending) of the colon or the cecum. Bowel cleansing with cathartics or enemas should not be done so as to optimize identification of parasites. The endoscopist should aspirate material from the ulcer base and ulcer margin. The gross appearance of the intestinal mucosa in amebic colitis is granular, friable, and diffusely ulcerated and may be indistinguishable from that seen in IBD (see [Fig. 94.3\)](#page-2-0).

#### **Imaging Procedures**

Imaging of the liver when amebic hepatic abscess is suspected can be made by ultrasonography, CT, or MRI (see [Fig. 94.4](#page-2-1)). Ultrasonography reveals abscesses as hypo-echoic lesions. CT with administration of contrast material shows the abscess center as non-enhancing, surrounded by an irregular, or rimlike, area of inflammation that shows increased enhancement (see [Fig. 94.4](#page-2-1)). Echinococcal cysts of the liver, which typically do not cause fever or tenderness, are distinguishable from amebic and pyogenic abscesses by CT (multiple clustered fluid collections without surrounding stranding or enhancement).

Thus the primary consideration in the differential diagnosis of amebic liver abscess is the distinction between pyogenic abscess and amebic abscess. The two cannot be distinguished clinically. Amebic liver abscesses are often large, single abscesses of the right lobe, whereas pyogenic abscesses more often are multiple, but the overlap is significant[.35](#page-6-29) Pyogenic liver abscess is much more common than amebic liver abscess in developed countries, is usually associated with positive blood cultures in half of patients, and patients tend to be older than 50 years, presenting with jaundice and abnormalities of the gallbladder and inter-hepatic ducts on imaging. Empiric antibiotics can be tried, but if the patient is progressing and the diagnosis is unclear despite blood cultures, serology, and stool studies, many patients undergo aspiration for diagnosis. Upon aspiration, amebic abscesses are described as "anchovy paste," chocolate-colored fluid consisting predominantly of necrotic hepatocytes ([Fig. 94.5](#page-4-0)). Gram stain is negative, unlike most cases of pyogenic liver abscess. Trophozoites are rarely seen from aspirates, as these are usually found at the junction of the abscess and viable liver, which usually requires an open drainage procedure[.36,37](#page-6-30)

#### **Other**

The differential diagnosis of amebic dysentery includes any other dysenteric infection; thus bacterial stool culture should be performed to identify *Shigella, Campylobacter, Salmonella,* enteroinvasive *Escherichia coli,* and enterohemorrhagic *E. coli.* Non-infectious causes of abdominal pain and bloody diarrhea include IBD, ischemic colitis, diverticulitis, and arterio-venous malformation. Occasionally, patients with ongoing intestinal symptoms undergo colonoscopy with biopsy, and the diagnosis is made by the pathologist, where clues include patchy areas of ulceration and periodic acid–Schiff staining trophozoites (not to be confused with macrophages). IBD has been confused pathologically with amebic colitis; thus in a patient with possible exposure to *E. histolytica,* the diagnosis of IBD should be confirmed with the pathologist, as steroids can worsen amebiasis[.25](#page-6-19)

## <span id="page-4-0"></span>**TREATMENT**

#### **Amebic Colitis**

Since the 1960s, the mainstay of therapy for amebic colitis has been the nitroimidazoles, in particular, metronidazole and tinidazole. Powell and co-workers performed the first clinical trial of metronidazole in patients with acute amebic dysentery, which demonstrated the superiority of 800 mg three times daily (tid) given for 10 days[.38](#page-6-31) Lower doses were less effective, but subsequent studies have demonstrated that the 800 mg by mouth (PO) tid regimen can be shortened to 5 days[.39,40](#page-6-35) Newer studies have successfully used nitroimidazoles with longer half-lives, including tinidazole,[41](#page-6-36) secnidazole[,42](#page-6-37) and ornidazole, for even shorter durations. Tinidazole has had the most experience, is better tolerated than metronidazole, and can be administered for only 3 days ([Table 94.1\)](#page-5-0).[43,44](#page-6-38) The common side effects of metronidazole include nausea, headache, anorexia, and a metallic taste; less common ones include a disulfiram-like reaction to alcohol, vomiting, and peripheral neuropathy. The nitroimidazoles are rapidly absorbed after oral administration and are not effective against luminal trophozoites and exhibit a 40% to 60% rate of parasite persistence in the intestine after therapy with these agents[.20,45](#page-6-15) Therefore a course of treatment should be followed with a course of a luminal agent, such as the non-absorbable aminoglycoside paromomycin ([Table 94.1](#page-5-0)). A potential newer agent for intestinal amebiasis is nitazoxanide. This drug administered at 500 mg PO twice daily for 3 days was associated with resolution of *E. histolytica*–associated diarrhea in 80% to 90% of patients (vs. 40%–50% in patients receiving placebo) along with microscopic improvement.[46](#page-6-32)

#### **Amebic Liver Abscess**

The initial amebic colitis trials with metronidazole also included groups of "not severely ill patients" with amebic liver abscess. Liver abscess was found to be, in general, more responsive than colitis. We recommend the standard high dose of metronidazole for 10 days or tinidazole for 5 days [\(Table 94.1](#page-5-0))[,47](#page-6-33) as the lower-dose or single-dose groups had slower recoveries or more failures.[48](#page-6-39)

![](_page_4_Figure_10.jpeg)

<span id="page-4-1"></span>**Fig. 94.6** Algorithmic approach to the management of amebic liver abscess.

#### **Severe Disease**

The metronidazole trials to date have been in "not severely ill patients." In a severely ill patient who cannot take oral medications, such as those with fulminant amebic colitis, it is logical to assume that intravenous metronidazole would be effective in these patients; however, data are limited to a case series from Japan that showed promise[.49](#page-6-34) When patients fail medical treatment, surgical consultation should be considered. Open surgery is indicated for acute abdomen, gastrointestinal bleeding, or toxic megacolon,[50](#page-6-40) as mortality is extremely high, and broad-spectrum antibiotics should be added for bacterial spillage into the peritoneum.

#### **Drainage**

When antimicrobial therapy is failing, liver abscess drainage plays a role in the prevention of impending rupture. Any liver abscess rupture is a high-mortality event (6%–30%), particularly if into the pericardium,[51](#page-6-41) and requires open surgery. Given the high mortality, the question of when to prophylactically drain an abscess arises. Criteria that would prompt consideration of drainage include an abscess >10 cm in diameter, a left lobe abscess to prevent rupture into the pericardium, or any abscess close to a serosal surface (see [Fig. 94.4](#page-2-1)). Aspiration is also indicated for abscesses that are not promptly responding to drugs alone and for abscesses of uncertain cause [\(Fig. 94.6\)](#page-4-1). The majority of amebic liver abscesses that are relatively small (<10 cm) usually respond to drug therapy alone. Many studies indicate that routine drainage of amebic liver abscess confers no clinical benefit over antibiotics alone,[52](#page-6-42) and a meta-analysis concluded therapeutic aspiration could not be supported or refuted because of lack of evidence.[53](#page-6-43) One study showed that failure to respond by 72 hours in terms of prolonged fever, leukocytosis, and hepatomegaly identified a group at high risk for abscess rupture.[51](#page-6-41) We therefore feel that ongoing pain while on appropriate therapy for 72 hours is a reasonable criteria for drainage, especially with large left lobe abscesses, as these are associated with a greater frequency of complications[.37](#page-6-44) Percutaneous aspiration under ultrasound or CT guidance has shown good results compared with open drainage or needle aspiration.[52](#page-6-42) Serial liver scans and sonograms have shown that most liver abscesses completely heal 4 to 8 months after therapy. The resolution time may be longer for large abscesses; however, patients usually remain asymptomatic in these cases.

#### **Asymptomatic Intestinal Colonization**

The World Health Organization recommends against treatment of asymptomatic patients when only a microscopic diagnosis by stool examination is available (i.e., *E. histolytica*/*E. dispar/E. moshkovskii*)[.1](#page-6-0) If *E. histolytica* is confirmed by specific testing (fecal antigen test, serology) or is suspected (e.g., close contact with a case of invasive amebiasis or during an outbreak of amebiasis), then treatment is appropriate. At least three classes of luminal agents have shown efficacy in clinical trials for asymptomatic intestinal colonization: dichloracetanilide derivatives, oral aminoglycosides, and 5-hydroxyquinolines. The specific agents include diloxanide furoate, paromomycin, and iodoquinol/diiodohydroxyquinoline. All have a large, worldwide experience and poor gastrointestinal absorption, which allows high luminal concentrations but renders them less effective in invasive disease. One of these courses should always be given after a treatment course for invasive intestinal or extra-intestinal disease to reduce the rate of relapse.

Paromomycin has also been effective in a number of trials[.54,55](#page-6-45) We consider it our drug of choice for luminal infection because it is widely available and demonstrated better efficacy than diloxanide ([Table 94.1\)](#page-5-0)[.56](#page-7-1) Many of these have also shown cure rates for mild invasive disease.[57](#page-7-4) Side effects with oral therapy are generally mild, but include diarrhea and other gastrointestinal disturbances and, less commonly, headache and dizziness. Therapy should be given with meals and for a full 7 days, as failures have occurred with shorter courses.

Diloxanide furoate is a relative of chloramphenicol used since the 1950s. The Centers for Disease Control (CDC) experience with the drug from 1977 to 1990 documented a parasitologic cure rate in 86% of patients with asymptomatic *E. histolytica*/ *E. dispar* infection.[56](#page-7-1) The drug is well tolerated, with only 14% of patients reporting mild side effects—mainly flatulence or other gastrointestinal symptoms. In the United States, the drug is only available through compounding pharmacies. Iodoquinol (diiodohydroxyquinoline) has been widely used for asymptomatic intestinal colonization because it is effective and inexpensive. A large study in India found it to be 85% effective in non-dysenteric *E. histolytica* patients[.57](#page-7-4) However, it requires a 20-day course, and there have been case reports of loss of vision[58, 61;](#page-7-3) we would thus consider it a second-line agent. Common side effects include constipation and enlargement of the thyroid gland (the drug contains 64% iodine) [\(Box 94.1](#page-5-5)).

#### **PREVENTION**

There is no vaccine available to prevent amebiasis. The demonstration of partial immunity supports ongoing efforts toward vaccine development[.59](#page-7-8) Preventive efforts presently focus on hand hygiene, food and water safety, and avoidance of fecal–oral exposure. Household contacts of patients with amebic infection should also be tested for amebiasis.

<span id="page-5-5"></span>**BOX 94.1** Anti-Amebic Drugs for Children and Pregnant Women

#### **CHILDREN**

Most anti-amebic drugs mentioned have pediatric dosing regimens ([Table 94.1\)](#page-5-0). Tinidazole is only approved in the United States in children over 3 years old and nitazoxanide in children over 1 year old.

#### **PREGNANCY**

Of the drugs mentioned for asymptomatic infection, paromomycin has been used safely in pregnancy[57](#page-7-4) and would be the drug of choice. For invasive intestinal disease, there is continued controversy over the use of metronidazole in pregnancy, with reports of facial defects and central nervous system tumors in children born to mothers taking metronidazole in the first trimester,[64](#page-7-5) but large analyses have simultaneously found no increased risk above controls.[65](#page-7-6) A caveat is that the dose used for *E. histolytica* infection is higher than that used in most analyses. Some would recommend a trial of paromomycin for mild invasive intestinal disease.[66](#page-7-7) For severe colitis or liver abscess, we feel that the risk of metronidazole to the fetus is less than that of the disease to the mother, particularly in the second or third trimester. One could consider trying chloroquine for liver abscess, as this drug has been used safely (at lower doses) in pregnant women for malaria prophylaxis.
