# **<sup>153</sup> 153** Persistent Abdominal Symptoms in the Returned Traveler

*Mark S. Riddle, Bradley A. Connor*

## KEY FEATURES

- • Persistent diarrhea (diarrhea lasting ≥14 days) is one of the most common syndromes in returned travelers.
- • Persistent abdominal symptoms beyond diarrhea comprise an increasingly recognized clinical entity, which is not completely understood.
- • Pathoetiology is complex and generally falls in the categories of persistent (or cryptic) infection, post-infectious process (including malabsorptive states and functional gastrointestinal disorders), and unmasking of structural or organic gastrointestinal disease.
- • Evaluation combines thorough history, stool examinations, hematology, and in some cases endoscopy. Culture-independent diagnostics are both advancing and complicating the diagnosis and management of these disorders.
- • Targeted and empiric antimicrobial therapies for presumptive infectious etiologies, dietary changes (e.g., for those with secondary lactose intolerance), and symptomatic and targeted therapies for functional bowel disorders and organic disease should be used as appropriate.

## **INTRODUCTION**

Acute diarrheal disease is common among travelers to tropical regions of the world and is a frequent illness in returned travelers. Incidence rates of acute travelers' diarrhea range from 10% to 40% per trip and depend on a number of factors, including location of travel, duration of travel, and risk-based nature of the itinerary[.1,2](#page-3-0) Among returning travelers, acute diarrhea accounts for roughly 22% of returning travelers seeking medical care[.3](#page-3-1) Large high-quality population-based studies are lacking in both number and standardization of outcome to estimate incidence and disease burden. Historically, persistent diarrhea rates (e.g., illness lasting more than 2 weeks) have been reported in 3% to 10% of travelers, with 1% to 3% reporting symptoms lasting for a month or more[.4–8](#page-3-2) These studies also suggest that chronic diarrhea occurs more frequently in expatriates (those living and working overseas) and in longer-term travelers. Recent studies from military travelers who are at high risk for acute infection have found similar rates, with about 10% of troops who deployed to Iraq and Afghanistan reporting persistent diarrhea, and about 3% reporting chronic diarrhea (e.g., lasting 30 days or more) while on long-term deployment[.9](#page-3-3) Furthermore, though not describing incidence, a global surveillance network of travel and tropical medicine clinics (GeoSentinel) reports that nearly 1 out of every 10 ill-returning travelers seeking medical care at member facilities report chronic diarrhea[.3](#page-3-1)

There are numerous reports that define non-diarrheal gastrointestinal complaints after travel and, specifically, travel-associated acute enteric infection. A large cohort study of short-stay travelers to Mexico who were excluded if they had any pre-existing chronic abdominal symptoms were followed for 6 months after returning from travel[.10](#page-3-4) Post-travel, 4% of travelers met criteria for irritable bowel syndrome (IBS), and an additional 28% reported persistent abdominal symptoms (PAS) other than diarrhea at the 6-month follow-up. These symptoms included bloating, abdominal pain, and loose stools not meeting the IBS definition. The likelihood of symptoms was associated with acute diarrhea during travel and with an inverse association with age. Studies on Gulf War veterans who deployed once and did not re-deploy further supports the increased risk and frequency of persistent non-diarrheal gastrointestinal complaints after enteric infection, including loss of appetite, constipation, nausea, abdominal pain and cramps, vomiting, and flatulence or burping.[11](#page-3-5)

## **PATHOETIOLOGIC CLASSIFICATION**

Diagnoses of the syndrome complex of PAS in returned travelers can be divided broadly into categories of infectious, post-infectious process, and structural or organic disease [\(Table](#page-1-0) 153.1). A general rule is that the longer the duration of symptoms, the less likely an infectious diagnosis will be made. Chronic symptoms can be seen during giardiasis, cryptosporidiosis, cyclosporiasis, amebiasis, and cystoisosporiasis. Chronic campylobacteriosis can also occur. *Clostridium difficile* is also a potential cause of persistent diarrhea, though its incidence is quite low in ill-returning travelers[.12](#page-3-6) *Strongyloides stercoralis,* an intestinal nematode infection, is of particular importance in the long-term traveler (as well as immigrants).[13](#page-3-7)

*Blastocystis hominis* has been a subject of much study and debate[.14](#page-3-8) This organism is found widely in humans and animals, and has gone through an evolution of classification, including as a yeast and fungi, as well as an ameboid, flagellated, and sporozoan protozoa.[15](#page-3-9) More recent molecular studies have placed *B. hominis* within the group stramenopiles[,16](#page-3-10) though even this is controversial, as the stramenopiles have flagella surrounded by lateral hairs (e.g., mastigonemes), which are characteristically absent in *Blastocystis.* Stramenopiles are unicellular and multicellular protists, including brown algae, diatoms, chrysophytes, water molds, and slime nets. Observational studies are plentiful that describe the clinical features associated with blastocystosis. However, in adequately designed case-control studies, an association with acute disease has not been consistently observed[.17–20](#page-3-11) Recent efforts have aimed at characterizing unique pathovars, though this has also proven confusing because there appears to be variation in pathogenicity even within subtypes.[21](#page-3-12) Co-pathogens, dietary factors, and parasite load may also play a role.[22](#page-3-13) It is quite possible that *Blastocystis* is not a true pathogen but may occupy an ecologic niche reflecting an altered microbiota.

As the chronicity of symptoms continues, the likelihood of a post (non)-infectious process increases. Although not extensively studied in travelers, the development of secondary (and self-limited) dietary intolerances may occur after an episode of acute travelers' diarrhea[.18](#page-3-14) However, given that enteric infection and antibiotic use are known to result in transient dysbiosis,[23,24](#page-3-15) it is quite possible that perturbation of the digestive and metabolic potential and function of the host could result in transient changes in tolerance to certain food groups. One particular category of dysbiosis

that may be contributory to PAS after travel is small intestinal bacterial overgrowth (SIBO). SIBO is characterized by excessive overgrowth of bacteria in the small intestine and shares clinical and epidemiologic overlap with post-infectious irritable bowel syndrome (PI-IBS) and post-infectious malabsorptive syndromes[.25](#page-3-16) Although structural, surgical, and other organic disease processes are known to increase an individual's risk of SIBO, there is increasing mechanistic evidence that gastrointestinal infection can trigger SIBO, particularly after *Campylobacter* infections.[26,27](#page-3-17) Idiopathic bile acid malabsorption (BAM) after gastrointestinal infection can also occur. Although not well studied, the symptoms of BAM are consistent with the PAS symptom complex seen in returning travelers, and idiopathic BAM has been documented in observational studies and described to persist for several years.[28,29](#page-3-18) While more rigorous case-control studies have not been done and underlying pathology associated with this acquired deficiency has not been elucidated (though SIBO may be a factor), this diagnosis ought to be considered in the returning traveler with chronic watery diarrhea.

Functional bowel disorders, by definition, are diagnoses of exclusion in the setting of stable and distressing abdominal symptoms where no infectious, structural, or organic process has been identified and may include one or more underlying abnormalities such as a motility disturbance, visceral hypersensitivity, altered mucosal and immune function, altered gut microbiota, and altered central nervous system processing. The prototypical functional bowel disorder that has been most commonly linked to a posttravelers' diarrhea clinical outcome is PI-IBS. A working definition of PI-IBS based on the Rome IV criteria is a new-onset clinical disorder where the following criteria are fulfilled for the last 3 months with symptom onset at least 6 months before diagnosis, and this new-onset clinical disorder followed within 6 months of an acute (presumptive or confirmed) gastrointestinal infection. The symptom-based criteria are recurrent abdominal pain, on average, at least 1 day/week in the last 3 months, associated with at least two of the following: related to defecation, associated with a change in frequency of stool, or associated with a change in form (appearance) of stool. In addition, no infectious, structural, or organic etiology is identified that could explain the symptoms. IBS can be further sub-typed into diarrhea, constipation, and mixed sub-types based on the predominant pattern of change in the form of the stool. A recent systematic review found an association between travelers' diarrhea and IBS.[30](#page-3-19)

Although rare, the unmasking of organic or structural gastrointestinal disorders such as inflammatory bowel disease, celiac disease, and colon cancer should be considered. In older travelers, conditions unrelated to travel need further consideration such as diverticulitis, ischemic colitis, and colonic cancer.

## **ASSESSMENT**

It is important to take a thorough history of exposures and presenting symptoms to narrow the list of diagnostic possibilities and avoid unnecessary testing [\(Table](#page-2-0) 153.2). Location, duration, and itinerary of travel are important. Long duration of travel, as well as adventure-travel itineraries that expose individuals to freshwater, soil-transmitted helminths, or prolonged unsanitary conditions and high-risk meals will likely increase the risk of parasitosis. If diarrhea is a predominant or significant symptom, the quality and quantity are important as to whether it is watery, greasy, or contains blood. Secretory diarrhea is often associated with large-volume stools that occur despite fasting. Similarly, greasy and malodorous stools may represent a malabsorptive process.Blood likely represents an invasive infectious process or inflammatory bowel disease and needs to be distinguished from bleeding anal fissures or hemorrhoids. Non-diarrheal symptoms are equally important, including the presence and timing of nausea, bloating, distension, and abdominal pain, as well as their exacerbation or relief by distinctive dietary exposures and bowel movements.

Given the prevalence of functional bowel disorders in the general population, the possibility of a pre-existing condition also needs consideration. It is quite possible that infection, stress of travel, or other environmental exposure could have exacerbated or somehow changed an underlying functional bowel disorder[.31,32](#page-3-20)

## **INVESTIGATIONS**

Although somewhat arbitrary, the differentiation of duration of symptoms may be helpful, as the longer the symptoms persist, the more expansive the diagnostic workup may need to be to come to a positive diagnosis or give reason to try an empiric therapeutic approach. A general diagnostic approach is outlined in Fig. [153.1.](#page-2-1) In all patients, initial stool studies should be done. Although traditionally stool culture, microscopy, and immunoassays have been the gold-standard stool diagnostics, the increasing availability of rapid molecular-based diagnostics has introduced new tools in evaluating ill-returning travelers with PAS.[12](#page-3-6) However, such diagnostic platforms currently lack studies supporting their diagnostic efficiency in ill-returning travelers with PAS, although they do appear to increase diagnostic yield in non–travel-associated pediatric diarrhea compared with stool microscopy and immunoassays for *Giardia* infections,[33,34](#page-3-21) and can often yield a more rapid result.[35](#page-3-22) However, although possibly more sensitive in detection of putative pathogens, they also often identify multiple potential pathogens without a clear ability to attribute cause[.36](#page-3-23)

If initial testing of stool for infectious etiologies is unrevealing and symptoms persist and are not abating, hematologic testing may be helpful. Eosinophilia may suggest hookworm infection, strongyloidiasis, schistosomiasis, or food allergies.

Depending on symptoms, studies looking for malabsorptive etiologies (e.g., BAM, secondary disaccharidase deficiency) and SIBO (breath testing) may be helpful and could lead to targeted therapies. As these post-infectious causes are ruled out or empiric directed therapies fail, the likelihood of a post-infectious functional bowel disorder increases. Although still primarily a diagnosis of exclusion, a recent blood test has been developed that measures an individual's antibody level to cytolethal distending toxin and vinculin and appears to discriminate patients with diarrheapredominant IBS (IBS-D) from other organic causes of chronic diarrhea (e.g., celiac disease and inflammatory bowel disease).[37](#page-4-0) A small pilot study among military personnel with new-onset IBS found that levels of anti-vinculin antibodies were higher among individuals with *Campylobacter*-associated IBS compared with "other" post-infectious IBS, lending support to the potential application

#### <span id="page-2-0"></span>**TABLE 153.2** Management Strategies for the Ill-Returning Traveler With Persistent Abdominal Symptoms

#### **History**

- 1. Location and duration of travel and particular features of travel that might be high risk for soil-transmitted helminths or water-borne protozoa
- 2. Timing of the symptom onset in relation to travel, development of acute traveler's diarrhea, and/or antibiotic use
- 3. Careful history of gastrointestinal symptoms preceding recent travel, which may indicate the pre-existing nature of a functional bowel disorder or other organic/structural disorder
- 4. Quantitative and phenotypic features of stool, including spectrum from solid to liquid (Bristol Scale Chart may be useful), greasy, floating, malodorous, containing blood or mucus, etc., as well as frequency, volume, and association with any other GI symptoms
- 5. Association with particular food types (e.g., milk or fatty foods) and relationship in time to taking in meals
- 6. Any alarm features to include fever, night sweats, weight loss, and nocturnal symptoms

#### **Diagnostics**

- 1. Stool studies for common protozoal pathogens and bacterial causes of persistent abdominal symptoms (e.g., *Giardia*, *Cryptosporidium*, *Entamoeba hystolitica, Clostridium difficile, Campylobacter* spp., *Salmonella* spp.)
- 2. Serologies directed toward patient history, exposure, and clinical symptomatology to include *Strongyloides*
- 3. Hematology—WBC and particularly eosinophilia would be directive toward an extraintestinal protozoa
- 4. Additional blood chemistries—C-reactive protein, erythrocyte sedimentation rate, liver function tests
- 5. Other—intestinal malabsorption studies, breath testing for SIBO
- 6. Upper endoscopy/colonoscopy to rule out structural and organic disease as indicated

#### **Suggested Treatments (Ideally Based Upon Positive Identification; Empirical Strategies Sometimes Indicated; Alternative Regimens May Be Equivalent) (Adult Doses Listed)**

- 1. Anti-bacterial therapy: Azithromycin 500 mg qd × 3 days
- 2. Giardiasis: Metronidazole 250 mg tid 5–7 days OR tinidazole 2 g one dose OR nitazoxanide 500 mg bid × 3 days
- 3. Cryptosporidiosis: Nitazoxanide 500 mg bid × 3 days
- 4. Amebiasis: Metronidazole 750 mg tid 5–10 days followed by luminal agent (diloxanide furoate 500 mg tid × 10 days OR paromomycin 25–35 mg/ kg/d tid × 7 days) OR nitazoxanide 500 mg bid for 3 days
- 5. Strongyloides: Ivermectin 200 µg/kg/d × 2 days
- 6. Empiric anti-protozoal/anti-helminthic therapy: Tinidazole 1000 mg bid × 2 days followed by oral albendazole 400 mg bid × 5 days (NOTE: in locations where albendazole is cost-prohibitive, tinidazole alone may be tried) OR nitazoxanide 500 mg bid × 3 days
- 7. Functional bowel disorder (IBS-D most common):
  - • Identify key patient characteristics
- • Educate and reassure the patient, trial of lifestyle/dietary modification
- • Optimize treatment for predominant symptoms (e.g., diarrhea, bloating, pain), preference, and availability. May include anti-motility, bile acid sequestrants, rifaximin, probiotics, anti-spasmodics, eluxadoline, TCAs, low-FODMAP diet (bloating)
- • Follow-up: Reassess every 4–8 weeks (until stable) to assess response, tolerability, and reassurances
- 8. Small intestinal bacterial overgrowth/IBS-D: Rifaximin 550 mg three times daily for 2 weeks (repeat dosing may be necessary for recurrent symptoms)
- 9. Food-associated symptoms: Avoid and slowly reintroduce; bile-acid sequestrants if indicated
- *GI*, Gastrointestinal; *IBS-D,* diarrhea-predominant inflammatory bowel disease; *SIBO*, small intestine bacterial overgrowth; *TCA*, tricyclic antidepressants; *WBC*, white blood cell count.

in post-infectious-IBS,[38](#page-4-1) though more studies are needed. If the clinical scenario suggests an increased risk for structural or organic disease, blood work for celiac disease, liver function testing, nonspecific inflammatory markers (e.g., erythrocyte sedimentation rate, C-reactive protein), and standard chemistry and hematology should be ordered and a gastroenterologist consulted.

## **MANAGEMENT**

Routine testing as outlined in [Table](#page-2-0) 153.2 and Fig. [153.1](#page-2-1) will often reveal a diagnosis. If an infectious agent is discovered through stool and/or serum diagnostic testing, this should be treated as described for the more common etiologies, as well as consulting specific pathogen chapters of this textbook. If initial studies are negative (or unavailable), including those for non-infectious etiologies, some advocate empirical treatment for a protozoal etiology.[39–41](#page-4-2) Options include a single dose of a tinidazole at 2 g for adults or nitazoxanide 500 mg twice a day for 3 days.[41,42](#page-4-3)

Other post-infectious processes such as food intolerances should be treated with reassurance that they are likely to resolve and to engage in dietary modification in the interim. For the returning traveler in whom BAM is identified, a number of bile acid sequestrants could be used. For patients with long-term symptoms (months) and no etiology, a post-infectious functional bowel disorder (e.g., IBS) becomes most likely and management of such should be instituted. Post-infectious IBS, like all functional disorders, has a complex etiology with different mechanisms likely contributing to the constellation of symptoms. A recent simplified evidence-based and expert consensus algorithm for management was put forth and provides a logical approach to treating the long-term as well as newly diagnosed IBS patient.[42](#page-4-4) Fundamentals of management include confidently naming and explaining the IBS diagnosis for the patient, followed by assessment of key patient characteristics and predominant symptoms, which will direct appropriate therapies, and shared patient decision making. Followup consultations should include education and reassurance with an explanatory model of IBS tailored to the individual patient. Shared decision making on lifestyle changes, dietary modifications, pharmacologic therapies, psychological strategies, or a combination of interventions may be used to optimize treatment for each patient. Given that post-infectious IBS is often of the diarrhea-predominant sub-type and in patients with bloating as a predominant symptom, a trial of rifaximin 550 mg three times daily for 2 weeks may be warranted, given its success, particularly in those in whom SIBO may have been identified[.43](#page-4-5)
