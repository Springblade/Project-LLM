# **<sup>134</sup> 134** Polycystic Echinococcosis (Polycystic Neotropical Echinococcus)

*Christina M. Coyle*

#### KEY FEATURES

- • Human polycystic echinococcus, caused by *Echinococcus vogeli* or *E. oligarthrus,* is confined to Central and South America and is referred to as polycystic neotropical echinococcus (NE).
- • Nearly all cases of polycystic NE are caused by *E. vogeli; E. oligarthrus* is rare.
- • *E. vogeli* is a zoonotic parasite principally transmitted between the definitive host, the bush dog (*Speothos venaticus*), and the intermediate host, the paca (*Cuniculus paca*).
- • The primary localization of *E. vogeli* infection is the liver, but cysts often invade contiguous sites; the lungs are involved in about 15% of cases.
- • Treatment options include surgery and chemotherapy with anti-helminthic agents, and treatment is approached in a similar manner to patients with alveolar echinococcus (AE).
- • Patients typically present in the advanced stage of disease when surgical cure is no longer an option.

#### **INTRODUCTION**

Polycystic neotropical echinococcus (NE) occurs in tropical areas of Central and South America. It is an infection by the larval stage of *Echinococcus vogeli* and, less frequently, *E. oligarthrus.* The clinical picture of *E. vogeli* is complex and has many similarities to alveolar echinococcus (AE). If not recognized and treated, the disease is fatal[.1](#page-2-0) Humans become infected with *E. vogeli* after accidental ingestion of eggs passed in the feces of the definitive hosts, usually bush dogs[.2](#page-2-1)

Infection with the metacestode stage of *E. oligarthrus* causes unicystic NE, but this is rare; there have only been four cases reported[.1–4](#page-2-0) Genotyping helps differentiate *E. oligarthrus* from other *Echinococcus* spp.

### **EPIDEMIOLOGY**

Two hundred and forty-two cases of polycystic NE have been documented[.1](#page-2-0) The natural hosts of *E. vogeli* range throughout Central and South America, and as awareness and diagnostic capability increase, it is probable that more cases will be recorded[.5](#page-2-2) *E. oligarthrus* occurs from Costa Rica to the La Pampa region of Argentina[.1,2](#page-2-0) In view of the extreme diversity of habitats, very little is known about the respective transmission system.

#### **NATURAL HISTORY, PATHOGENESIS, AND PATHOLOGY**

The definitive host for *E. vogeli,* the agent of polycystic NE, is the bush dog (*Speothos venaticus*); the intermediate host is the paca (*Cuniculus paca*), which are large rodents and the preferred prey of the bush dog.[1,2,6,7](#page-2-0) Humans acquire polycystic NE when they ingest tapeworm eggs, with subsequent invasion of tissue by the metacestode stage[.6,8](#page-2-3) The larval tissue stage also occurs occasionally in rodents of other species, including the agouti (*Dasyprocta* spp.) and spiny rat (*Proechimys* spp.). The paca is widely hunted for food in the northern region of South America.

The definitive hosts of *E. oligarthrus* are felids, including jaguar, puma, jaguarondi, ocelot, pampas cat, Geoffroy's cat, and bobcat; intermediate hosts are similar to *E. vogeli*. [2,9](#page-2-1) The mode of transmission to humans is unknown. Differentiation of *E. vogeli* and *E. oligarthrus* is made by the length and proportions of the rostellar hooks[.1,6,10](#page-2-0) The remote behavior of the definitive hosts presumably limits human exposure.

### **CLINICAL FEATURES**

Of the two neotropical species, *E. vogeli* is clinically more severe. Patients are typically diagnosed between 40 and 60 years of age, which may reflect a long, silent latent period.[1,11,12](#page-2-0) The disease is more common in men. The liver is the most common organ affected (approximately 80%), followed by the lungs and peritoneal cavity.[1](#page-2-0) Infection by *E. vogeli* is chronic, and patients typically present with advanced disease; extensive disease has not been described in individuals younger than 22 years of age. The most common presentation of polycystic NE is upper abdominal pain with fever; weight loss or jaundice; and signs of hepatomegaly, palpable peritoneal masses, and anemia. Portal hypertension and obstruction of the biliary ducts are frequent and can occur in up to 25% of patients.[2](#page-2-1) Patients with more advanced disease can present in a similar manner to those patients with hepatic cirrhosis.[3,5](#page-2-4) Cough and hemoptysis can be seen in lung involvement.

The four known cases of *E. oligarthrus* infection have involved the eyes and the heart. In contrast to *E. vogeli, E. oligarthrus* infections present as a single lesion, which tends to be small (15–30 mm in diameter). If multiple cysts are found, they have been in separate locations[.1](#page-2-0)

At laparotomy, polycystic NE from *E. vogeli* is a whitish-gray polycystic structure that contains a yellow fluid or gel [\(Fig. 134.1A](#page-1-0)). It can extend into the liver parenchyma and sometimes along the bile ducts. Cysts range from 10 mm in diameter or to vesicular aggregates that replace most of the liver.

Metacestodes multiply asexually by endogenous and exogenous proliferations, invade organs, and then metastasize.[1](#page-2-0) Growth resembles that described for *E. multilocularis*. Numerous vesicles are apparent that vary in size from a few millimeters to centimeters. They are partitioned by septa formed from the hyaline laminated membrane, which is 8 to 65 µm thick and stains intensely by periodic acid–Schiff ([Fig. 134.1B](#page-1-0)). The internal surface of the septa is lined with a germinal membrane that is 3 to 13 µm thick and contains calcareous corpuscles. Brood capsules bud internally from the germinal epithelium. The protoscolex with its four circular suckers and rostellum with hooks can be seen in wet mount preparations and tissue sections[.10](#page-2-5) Externally, the cyst is surrounded by fibrous tissue, with only slight cellular infiltration. Portions of these cysts are frequently necrotic and mineralized, and the only remains of the metacestode are the hooks and calcareous corpuscles.

## <span id="page-1-0"></span>**PATIENT EVALUATION, DIAGNOSIS, AND DIFFERENTIAL DIAGNOSIS**

The diagnosis of polycystic NE is based on patient history, physical examination, imaging studies, and laboratory tests (parasitologic, histopathologic, and molecular). Patients should be asked about travel, immigration, hunting pacas, and other activities that bring individuals into contact with bush dogs and domestic dogs. The diagnosis should be considered in patients who present with abdominal masses and who reside or previously resided in rural Central or South American regions.

Abdominal ultrasound (US) shows single or multiple round, anechoic cysts with thin walls; several liver segments may be involved[.1](#page-2-0) A plain radiograph showing polycystic masses with small calcifications is suggestive of polycystic NE. Abdominal computed tomography (CT) scan reveals multiple, round, and hypodense structures of varying sizes.[3](#page-2-4) A key diagnostic feature of polycystic NE is peripheral calcification of the cysts, which occurs in 96% of cases.[1](#page-2-0) US and CT can be used to monitor response to treatment.[1](#page-2-0)

Serology is supportive and should be interpreted with the epidemiologic data and clinical and radiographic findings. *E. vogeli* and *E. oligarthrus* are much less studied in antigenic composition than *E. granulosus* and *E. multilocularis.* In most polycystic NE cases the antigen used for serodiagnosis has been from hydatid fluid from *E. granulosus,* with the exception of an *E. vogeli* antigen named Ev2[.13,14](#page-2-6) It can differentiate antibody responses between *E. vogeli* and *E. granulosus* patients but not between *E. vogeli* and *E. multilocularis* patients[.14](#page-2-7) Polymerase chain reaction followed by genetic sequencing is currently the best technique to confirm the species.[15](#page-2-8)

Diagnostic aspiration of a cystic lesion should be performed with caution, and administration of a benzimidazole (albendazole) should accompany this procedure to avoid secondary spread of polycystic NE.[1](#page-2-0) Microscopic identification is based on protoscoleces and hook morphology[.1,10](#page-2-0)

#### **TREATMENT**

The principles of management of cystic echinococcosis and AE also apply to polycystic NE.[16](#page-2-9) Surgical resection is a good option for patients without advanced disease.[12](#page-2-10) For individuals with extensive lesions, surgical resection is difficult and usually incomplete. A combination of surgery with a benzimidazole (albendazole) is most likely to be successful. Siqueira et al. (2013) adapted the alveolar AE schema (PNM classification) for cases of polycystic NE[.17,18](#page-2-11) When deciding on therapy, this classification considers the appearance of the cyst in the liver, the invasion of neighboring organs, and metastasis to other organs. Although useful for hepatic disease, it is not applicable to disease only occurring in the peritoneal cavity. In patients with cysts disseminated in the peritoneal cavity, resection can be difficult, and they should be first treated with benzimidazoles (albendazole) and reevaluated at a later time for resection.[1,3](#page-2-0)

Of the benzimidazoles, albendazole is preferred over mebendazole due to its better bioavailability. The recommended albendazole dose is 10 to 15 mg/kg per day in two divided doses ingested with a high-fat meal/snack. If possible, albendazole sulfoxide levels should be monitored 4 hours after the morning dose. Side effects are transient abdominal discomfort when treatment is initiated, (reversible) hair loss, and, more importantly, toxic hepatitis and agranulocytosis, although the latter occurs very rarely. Liver function tests and a white blood cell count should be done at days 0, 5, 10, and 30 when albendazole is introduced, thereafter twice-weekly and increasingly stretched to monthly, every 3 months, and every 6 months if indicated.

Polycystic NE has a 5.2% mortality rate in patients treated surgically.[1](#page-2-0) The mortality rises to 15.5% when considering all cases of polycystic NE that are treated either surgically or medically[.17](#page-2-11) Pre- and post-operative benzimidazole therapy (albendazole) combined with surgery is considered the most effective treatment regimen when cyst resection is feasible[.1,12,17](#page-2-0) Therapy should be tailored based on risk and benefits and the stage at presentation, realizing there are few prospective data to guide management.
