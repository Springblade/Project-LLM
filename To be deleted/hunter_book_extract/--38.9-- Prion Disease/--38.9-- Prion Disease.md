# **38.9** Prion Disease

*Richard Knight*

#### KEY FEATURES

- • Prion diseases are also known as transmissible spongiform encephalopathies (TSEs).
- • They are rare, progressive, fatal, and untreatable encephalopathies of animals and man.
- • Creutzfeldt–Jakob disease (CJD) is the most common human disease.
- • Human prion diseases exist in idiopathic, genetic, and acquired forms.
- • Kuru, confined to Papua New Guinea, largely of historical interest, was transmitted by cannibalism.
- • The acquired forms have significant public health implications.
- • One disease, variant CJD, originated as a zoonotic infection via dietary contamination.
- • Variant CJD poses further risks via secondary transmission, particularly via blood and blood products.

#### **INTRODUCTION**

Transmissible spongiform encephalopathies (TSEs), or prion diseases, are a group of rare neurodegenerative encephalopathies affecting animals and humans ([Table 38.9.1](#page-0-0)). There is a common molecular pathology involving a post-translational conformational change in the prion protein and a potential transmissibility[.1,2](#page--1-0) Some human prion diseases are acquired as zoonotic or iatrogenic infections; others are genetic or idiopathic. They form part of the differential diagnosis of subacute brain disease and rapidly progressive dementia. The relevant agent (termed *the prion*) is incompletely characterized but is thought to represent a new class of infective agent consisting mostly or entirely of protein, without constituent DNA or RNA.[1,2](#page--1-0)

## **EPIDEMIOLOGY**

The overall annual mortality rate for human prion diseases is around 1 to 2 per million in countries where it has been studied[.3](#page--1-1)

Sporadic CJD (sCJD) is the most common prion disease, accounting for 80% to 85% of cases with a worldwide distribution. It is predominantly a disease of middle and late life ([Fig. 38.9.1](#page-1-0)). A sporadically occurring disease named *variably protease sensitive prionopathy,* with a varying clinical phenotype but relatively distinct neuropathological/molecular characteristics, has been described[.4](#page--1-2) It is of uncertain nosologic status, but is probably best considered an atypical form of sCJD.

Genetic prion disease (gPD) comprises three clinicopathologic phenotypes (discussed later), all resulting from pathogenic mutations of PRNP. They account for 10% to 15% of prion disease cases and are found in many countries, but have particularly high incidence foci in Slovakia and Israel (relating to the *E200K* mutation).[5](#page--1-3)

Acquired prion disease (iatrogenic and variant CJD—iCJD and vCJD, respectively) accounts for only a small percentage of cases;

<span id="page-1-1"></span>\*Case numbers for hGH and DM-related CJD may be inaccurate, as there is no organized collection of data. Total figures here from Bonda et al. 2016[.6](#page--1-4)

their details are summarized in [Table 38.9.2](#page-1-2). Iatrogenic transmission has been reviewed by Bonda et al[.6](#page--1-4) Variant CJD arose from bovine spongiform encephalopathy (BSE) contamination of human food (with an estimated dietary exposure risk period of 1980–1996 in the UK) but secondary, human-to-human, transmission has been reported via blood and blood products.[7](#page--1-5) Most cases have occurred in the UK and France but other countries have been affected. There are risk categorizations of countries for BSE by the World Organisation for Animal Health (also known as OIE; [www.oie.int.](http://www.oie.int/)) Clinical cases of vCJD have been in steady decline since 2000, with no known living cases in the world in 2017. However, public health concern remains because of the long incubation period and an estimated significant number of asymptomatic infected persons in the UK, who could be an infection risk to others,[8](#page--1-6) though the size of this risk has been questioned[.9](#page--1-7)

Variant CJD has had a relatively young age of illness onset compared with sporadic CJD (see [Fig. 38.9.1](#page-1-0)). Most iatrogenic CJD has arisen from cadaveric-derived human growth hormone (mostly in France, the UK, and United States) and dura mater grafts (mostly in Japan).[10](#page--1-8)

Kuru, geographically confined to certain areas of Papua New Guinea, is of largely historical importance, being transmitted from human to human via exposure during ritual mourning cannibalistic feasts (now discontinued). It was once the most common cause of death in adult females in that population. Very long incubation periods (of decades) have been described.

### **NATURAL HISTORY, PATHOGENESIS, AND PATHOLOGY**

Prion diseases are named after the prion protein, which plays a pivotal pathologic role. The precise role of normal prion protein (designated PrPC) is uncertain; it is a transmembrane glycoprotein, in humans encoded by *PRNP* (on chromosome 20). Prion diseases are characterized by a post-translational misfolding of PrPC and the disease-related conformation (designated PrPSc) aggregates and accumulates in tissue[.1,2](#page--1-0) The disease process is confined to the nervous system; a progressive neurodegenerative change involves neuronal loss, spongiform change, and gliosis. The precise relationship between the abnormal PrP accumulation and neuronal dysfunction is uncertain. In vCJD, PrPSc is found in significant amounts in lymphoreticular tissues even in pre-clinical stages. Relatively small amounts may be found outside the nervous system in the
