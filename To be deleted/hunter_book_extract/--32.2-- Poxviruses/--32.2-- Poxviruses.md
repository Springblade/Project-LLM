# **32.2** Poxviruses

*Catherine G. Sutcliffe, Anne W. Rimoin, William J. Moss*

## KEY FEATURES

- • Smallpox, caused by variola virus and historically the most important poxvirus of humans, was declared eradicated in 1980 after widespread vaccination with vaccinia virus.
- • Monkeypox:
  - • Zoonosis endemic in central and western Africa, clinically similar to smallpox, although lymphadenopathy is more prominent and the mortality rate lower.
  - • Transmitted by direct contact with infected animals or person to person via respiratory droplets.
  - • Prior vaccination with vaccinia virus (smallpox vaccine) results in milder disease and significantly lower mortality.
- • Other important poxvirus diseases include:
  - • Molluscum contagiosum—small, umbilicated papules on the face, trunk, or extremities of children worldwide.
  - • Orf—a zoonotic infection acquired from goats and sheep that manifests as papules, nodules, and pustules at the site of inoculation.

## **INTRODUCTION**

Poxviruses belong to the family Poxviridae. Those that infect humans are found among four genera (*Orthopoxvirus, Parapoxvirus, Molluscipoxvirus,* and *Yatapoxvirus*) within the Chordopoxvirinae subfamily ([Table 32.2.1\)](#page-0-1). Most poxvirus infections in humans are zoonoses, with only variola and molluscum contagiosum viruses being uniquely human pathogens. Poxviruses are large, generally brick-shaped virions containing double-stranded DNA that, in contrast to many other DNA viruses, replicate within the cytoplasm rather than in the nucleus of the host cell[.1](#page-5-0)

Variola virus is the etiologic agent of smallpox and was responsible for millions of deaths over thousands of years. The earliest archeological evidence dates to the 18th dynasty in ancient Egypt (1580–1350 BC). Large epidemics of smallpox occurred in most civilizations, with 10% to 30% of cases resulting in death. Smallpox was eradicated through an intensive global campaign based on vaccination with vaccinia virus, a related *Orthopoxvirus* thought to be derived from cowpox virus. Recent genetic analysis of vaccine virus from the early 20th century suggests an ancestral lineage linked to horsepox virus.[2](#page-5-1) The last endemic case of smallpox occurred in Somalia in 1977, and in 1980 the World Health Organization (WHO) officially declared smallpox eradicated.[3](#page-5-2)

More recently, concern has been raised about the use of variola virus as a biological weapon, resulting in increased interest in poxviruses. With more frequent global travel and the expansion of human populations into new habitats, the public health importance of zoonotic poxviruses and their potential to cause outbreaks

## **EPIDEMIOLOGY**

Monkeypox virus was first identified in captive monkeys at the State Serum Institute in Copenhagen in 1958, although they are not the natural viral reservoir. Monkeypox virus is endemic to tropical rainforests of central and western Africa, with most human cases occurring in the Democratic Republic of Congo (formerly Zaire) (Fig. [32.2.1\)](#page-1-0). However,reports of monkeypox have increased in neighboring Republic of Congo,[4](#page-5-3) and a cluster of cases was reported in 2005 to 2006 in Sudan for the first time.[5](#page-5-4) Toward the end of 2017 an outbreak of monkeypox in Nigeria caused a reported 269 suspected and 115 confirmed cases scattered throughout the country[.6](#page-5-5) In 2003 the first report of human monkeypox outside of the African continent occurred in the midwestern United States and was associated with imported African rodents.[7](#page-5-6)

Outbreaks typically occur in small villages where inhabitants are engaged in hunting and gathering[.8](#page-5-7) Humans contract monkeypox through direct contact with infected animals or humans. Most cases are contracted through direct contact with infected body fluids or lesions during hunting, skinning, killing, or cooking animal carcasses. Such mammals include the great apes (chimpanzees and orangutans), many species of monkey, domestic pigs, African hedgehogs, opossums, many species of squirrel, dormice, African porcupines, rats, jerboa, and shrews. The natural reservoir species is unknown; however, rope squirrels or other terrestrial rodents that inhabit the forests of central and western Africa are considered the most likely viral reservoirs[.8,9](#page-5-7)

The first documented human case of monkeypox was a child in the Democratic Republic of Congo in 1970, 2 years after the last case of smallpox had occurred in the area[.10](#page-5-8) After subsequent cases were recognized, the WHO began active surveillance in the Democratic Republic of Congo between 1981 and 1986 and identified a further 338 cases, with 28% attributed to secondary human-to-human transmission. The largest reported outbreak of monkeypox occurred in the Kasai Oriental region of the Democratic Republic of Congo during 1996 and 1997, although confusion with a concurrent varicella outbreak made precise estimates of the size of the outbreak difficult.[11](#page-5-9) With increased global travel and interest in exotic pets, the geographic range of monkeypox has expanded. In 2003 the first outbreak of monkeypox outside of Africa occurred in the midwestern United States, with 71 cases, of which 35 were laboratory-confirmed.[12](#page-5-10) Many cases had direct contact with infected pet prairie dogs. The outbreak was traced to imported giant Gambian rats from Ghana that were housed with prairie dogs. Despite this importation and the potential for monkeypox virus to infect a broad range of mammals, the virus does not appear to have established an endemic animal reservoir within the United States.[8,13](#page-5-7)

Person-to-person transmission of monkeypox virus accounts for 10% to 30% of cases[.11](#page-5-9) Transmission is through large respiratory droplets during prolonged face-to-face contact, although transmission through contact with infected fomites or aerosols may occur[.8](#page-5-7) Person-to-person transmission of monkeypox virus is less efficient than for variola virus, and the longest recorded human chain of transmission is six generations[.4](#page-5-3) Studies conducted in the 1980s suggested that household transmission from an index case occurred in 8% to 15% of contacts.[14](#page-5-11) These data were used to create a stochastic model for the spread of monkeypox between humans, which indicated that monkeypox virus was highly unlikely to sustain itself in human populations and therefore did not constitute a major public health problem[.15](#page-5-12) When these studies were conducted, most household members were vaccinated against smallpox, which provided cross-protective immunity to monkeypox infection. Today, most individuals are now unvaccinated. In an outbreak in the Democratic Republic of Congo in 2013, the proportion of household contacts infected with monkeypox ranged from 50% to 100%[,16](#page-5-13) suggesting an increased risk for human-to-human transmission.

In endemic regions, transmission of human monkeypox has been reported throughout the year with no peak month or season. Incidence is highest in individuals under the age of 15 years and is slightly higher in males than females in this age group. In 1981 serologic surveys were carried out in four countries in central and western Africa to determine the prevalence of *Orthopoxvirus* infection, including monkeypox virus infection[.17](#page-5-14) The prevalence of antibodies to *Orthopoxvirus* was 15.4% among people without a history of smallpox vaccination. Only 0.7% of people tested were seropositive for monkeypox virus, with seroprevalence highest among children aged 5 to 9 years. More recently, a study conducted in the Republic of Congo after an outbreak of monkeypox in 2003 found a seroprevalence of 57% for *Orthopoxvirus*, with some seropositivity likely attributable to prior smallpox vaccination[.18](#page-5-15) A 20-fold increase in the incidence of monkeypox was found in the Democratic Republic of Congo by active surveillance 30 years after cessation of smallpox, and unvaccinated individuals were at a 5.2-fold increased risk of monkeypox[.19](#page-5-16)

The age distribution of cases and the secondary attack rate for monkeypox have changed, most likely because of cessation of smallpox vaccination and waning immunity among vaccinated persons. In the 1970s and 1980s, most cases occurred among unvaccinated children younger than 5 years of age. Secondary cases tended to be older and were likely to be among mothers of infected children. As susceptibility to monkeypox increased, both the average age of infection and the proportion of secondary infections increased ([Table 32.2.2](#page-2-3)). In the Democratic Republic of Congo, the mean age of cases of monkeypox increased from 4.4 years during the period 1981 to 1986 to 15.4 years during the period 2001 to 2004.[20](#page-5-17)

Other poxviruses of humans include molluscum contagiosum, orf, and tanapox viruses (see [Table 32.2.1\)](#page-0-1). Molluscum contagiosum is the most common poxvirus infection of humans and causes umbilicated papules of 1 to 5 mm in size on the face, trunk, or extremities of children worldwide. Orf, the most common *Parapoxvirus* infection of humans, is a zoonotic infection acquired from goats and sheep manifesting as papules, nodules, and pustules at the site of inoculation. Tanapox virus, in the genus *Yatapoxvirus* and endemic in equatorial Africa, is transmitted by nonhuman primates via an arthropod vector or by direct contact, and results in a febrile illness with papulonodular skin lesions and lymphadenopathy.

## **NATURAL HISTORY AND PATHOGENESIS**

Monkeypox begins with infection of either the dermis (after transmission from infected animals) or the respiratory epithelium (after transmission from an infected person). The virus disseminates through the lymphatic system, resulting in primary viremia and systemic infection. A secondary viremia results in infection of the epithelium, producing skin and mucosal lesions. As a consequence of replication in mucosal surfaces the virus can be transmitted through oropharyngeal secretions to close contacts. The risk of transmission likely depends on the density of oropharyngeal lesions, the proximity and duration of contact, and virus survival, despite host immune responses. Monkeypox virus, like other poxviruses, has evolved mechanisms to evade host immune responses. Monkeypox virus is likely to be stable on fomites, and the number of virions required for infection is thought to be low based on potential similarities with variola virus. Strain differences may exist monkeypox strains circulating in western Africa appear to be more attenuated and less transmissible than those in the Congo basin[.21](#page-5-18)

The incubation period from exposure to the onset of clinical symptoms and signs is 10 to 14 days. Patients are infectious during the first week of rash and should be isolated[.13](#page-5-19) Most people infected with monkeypox virus are symptomatic, but sub-clinical infection can occur. Serologic studies of household contacts of acutely infected cases in the Democratic Republic of Congo suggest that approximately 28% of all monkeypox infections are sub-clinical. More recently, immunologic evidence of exposure to monkeypox virus was identified in several asymptomatic contacts of infected people in the United States[.22,23](#page-5-20)

HIV and other conditions that suppress cell-mediated immunity may alter the natural history of disease. No data exist for monkeypox, but other poxvirus infections, specifically vaccinia and molluscum contagiosum viruses, are more severe in those who are infected with HIV.

## **CLINICAL FEATURES**

The clinical features of monkeypox resemble those of smallpox (variola) [\(Table 32.2.3](#page-3-0)). Symptoms begin with a prodromal illness of fever and malaise lasting 1 to 3 days, followed by the characteristic rash. In contrast to smallpox, prominent sub-mandibular, cervical,

<span id="page-3-1"></span>post-auricular, axillary, or inguinal lymphadenopathy occurs in many infected persons 1 to 2 days before rash onset. Lymphadenopathy is not a typical feature of smallpox and can serve to clinically distinguish monkeypox from smallpox [\(Fig. 32.2.2](#page-3-1); see [Table 32.2.3\)](#page-3-0). As with smallpox, lesions develop concurrently and progress at a similar rate over 2 to 4 weeks, depending on the disease severity. The rash begins as small, 2- to 5-mm papules and progresses through vesicular, pustular, and crusted stages over 2 to 3 weeks ([Fig. 32.2.3](#page-3-2)). Like smallpox, it tends to be more severe on the head and extremities, including the palms and soles, and less intense on the trunk. The scabs slough off during recovery, leaving de-pigmented scars. Complications of monkeypox include

<span id="page-3-2"></span>secondary bacterial infection of the skin lesions, pneumonitis, and eye involvement. Death occurs during the second week of illness in approximately 10% of cases. Prior vaccination with vaccinia virus (smallpox vaccine) results in milder disease with fewer skin lesions, less lymphadenopathy, and significantly lower mortality.[24](#page-5-21)

## **PATIENT EVALUATION, DIAGNOSIS, AND DIFFERENTIAL DIAGNOSIS**

Poxvirus infection should be considered when evaluating a patient with a febrile illness and vesiculopustular rash, particularly when the patient resides in an area endemic for monkeypox virus (see [Fig. 32.2.1](#page-1-0)) or has contact with animals capable of transmitting poxviruses. A presumptive diagnosis of monkeypox can often be made clinically based on the characteristic rash and lymphadenopathy, although the skin lesions may be difficult to distinguish from chickenpox early in the course of illness (see [Table 32.2.3](#page-3-0)). Smallpox should be considered if bioterrorism is possible. Suspected cases of monkeypox should be reported to local health authorities.

Laboratory diagnosis is necessary to confirm the diagnosis of monkeypox and differentiate infection from other causes of vesiculopustular rash. The case definition developed by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) after the 2003 outbreak in the United States is shown in [Table 32.2.4](#page-4-8). Optimum clinical specimens for diagnostic testing include scabs or swabs of the base of vesicles applied to a microscope slide and air dried. Samples potentially infected with monkeypox virus should be handled in Biosafety Level 2 facilities. Monkeypox virus can be identified by cell culture or polymerase chain reaction (PCR)–based assays, and the Cepheid GeneXpert System has a PCR-based cartridge for field diagnosis. Serologic assays have insufficient sensitivity to reliably diagnose monkeypox infection.

From Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. Updated Interim Case Definition for Human Monkeypox, January 2004. Available at: [https://stacks.](https://stacks.cdc.gov/view/cdc/26098/cdc_26098_DS1.pdf) [cdc.gov/view/cdc/26098/cdc\\_26098\\_DS1.pdf](https://stacks.cdc.gov/view/cdc/26098/cdc_26098_DS1.pdf).

With the exception of smallpox, monkeypox is most commonly confused clinically with varicella (chickenpox) (see [Table 32.2.3](#page-3-0)), and coinfection with both viruses can occur.[25](#page-5-22) Varicella can be distinguished from monkeypox because the skin lesions of chickenpox are pleomorphic (in different stages of development), are concentrated on the trunk, and rarely involve the palms and soles. Lymphadenopathy does not occur in uncomplicated varicella, and the illness resolves in 2 weeks. Other causes of a vesiculopapular rash include drug eruptions, eczema herpeticum, dermatitis herpetiformis, rickettsialpox, and molluscum contagiosum.[11](#page-5-9)

## **PREVENTION AND TREATMENT**

Access to basic health care in remote forested areas of western and central sub-Saharan Africa can be difficult, and the prevention and treatment of monkeypox are severely limited in the absence of external assistance. Data from the Democratic Republic of Congo in the early 1980s suggested that pre-exposure smallpox vaccination provided approximately 85% protection against monkeypox[.26](#page-5-23) Prior smallpox vaccination, however, did not provide complete protection against monkeypox in the United States[.22](#page-5-20) No information is available on the efficacy of post-exposure vaccination with vaccinia virus, although extrapolation from postexposure vaccination for the prevention of smallpox suggests post-exposure vaccination may prevent monkeypox disease or reduce severity if given within 3 days of exposure. The CDC currently recommends routine smallpox vaccination of laboratory personnel who directly handle cultures or animals contaminated or infected with replication-competent *Orthopoxviruses*. The CDC also recommends that vaccination be offered to health care or animal care personnel who have contact with contaminated materials, provided they have no contraindications to vaccination. Post-exposure vaccination for those with an *Orthopoxvirus* exposure can be determined on a case-by-case basis in consultation with public health authorities.[27](#page-5-24)

Treatment of persons with monkeypox is supportive. Data are not available on the effectiveness of vaccinia immune globulin for the prevention or treatment of complications of monkeypox; however, the CDC recommends immune globulin be considered for prophylactic use in persons exposed to monkeypox virus with severe cellular immunodeficiency for whom smallpox vaccination is contraindicated.[28](#page-5-25) Cidofovir and brincidofocir (CMX001) have anti-monkeypox viral activity in vitro and in animal studies, with brincidofocir exhibiting greater potency and safety[.29](#page-5-26) Whether humans may benefit from either treatment is not known, but the CDC recommends that treatment with either antiviral be considered in persons with severe monkeypox.[28](#page-5-25) Tecovirimat (ST-246) has also been shown to be effective in treating *Orthopoxvirus*-induced disease in animal studies[,30](#page-5-27) but would need to be administered under an Investigational New Drug status.[28](#page-5-26)
