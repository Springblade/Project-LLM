### INTRODUCTION

Sparganosis is a rare parasitic disease caused by invasion of human tissue by plerocercoid tapeworm larvae (spargana) of the genus Spirometra. Adult tapeworms occur in domestic and wild carnivores and are similar to Diphyllobothrium (see Chapter 130). However, their life cycles differ, as *Spirometra* usually use amphibians, reptiles, and mammals as second intermediate hosts, whereas Diphyllobothrium use fish (Fig. 135.1).

#### **EPIDEMIOLOGY**

Humans are rare incidental hosts in sparganosis. The parasites are prevalent in cats, dogs, and wild carnivores in many parts of the world and are endemic in 48 countries. Human infections, especially among children and young adults, are most common in Southeast Asia; infections have been reported in individuals who travel from endemic to non-endemic areas in East Africa, South America, North America, Australia, and parts of Europe.<sup>2</sup> There are many species of Spirometra, including S. proliferum, S. decipiens, S. houghtoni, and S. folium. In Southeast Asia the parasite is referred to as S. mansoni, and in North America as S. mansonoides. On other continents, it may be called S. erinacei, S. europaei, S. theileri, and S. ranarum. <sup>4</sup> The highest endemicity of infection with Spirometra spp. is in Korea and Japan, primarily due to dietary customs such as consumption of undercooked or raw pork, frog, bullfrog, and snake.

## NATURAL HISTORY, PATHOGENESIS, AND PATHOLOGY

Humans acquire larvae of Spirometra spp. by (1) drinking contaminated water containing copepods (Cyclops) carrying the procercoid larvae; (2) ingesting the plerocercoid larvae in undercooked meat from second intermediate hosts such as carnivores, amphibians, reptiles, rodents, or other mammals; or (3) using those meats as a poultice (a traditional medicinal practice in which meats are applied directly to ulcers, sores, or inflamed eyes) (see Fig. 135.1). The latter is a cause of orbital sparganosis.<sup>5</sup>

After ingestion, the spargana migrate to subcutaneous tissues, the most frequent location, where they become encapsulated in inflammatory nodules that can develop into abscesses. As spargana can invade any tissue, it is possible to have these abscesses anywhere in the body, including the brain. 4 The sparganum remains viable inside the nodule, and thus the subcutaneous masses can migrate. 6,7 Spargana can live for up to 30 years inside their host, and their length can vary from a few millimeters to a few centimeters. It is rare for adult worms to develop.

### **CLINICAL FEATURES**

The most common clinical presentation is a migrating subcutaneous abscess that may involve localized pain, erythema, and pruritus. Other features depend on the location and size of the lesion.<sup>5</sup> In the subconjunctival tissues, the larvae provoke acute inflammation with painful conjunctivitis and periorbital edema. If the larvae invade the periorbital tissues, it may result in proptosis and blindness. Sparganosis can infect the central nervous system (CNS), breasts, lungs, liver, peritoneal cavity, epididymis, bone, bladder, heart, ear, kidneys, and muscle.8 In some locations, such as breasts, bones, genital organs, peritoneal cavity, and abdominal viscera, it can be mistaken for cancer.9

CNS infections usually have the worst prognosis. Although CNS involvement is rare, spargana have been reported to cause brain abscesses that can migrate, intradural spinal canal infection, and extradural spinal cord infection. In these cases, the mass can produce seizures (reported as the most common symptom), headaches, slowly evolving hemiparesis, paresthesias, memory loss, confusion, and radiculalgia. There is no evidence to suggest that immunosuppression influences the risk of CNS infection.

Pulmonary sparganosis might be apparent from intermittent bloody phlegm, migratory patches in the lungs, peripheral blood eosinophilia, fever, and consistent cough, which can be misdiagnosed as eosinophilic pneumonia or tumors. 10

On biopsy, the parasites can usually be extracted alive; they may be several centimeters in length. They are glistening white, opaque, ribbon-like worms with a typical undulating cestode movement (Fig. 135.2A and C). Grossly, the inflammation is nodular and locally fibrotic. On histology there is inflammation consisting of lymphocytes, histiocytes, plasma cells, neutrophils, calcospherules, 11 and multinucleated giant cells; eosinophils can be abundant or absent (Fig. 135.2B).

# PATIENT EVALUATION, DIAGNOSIS, AND DIFFERENTIAL DIAGNOSIS

In a patient with a subcutaneous infection of sparganosis, peripheral eosinophilia does not occur, and blood work will provide little help. However, peripheral eosinophilia can be pronounced in CNS infection. Enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) has shown

**Fig. 135.1** Life cycle of *Spirometra* spp. Ova from the adult worm are shed in the feces of the definitive hosts: cats and dogs. The eggs hatch in freshwater into coracidia, which are ingested by the first intermediate host, copepods of the genus *Cyclops,* and grow into the first larval stage, procercoid. Water containing the copepods is ingested by the second intermediate hosts, which include reptiles, amphibians, and mammals, where they grow into the plerocercoid larvae. Sparganum develops into an adult worm in the intestines of the definitive hosts.

Imaging can be helpful, especially for CNS infection. Ultrasonography in subcutaneous and musculoskeletal cases demonstrates serpiginous, cystic, tubular tracts with echogenicity that are not specific to sparganosis[.14](#page-3-11)

In CNS infection, on computed tomography (CT) scan there are multi-focal areas of low density within white matter, adjacent ventricular dilation, or irregular enhancing lesions. The most distinct features of sparganosis on CT scan are the small punctate calcifications caused by the calcareous corpuscles the worm leaves in its tract; these are observed more clearly on CT scan than on magnetic resonance imaging (MRI).

Further investigation of CNS infection using MRI has three characteristic features. The first is the tunnel sign, created by the undulating movement of the worm [\(Fig. 135.3A–C](#page-3-12)). It is a columnshaped or fusiform-shaped tunnel with a hollow appearance and a smooth, well-defined margin.[15](#page-3-13) A second characteristic finding is a ring or bead-shaped enhancement, representing inflammatory granuloma. A third sign is a change in the location and shape of the lesion on serial images as a result of migration[.16](#page-3-14) It is important to look for lesions of multiple ages in the same image, due to the long course of the disease.

Definitive diagnosis is provided by identification of the parasite in a tissue specimen. If the intact parasite is extracted, it can be recognized by its head with a characteristic deep invagination ([Fig. 135.2C and D\)](#page-2-0). Histology of the worm shows features of cestode larvae ([Fig. 135.2D\)](#page-2-0). The surface tegument has multiple infoldings, or pseudo-segmentation. The worm-like appearance and the solid body of the spargana, along with the absence of suckers and hooks, usually distinguish them from the cystic stages of other cestodes that occur in subcutaneous tissues. Within the body of the worm, there are longitudinal muscle fibers, excretory channels, and calcareous corpuscles [\(Fig. 135.4\)](#page-3-15).[17](#page-3-16)

Differential diagnosis of parasite-induced cerebral mass lesions includes *Toxoplasma;* infection with larvae of other cestodes such as *Coenurus, Echinococcus,* and *Multiceps;* and cysticercosis, paragonimiasis, schistosomiasis, tuberculoma, and inflammatory granulomas[.18](#page-3-17) Gnathostomiasis, paragonimiasis, and infection from *Loa loa* filarial nematodes can cause migratory subcutaneous masses. Sparganosis should be considered in a rectal, sub-mucosal, tumorlike lesion[.11](#page-3-8) Ocular sparganosis should be differentiated from orbital cellulitis, acute uveitis, and hordeolum. Myxoid liposarcoma, cystic metastatic tumors, and angiomyolipoma are included as differential diagnosis in hepatic sparganosis.[8](#page-3-5)

# **TREATMENT**

The most effective treatment is complete surgical removal of the intact worm and the surrounding granuloma and stereotactic surgery for cerebral sparganosis[.19](#page-3-18) In patients with many infections, supplementary treatment with praziquantel and dexamethasone with a repeated course of therapy may be advisable, but there is

# *SPARGANUM PROLIFERUM*

*Sparganum proliferum* is a rare aberrant species of cestode found in the skin, muscles, viscera, and brain of humans. These larvae are cylindrical or slightly flattened and can be up to 20 cm long and 2 mm wide; they are distinguished by the ability to bud and branch. They have been reported only in the Far East and the Americas. Surgery is ineffective treatment for this disease due to its proliferative nature. There remains no effective treatment for this infection.
