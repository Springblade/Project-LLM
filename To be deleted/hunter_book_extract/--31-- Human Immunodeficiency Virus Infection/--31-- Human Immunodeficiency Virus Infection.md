# KEY FEATURES

- • Unprotected sexual contact is the predominant mode of HIV transmission globally.
- • The prevalence of HIV infections varies dramatically with a disproportionate number of infections in sub-Saharan Africa.
- • As CD4 cell counts decline, persons living with HIV are more susceptible to opportunistic infections and co-infections, such as cryptoccocal meningitis and pneumocystis pneumonia.
- • Guidelines now recommend HIV treatment as early as possible and with simplified formulations, more tolerable and durable medications, and antiretrovirals that target new steps in the viruses life cycle, improved treatment options exist.
- • In higher-income settings, protease inhibitors (particularly atazanavir and darunavir), and the integrase inhibitor, raltegravir, are preferred for pregnant women over non-nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitors.
- • With the dramatic scale-up of antiretroviral therapy (ART) over the last decade, 19.5 million patients were receiving ART globally in 2016 and as a result, AIDSrelated deaths declined 45% since 2005.
- • As the uptake of antiretroviral therapy increases in low- and middle-income countries, survival of HIVinfected persons will improve probably to the same extent as currently noted in high-income countries. As a results, AIDS-related opportunistic illnesses will decline and noncommunicable diseases in people with HIV will become increasingly prevalent.
- • HIV testing is an important component of primary HIV prevention. Thirty percent of all people living with HIV worldwide are unaware of their status; therefore, offering opt-out HIV testing in most clinical settings has been widely recommended.
- • In countries with high HIV prevalence, violence against women is common, and studies have shown that women who experience violence, sexual or physical, are at higher risk of acquiring HIV.
- • Interventions that help people with HIV maintain their health and reduce their risk of transmitting, often termed prevention with positives, play a critical role in HIV prevention.

#### **INTRODUCTION**

In 2016 the Joint United Nations Programme on HIV/AIDS (UNAIDS) estimated that 36.7 million persons were living with HIV infection by the end of 2015. Since the late 1990s, the global annual number of new infections has steadily declined ([Fig. 31.1](#page-1-0))[,1](#page-22-0) though in 2016, an estimated 1.8 million new infections occurred worldwide. The last decade has seen a dramatic scale-up of antiretroviral therapy (ART); in 2016 19.5 million patients were receiving ART globally compared with approximately 2.2 million a decade earlier[.2](#page-22-1) As a result AIDS-related deaths have fallen by 45% since the peak in 2005 [\(Fig. 31.2](#page-1-1))[.1](#page-22-0)

The first cases of AIDS were recognized in the United States in 1981.[3](#page-22-2) Phylogenetic analysis of HIV sequences suggests that HIV originated in Central Africa and may have been transmitted to humans around 1930[.4](#page-22-3) By 1985, HIV infection had been identified in every region of the world.[5](#page-22-4)

The peak of the HIV epidemic in some sub-Saharan African countries resulted in a reduction of life expectancy by more than 20 years, slowed economic growth, and worsened household poverty[.6](#page-22-5) However, massive international efforts to provide HIV treatment in low- and middle-income countries have contributed to the fastest global increase in life expectancy since the 1960s, with the greatest increase found in the World Health Organization (WHO) African Region from 2000 to 2015[.7](#page-22-6) Particular progress has been made in the prevention of mother-to-child transmission (PMTCT) of HIV; in 2015, almost 8 out of 10 pregnant women living with HIV received antiretroviral drugs to prevent the transmission of the virus to their children. In 2015 Cuba was the first country declared by WHO as having eliminated mother-tochild transmission of HIV and syphilis; the same was confirmed for Armenia, Belarus, Moldova, and Thailand in June 2016[.8](#page-22-7) Despite the remarkably rapid progress in ART expansion and scientific advances in basic science and treatment, declines in new HIV infections in adults have slowed dramatically. Thus the HIV pandemic continues to represent one of the world's most urgent public health challenges[.1](#page-22-0)

Global efforts to affect the HIV epidemic have been dedicated to strengthening health systems and workforce capacity and integrating HIV programs into general health systems. However, inpatient facilities still face numerous challenges in decreasing mortality from HIV.[9,10](#page-22-8) As a result of the immunosuppression caused by HIV infection, susceptibility to and severity of other infectious diseases are increased. HIV-infected patients can exhibit atypical clinical presentations of infections[,11](#page-22-9) and immunosuppressed HIV-infected patients can have multiple pathologic processes occurring simultaneously.

The HIV pandemic has also heightened the global consciousness to health disparities, social justice and human rights; and mobilized unprecedented political, financial and human resources to scale up HIV prevention, care, and treatment programs in the most affected countries[.12–14](#page-22-10)

#### **MOLECULAR EPIDEMIOLOGY**

There are two main types of HIV (a lentivirus): HIV-1 and HIV-2. HIV-1 comprises four phylogenetically distinct groups, termed group M (main), group O (outlier), group N (non-M, non-O), and group P, a genetically unique HIV strain described in two persons of Cameroonian origin.[15–18](#page-22-11) HIV-1 likely evolved from independent cross-species transmissions of chimpanzee simian immunodeficiency virus (SIV) to human[s19,20](#page-22-12) in the case of groups M and N and from gorilla SIV for groups O and P[17,21](#page-22-13) ([Fig. 31.3\)](#page-2-0). HIV-1 group M has spread to every region of the world and is the virus responsible for the current global pandemic[.22](#page-22-14) Group O infections are uncommon and limited to people living in, or epidemiologically linked to, Central Africa (especially Cameroon).[23](#page-23-0) Group N and P infections have been described rarely and only in Cameroon.[17,24](#page-22-13)

<span id="page-2-0"></span>**Fig. 31.3** Origins of human AIDS viruses. Old World monkeys are naturally infected with more than 40 different lentiviruses, termed simian immunodeficiency viruses (SIVs) with a suffix to denote their primate species of origin (e.g., SIVsmm from sooty mangabeys). Several of these SIVs have crossed the species barrier to great apes and humans, generating new pathogens. Known examples of cross-species transmissions, as well as the resulting viruses, are highlighted in red. (From Sharp P, Hahn B. Origins of HIV and the AIDS Pandemic. Cold Spring Harb Perspect Med 2011;1:1–22.)

HIV-2 is a primate lentivirus related to HIV-1 that is less pathogenic and less transmissible.[25](#page-23-1) HIV-2 evolved from the cross-species transmission of sooty mangabey SIV to humans.[20,26,27](#page-22-15) Although HIV-2 infections have been reported throughout the world, they are most prevalent in Guinea-Bissau[28,29](#page-23-2) and in surrounding West African countries[.21](#page-22-16) Recent data suggest the prevalence of HIV-2 in Guinea-Bissau has declined to less than 5%[.28–30](#page-23-2) Dual infection with HIV-1 and HIV-2 has been described, but the two viruses do not appear to recombine with each other[.31](#page-23-3)

High rates of viral replication coupled with continuous mutation and recombination events have resulted in the rapid genetic diversification of HIV-1 group M viruses into nine distinct subtypes (or clades) and at least 88 circulating recombinant forms (CRFs)[.32](#page-23-4) The number of recombinant viruses suggests that co-infection with divergent HIV-1 strains may occur more frequently than has been documented to date.[33](#page-23-5) HIV diversity likely has potential impact on pathogenesis, viral fitness, transmission dynamics, and magnitude of viremia[.34](#page-23-6)

HIV-1 group M viruses likely occurred in Central Africa, where the greatest diversity and earliest cases of HIV-1 have been identified.[33,35](#page-23-5) Subsequently, HIV-1 subtypes have spread with a geographically heterogeneous distribution [\(Fig. 31.4](#page-3-0))[.22](#page-22-14) Subtype C causes nearly half (48%) of HIV infections worldwide[.22](#page-22-14) The predominance of subtype C, especially in countries with high HIV prevalence where the epidemics are driven by heterosexual sexual contact, has led to speculation that subtype C might have an increased fitness for transmission[.36,37](#page-23-7) Subtype A accounts for 12% of infections worldwide and has a broad geographic distribution. CRF01\_AE and CRF02\_AG are two additional recombinant viruses involving subtype A that are epidemiologically important in Southeast Asia and West Africa, respectively[.22](#page-22-14) The emergence of these CRFs has raised concerns that recombination may contribute to the selection of viruses with increased fitness, immune escape, or transmissibility.[38](#page-23-8) Subtype B predominates in the Americas, western and central Europe, and Australia.

#### **MODES OF TRANSMISSION**

HIV can be transmitted by sexual contact; through exposure to infected blood, blood products, bodily fluids, or human tissues; and from mother to child ([Table 31.1\)](#page-3-1)[.39–41](#page-23-9) Although HIV has been isolated from a variety of body fluids, only blood, semen, genital fluids, and breast milk have been proven as sources of infection. HIV is not transmitted though routine household contact or provision of medical care when universal precautions[†](#page-2-1) are followed. Among all modes of transmission, a higher level of viremia in the source individual is associated with a higher transmission risk. Patients with viral suppression on ART rarely transmit through sexual contact.[41,42](#page-23-10)

Unprotected sexual contact is the predominant mode of HIV transmission globally[.1](#page-22-0) There is a relatively low efficiency of transmission per sexual act, and risk of infection varies significantly by type of sexual exposure[.41](#page-23-10) Numerous factors increase transmission, including mucosal microtrauma, bleeding, concurrent sexually transmitted infections (STIs), and HIV viral load[.43](#page-23-11) Concurrent sexual partners, and not simply the absolute number of partners, augment HIV's spread in a community.[44](#page-23-12) Male circumcision reduces female-to-male transmission of HIV by 60%[.45–47](#page-23-13) Studies have not demonstrated reduced male-to-female transmission in women whose HIV-infected partners undergo circumcision[.48](#page-23-14) Certain genetic factors also decrease the probability of HIV transmission ([Box 31.1\)](#page-3-2)[.49](#page-23-15)

Among people who inject drugs, HIV is transmitted by exposure to HIV-infected blood through shared contaminated needles and other injection equipment.[1,50](#page-22-0) Nosocomial transmission in hospitals from reuse of syringes and needles has been documented[,51–53](#page-23-16) and the risk of acquiring HIV from a transfusion with HIV-contaminated blood products approaches 100%.[54](#page-23-17)

<span id="page-2-1"></span><sup>&</sup>quot;Universal precautions," as defined by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), are a set of precautions designed to prevent transmission of bloodborne pathogens, such as HIV, when providing first aid or health care.

Mother-to-child transmission can occur during pregnancy, labor and delivery, and during breastfeeding. In non-breastfeeding populations, the majority of transmissions occur during the short interval before delivery when the placenta separates from the uterine wall and labor occurs. An additional 30% of transmissions occur during late labor and the actual passage through the birth canal. In breastfeeding populations, approximately 40% of transmissions occur in the postnatal breastfeeding period, and this contributes to the majority of new pediatric infection in resource-limited settings.[55](#page-23-18) Overall rates of transmission are 25% to 40% but can be reduced to <1% with provision of maternal antiretroviral therapy and subsequent virologic suppression during pregnancy, labor and delivery, and during breastfeeding (see "Prevention")[.40,56](#page-23-19)

#### **GEOGRAPHIC EPIDEMIOLOGY**

The prevalence of HIV infections varies dramatically with a disproportionate number of infections in sub-Saharan Africa [\(Fig.](#page-4-0) [31.5](#page-4-0)). Globally, new HIV infections have stabilized between 2010 and 2015; however, declines have been noted in sub-Saharan Africa[.1](#page-22-0) In several high-prevalence countries, the rates of HIV infection among young women attending antenatal clinics (a sentinel population) has declined[.1](#page-22-0) Improvements in surveillance, which include expanding sentinel surveillance sites to antenatal clinics in rural areas and conducting population-based surveys, can make trends difficult to interpret.

For the purposes of surveillance, UNAIDS and the WHO classify HIV epidemics as generalized, concentrated, or low level.[57](#page-23-20) Generalized epidemics are defined by an HIV prevalence consistently over 1% in pregnant women, a sentinel population used to assess trends in HIV prevalence and to estimate the adult HIV prevalence,[‡](#page-4-1) indicating that the sexual network in the general population is sufficient to sustain an epidemic independent of high-risk groups. Concentrated epidemics are defined by an HIV prevalence consistently over 5% in at least one defined high-risk group (i.e., men who have sex with men) and an HIV prevalence below 1% in pregnant women in urban areas indicating that HIV infection is not well established in the general population. Low-level epidemics are defined by an HIV prevalence that has not exceeded 5% in any defined high-risk group.

## Sub-Saharan Africa

HIV is a generalized epidemic in many parts of sub-Saharan Africa, which contains 69% of all infections worldwide but only 12.5% of the world's total population.[1,58](#page-22-0) Southern Africa now has the highest adult HIV prevalence in the world, followed by East Africa. Most countries in West and Central Africa have maintained a relatively low HIV prevalence.

HIV was recognized late in South Africa (South Africa had an HIV prevalence of less than 1% in 1988) but spread rapidly [\(Fig.](#page-5-0) [31.6](#page-5-0)). Swaziland now has the highest prevalence in the world, with an estimated one in four (26%) adults living with HIV infection in 2009 to 2015[.1](#page-22-0) The nine countries with the highest adult HIV prevalence worldwide (with an HIV prevalence greater than 10%) are all located in southern Africa. Various social and biologic factors have played a role in the high prevalence rates. These include high rates of men migrating for work, concurrent sexual partnerships, genital herpes, and gender-based inequalities[.59](#page-23-21)

Denial of risk remains a barrier. In a 2005 South African survey, half of people who tested HIV positive believed they were not at risk of acquiring infection[.60](#page-23-22) Only recently has the burden of HIV infections among men who have sex with me[n61–65](#page-23-23) and people who inject drug[s66](#page-23-24) in sub-Saharan Africa begun to be appreciated. The contribution to new infections by men who have sex with men is estimated to be greater than that by injection drug users (IDUs) because many men who have sex with men also have sex with women, whereas injection drug use is a new, and smaller, phenomenon that provides fewer opportunities for bridging transmissions.[66,67](#page-23-24)

#### Asia and the Pacific

Although the adult HIV prevalence is lower in Asia ([Fig. 31.7](#page-5-1)) than in sub-Saharan Africa, there were still an estimated 5.1 million people living with HIV in 2016, with an estimated 270,000 new infections and 170,000 AIDS-related deaths in 2016.[1](#page-22-0) In the Asia region, HIV prevalence is highest in Southeast Asia, where commercial sex work, sex between men, and injection drug use are

the primary modes of transmission. HIV in the region is concentrated in high-risk groups, and in many countries there are significant regional variations in their HIV prevalence.

In Thailand, increased knowledge of HIV and changes in sexual behavior (e.g., increased condom usage) have correlated with reductions in HIV prevalence among new military conscripts. Thailand's "100% Condom" campaign, which educated sex workers and promoted condom use, has also decreased HIV transmission from female commercial sex workers. 69

#### Latin America

In 2016 there were 1.8 million people living with HIV in Latin America, largely from Brazil.¹ Brazil's sustained campaign to promote sex education, condom use, harm reduction, and HIV testing and to provide universal ART has held adult prevalence below 1%.¹ The majority of HIV infections in South America occur among men who have sex with men<sup>70</sup> and IDUs.<sup>66</sup> Incarcerated men are at particularly high risk.<sup>71</sup> In addition, in Central America, a high proportion of men who have sex with men (22%) have reported having sex with at least one female partner in the previous 6 months, underscoring the potential for a bridge population to women in this region.<sup>72</sup>

# NATURAL HISTORY, PATHOGENESIS, AND PATHOLOGY

The HIV-1 genome is organized into three major regions: *gag*, encoding structural proteins; *pol*, encoding enzymes (e.g., reverse transcriptase, protease, and integrase) necessary for viral replication; and *env*, encoding envelope proteins (Fig. 31.8).<sup>73</sup> In addition, the HIV genome contains six regulatory genes (*tat*, *rev*, *nef*, *vpr*, *vpu*, and *vif*) that facilitate viral replication and host immune evasion. HIV is spherical with a diameter of 1/10,000 of a millimeter (Fig. 31.9).<sup>74</sup> The outer coat, known as the *viral envelope*, is composed of two lipid layers taken from the membrane of a human cell when a newly formed virus particle buds. Within the inner viral protein core are two copies of positive, single-stranded RNA that are tightly bound to nucleocapsid proteins and viral enzymes necessary for replication.

The HIV life cycle consists of seven stages (Fig. 31.10). HIV infects and replicates in cells that express the CD4 receptor, in particular CD4 T lymphocytes. HIV's envelope protein (gp120) binds (Step 1) to the CD4 receptor and to additional co-receptors (i.e., CCR5 or CXCR4), leading to viral fusion (Step 2) with the cell and entry of HIV's inner viral core and release of HIV RNA and HIV enzymes such as reverse transcriptase and integrase. HIV's reverse transcriptase then converts the single-stranded HIV RNA genome into double-stranded DNA (Step 3). Reverse transcriptase is error prone, and it is at this step that mutations

<span id="page-6-1"></span>and strand recombinations generate genetically distinct viral variants. The viral DNA then complexes with HIV integrase, is transported into the host cell's nucleus, and is integrated with the help of host DNA repair enzymes into a transcriptionally active location in the host's chromosomal DNA (Step 4). <sup>74,75</sup> This step irreversibly transforms the cell into a producer of virus. Both host and viral factors stimulate transcription of viral RNA from the integrated DNA. This new viral RNA is translated into viral proteins (Step 5), and these materials move to the cell membrane and new, immature HIV virions form and bud off from the cell with the help of host proteins (Step 6). Once released, the HIV virion matures when HIV protease enzyme cleaves the gag-pol polyprotein into smaller functional proteins (Step 7). Several host proteins interact with HIV proteins or DNA to either restrict or promote virus replication in specific cell types. <sup>75</sup>

A certain proportion of cells infected by HIV are resting memory T lymphocytes, which provide the virus with a persistent, long-lived reservoir that currently available antivirals are unable to eliminate. This latent viral reservoir is considered the primary obstacle to the development of an HIV cure, defined as drug-free remission. <sup>76,77</sup> To date, research into interventions for cure has primarily focused on the use of latency-reversing agents to induce HIV gene

Primary infection characterized by high plasma viremia (solid dark blue line, top), low CD4 cells (solid light blue line, bottom), and absence of HIV-1– specific antibodies (light gray dashed line, bottom). Viremia drops as cytotoxic CD8<sup>+</sup> T lymphocytes (CTL) develop (black dashed line, bottom) and an individual viral load set-point is reached during chronic infection. Viral set-points differ greatly among individuals (e.g., top) and predict disease progression. Viral diversity increases throughout the disease (closed circles, top). The risk of transmission is highest in the first weeks when viremia peaks (closed circles, top). *GALT*, Gut-associated lymphoid tissues. (From Simon V, Ho DD, Abdool Karim Q.

expression in these resting cells in the presence of active antiretroviral agents and HIV-specific immune responses resulting in the death of infected cells ("kick and kill") and eventual elimination of the reservoir.[76,77](#page-24-3)

HIV transmission is inefficient, and many HIV exposures do not result in HIV infection [\(Table 31.1\)](#page-3-1). Successful HIV transmission occurs when HIV is able to cross the host's mucosal barrier and infect CD4 T lymphocytes, macrophages, and dendritic cells. At this early stage, HIV must avoid host defenses that could extinguish the infection while recruiting target cells, specifically CD4 T lymphocytes, to the site of infection. These initially infected cells return to regional lymph nodes where HIV is able to amplify by infecting other CD4 T lymphocytes. When these infected lymphocytes migrate into the bloodstream, HIV is dispersed throughout the body and causes massive infection of susceptible CD4 T lymphocytes in the gastrointestinal tract, lymph system, spleen, and bone marrow. Up to 60% of memory CD4 T lymphocytes in the gut-associated lymphoid tissue are infected and killed within weeks of infection.[78–80](#page-24-4) This infection corresponds to a peak in HIV plasma viremia and the appearance of clinical symptoms of acute HIV infection [\(Fig. 31.11](#page-8-0)).

In response, the host generates both a humoral and cellular adaptive immune response and HIV viremia declines. This decline results primarily from the immune response (particularly the development of cytotoxic CD8<sup>+</sup> T lymphocytes against HIV) but also, to a lesser degree, from the depletion of available target cells. Within 6 months, an individual's viral load will reach a set-point. This HIV viral load set-point varies greatly among individuals[.81](#page-24-5) Determinants of viral set-point include host factors (see [Box 31.1](#page-3-2)), viral genome factors[,82](#page-24-6) and source partner HIV-1 RNA levels.[83](#page-24-7) A higher level of chronic viremia (viral set-point) predicts more rapid disease progression[.84,85](#page-24-8) Many individuals will be asymptomatic for years, although they remain infectious as this stage of HIV infection is characterized by ongoing viral replication. The half-life of an individual HIV virion is short—the entire plasma viral population is replaced every 30 minutes[.86](#page-24-9) To keep pace, T-lymphocyte proliferation is greatly upregulated. However, over time, there is a gradual destruction of naïve and memory CD4 T lymphocytes. The rate of CD4 decline is variable.[87,88](#page-24-10) The median rate of CD4 decline has ranged from 37 to 74 cells/µL/year in studies from Africa[89,90](#page-24-11) Recent modeling suggests a faster rate of decline in Asian cohorts.[91](#page-24-12)

#### **MANIFESTATIONS AND MANAGEMENT OF HIV INFECTION AND COMPLICATIONS OF HIV**

As the CD4 cell count declines, an HIV-infected person's susceptibility to infections and infection-related malignancies normally controlled by the cell-mediated immune system increases. This susceptibility is greatest when the CD4 cell count declines below 200 cells/µL. In high-income countries, the term *AIDS* describes the most advanced stage of HIV infection, characterized by severe immunodeficiency (e.g., CD4 cell count <200 cells/µL in the United States) and development of opportunistic illnesses. In addition, HIV causes chronic inflammation and has direct effects on a variety of organs. Disease progression in the absence of ART varies with characteristics of the infecting virus, the host immune response, and other factors. In general, disease progression is more rapid in children and older adults. Among infants, acquisition of HIV in utero predicts more rapid disease progression in the absence of treatment[.92](#page-24-13)

### **Acute HIV Infection**

Acute HIV infection is the earliest stage of disease before anti-HIV antibodies are detectable[.93](#page-24-14) An estimated 40% to 90% of persons experience symptoms during acute HIV infection[.94](#page-24-15) Acute HIV often presents as an infectious mononucleosis-like or influenza-like syndrome, but the clinical features can be highly variable. Symptoms typically begin a median of 10 days after HIV acquisition [\(Box](#page-9-0) [31.2](#page-9-0)) and include fever, maculopapular rash, myalgia, lymphadenopathy, oral sores, and pharyngitis[.95](#page-24-16) The presence of fever

and rash has the best positive predictive value[.96](#page-24-17) Unfortunately, acute symptomatic HIV infection is rarely diagnosed by health care providers, as its symptoms are often attributed to other viral infections or secondary syphilis.[97](#page-24-18)

Acute HIV infection is defined as having detectable HIV RN[A§](#page-9-4) or HIV p24 antigen (a major core protein of HIV) in the presence of a negative or indeterminate serologic HIV antibody test[.98](#page-24-19) Although a positive HIV RNA or HIV p24 antigen in the setting of a negative or indeterminate serologic HIV antibody test is diagnostically consistent with acute HIV infection, the diagnosis should be confirmed with an HIV antibody test performed over the next 3 months to document seroconversion.[99,100](#page-24-20) New advances in HIV testing technology (i.e., the increased use of laboratorybased fourth-generation enzyme immunoassay [EIA] tests that can detect both p24 antigen and anti-HIV antibodies in the United States) improve its diagnosis[.101,102](#page-24-21) Identifying individuals during acute HIV is an important public health goal. During acute infection, HIV replicates extensively and can achieve a very high viral load, which increases the risk of further transmission (see [Fig.](#page-8-0) [31.11\)](#page-8-0).[41,48](#page-23-10) Pregnant women in high-HIV-prevalence settings may be particularly vulnerable to acute HIV infection and subsequent mother-to-child transmission of HIV.[103](#page-24-22) Diagnosis should prompt preventive counseling to inform patients that they are highly infectious and to help reduce their risk of transmitting HIV. If testing for HIV RNA is not available but acute HIV is suspected, the patient should receive preventive counseling and repeat HIV antibody testing in 3 to 6 months.

#### **Staging of HIV Disease**

The two commonly used systems for the clinical staging of HIV disease are those developed by the WH[O104](#page-24-23) and the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC).[105](#page-24-24) Although these staging systems were defined primarily for surveillance purposes, they provide important prognostic and management information. The WHO clinical staging system classifies patients from Stage 1 (asymptomatic) to Stage 4 (life-threatening opportunistic infections

or HIV-associated conditions) based on clinical and laboratory findings [\(Box 31.3](#page-10-0)). In resource-limited settings, inadequate laboratory capacity can limit the ability to measure CD4 cell counts or diagnose HIV-associated illnesses and accurately stage disease. The CDC surveillance case definitions are summarized in [Table 31.2.](#page-9-5)

In the absence of effective ART, HIV infection induces progressive immune suppression. Opportunistic illnesses closely relate to the degree of immune suppression. The risk for specific opportunistic illness can be anticipated based on the patient's CD4 count. Conversely, the occurrence of certain opportunistic illnesses can be a marker for the degree of HIV disease progression. [Fig. 31.12](#page-11-0) illustrates the CD4 T-lymphocyte counts at which opportunistic illnesses typically occur.

#### **Opportunistic Infections and Malignancies**

Variation in risk by gender for some opportunistic illnesses has been reported (i.e., higher rates of tuberculosis among HIV-infected me[n106](#page-24-25)); however, observed differences have not been great enough to alter screening and prophylaxis recommendations for women compared with men. Disease in children mirrors that in adults, with several important differences.[107](#page-24-26) Cytomegalovirus (CMV) and disseminated herpes simplex virus (HSV) infections are more common in adults, whereas lymphoid interstitial pneumonia (also known as *pulmonary lymphoid hyperplasia*) causes substantial illness among HIV-infected children.[108](#page-24-27) The prevalence of *Pneumocystis jirovecii* pneumonia (PCP) among adults in most of sub-Saharan Africa is thought to be low compared with other parts of the world, but PCP is a substantial cause of morbidity and mortality among African children[.109](#page-24-28) The low incidence and prevalence may reflect difficulty in making a definitive diagnosis.

Visceral leishmaniasis occurs in parts of sub-Saharan Africa, around the Mediterranean Sea, on the Indian subcontinent, and in South America. In Southeast Asia, most notably Thailand, systemic infection with the fungus *Penicillium marneffei* occurs with advanced immunosuppression (CD4 cell count <50 cells/µL)[.110](#page-24-29) *Histoplasma capsulatum* occurs throughout the central and southern United States, the tropics, and subtropics but is rare in Europe and Asia[.111,112](#page-24-30) Finally, there is substantial overlap between geographic areas affected by HIV, tuberculosis, and malaria ([Figs. 31.13](#page-11-1) and [31.14](#page-12-0))[.113](#page-24-31)

Management of opportunistic illnesses is complex and must be tailored to the local spectrum of disease.[109,114](#page-24-28) The WHO and others have developed and updated international guidelines for the management of opportunistic infections[.115,116](#page-24-32) High costs, drug availability, the need for a cold chain, intensive nursing support, or specialized laboratory monitoring limits the ability to manage some infections. Selected opportunistic infections, HIV-associated malignancies, and disease syndromes are described next.

### **Fungal Infections—Focus on Cryptococcal Meningitis and** *Pneumocystis* **Pneumonia**

#### Cryptococcal Meningitis

Meningitis caused by *Cryptococcus neoformans* is responsible for 15% of AIDS-related deaths worldwide (narrowly second only to TB); 73% of cases occur in sub-Saharan Africa. The substantial expansion of ART in low- and middle-income countries has led to a decrease in the absolute number of cases, but the proportion of cryptococcal AIDS mortality is stable[.117](#page-24-33) Clinical presentation of cryptococcal meningitis is characterized by indolent onset of headache, fever, malaise, and altered mental status; notably, meningismus may be minimal or absent.

Initial evaluation of suspected cryptococcal meningitis should include a serum cryptococcal antigen (CrAg), which is highly sensitive and specific[.118–120](#page-24-34) Patients with a positive serum CrAg should undergo lumbar puncture (LP) for cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) culture, CSF CrAg, and assessment for elevated intracranial pressure (CSF pressure >20 cm H2O), which is found in cryptococcal meningitis and associated with significant morbidity and mortality[.121](#page-24-35) The organism can be cultured from CSF in the majority of patients and from the blood in up to 75% of patients.[116](#page-24-36) Serum CrAg testing can be useful for screening or when LP cannot be performed.

The most effective treatment for cryptococcal meningitis (see Chapter 89) is 8-week induction therapy with a combination of amphotericin B and flucytosine followed by a consolidation phase with 400 to 800 mg of daily fluconazole for at least 2 months. Maintenance therapy with low-dose fluconazole is then given as secondary prophylaxis. If increased intracranial pressure is present, stringent management through repeated LPs[122](#page-25-0) is essential[.115](#page-24-32) If amphotericin cannot be given, fluconazole combined with flucytosine is an alternative.[123](#page-25-1) Monotherapy with high-dose fluconazole is inferio[r124,125](#page-25-2) but can be used if no other options are available.

<span id="page-12-0"></span>**Fig. 31.14** Estimated HIV prevalence in new and relapsed tuberculosis cases, 2015. (From World Health Organization. *Global tuberculosis report 2016*. Geneva: World Health Organization; 2016.)

A minority of patients with resolving cryptococcal meningitis will develop life-threatening cryptococcal immune reconstitution inflammatory syndrome (IRIS) after ART initiation, usually related to increased intracranial pressure.[126](#page-25-3) In contrast to other opportunistic infections such as PCP in which early ART is beneficial,[127](#page-25-4) multiple trials comparing early and delayed ART for patients with cryptococcal meningitis demonstrate improved survival with delay of ART initiation.[128–130](#page-25-5) For this reason, it is now recommended that ART initiation be delayed at least 2 weeks (and up to 10 weeks) after initiation of antifungal therapy. For adults and adolescents who recover from an initial episode, azole maintenance (secondary prophylaxis) can be discontinued if patients have (1) completed at least 1 year of both ART and antifungal maintenance therapy and (2) have a suppressed viral load and sustained CD4 counts of >100 cells/µL.[131](#page-25-6) Primary prophylaxis with fluconazole prevents cryptococcal disease but is not recommended for routine use in patients with unknown or negative serum CrAg status. However, studies in populations with a high prevalence (>3%) of cryptococcal antigenemia have found that routine serum or plasma CrAg screening in patients with CD4 counts of <100 cells/µL and pre-emptive antifungal therapy if CrAg positive has clinical benefit and is cost-effective.[132–135](#page-25-7)

#### *Pneumocystis* Pneumonia

PCP disease progression can be rapid, particularly in children; thus prevention by primary antimicrobial prophylaxis is a priority (see "[Special Considerations for Antimicrobial Prophylaxis in](#page-21-0)

[Resource-Limited Settings"](#page-21-0) later). PCP is most common in patients with CD4 cell counts <200 cells/µL. PCP typically presents with gradual onset of fever, dry cough, and progressive dyspnea. Hypoxia is common, and serum lactate dehydrogenase is typically elevated; the classic chest x-ray pattern is diffuse perihilar interstitial infiltrates, but a wide range of findings (including normal x-rays) can be seen.

#### **Bacterial Infections**

Although identification of bacterial illness is unusual in resourcelimited settings, epidemiologic studies have confirmed the importance of *Streptococcus pneumoniae* and non-typhoid *Salmonella* in adults and children with HIV[136,137](#page-25-8) and *Haemophilus influenzae* in children[.138,139](#page-25-9) Clinical manifestations of *S. pneumoniae* vary; pneumococcal infection presents most commonly as pneumonia or sinusitis, but meningitis also occurs. The risk of invasive pneumococcal disease in HIV-infected patients remains up to 60 times higher than the general population despite widespread use of ART.[140,141](#page-25-10)

#### **Sexually Transmitted Infections**

Many HIV-infected persons are at risk for STIs; these can also increase the risk of HIV transmission and acquisition.[142](#page-25-11) Diagnosis and management of STIs in persons with HIV is similar to persons without HIV. However, clinical presentations of some STIs can be more severe with HIV and recurrences may be more frequent. Algorithms for syndromic management of STIs have not performed as well in persons with HIV, and specific diagnoses should be confirmed where possible[.143](#page-25-12)

#### **Viral Hepatitis**

Prevalence of hepatitis B virus (HBV) and hepatitis C virus (HCV) in HIV-infected persons can be higher than in HIV-uninfected persons because of shared routes of transmission[.144](#page-25-13) Progression of chronic HBV to cirrhosis, liver failure, and hepatocellular carcinoma is more rapid in HIV/HBV co-infection, but HBV has minimal impact on the course of HIV disease or response to ART[.145](#page-25-14)

All persons with HIV and viral hepatitis should avoid alcohol consumption and use precautions to prevent transmission of viral hepatitis. A number of antiretroviral agents are active against both HIV and HBV, so baseline testing of HIV-infected persons for active hepatitis B infection is important to identify persons whose ART regimens should be tailored for coverage of both infections. (See "[Special Considerations in Patients with Chronic Hepatitis](#page-19-0) [B Virus Infection and Chronic Hepatitis C Virus Infection](#page-19-0)" later.)

In settings where HBV prevalence is high, it may be costeffective to consider empiric ART with dually active (i.e., active against both HIV and HBV) regimens. The objectives of treating HBV are normalization of alanine aminotransferase, hepatitis B e-antigen seroconversion, suppression of hepatitis B viral load, and improvement in liver histology. Withdrawal of dually active therapy in HBV co-infected patients can lead to HBV reactivation.[146](#page-25-15) Therefore HBV-infected patients on dually active regimens should be advised against self-discontinuation and closely monitored for hepatic injury if the regimen must be stopped.

In people living with HIV co-infected with HCV, the rate of liver disease progression is accelerated, especially in those with a CD4 <350 cells/µL[.147](#page-25-16) The advent of direct-acting antivirals that target HCV replication has dramatically increased rates of sustained virologic response, and current directly acting antiviral-based HCV treatment regimens are shorter and more well tolerated than previous interferon-based therapies[.148](#page-25-17) HIV/HCV co-infected patients have success rates similar to those with HCV monoinfection; thus all patients with HIV should be evaluated for HCV therapy[.149–152](#page-25-18)

#### **Schistosomiasis**

Urogenital schistosomiasis is a persistent disease acquired primarily in childhood by exposure to *Schistosoma haematobium,* causing disease in the urinary or genital tract (see Chapter 126). Due to the presence of pathologic alterations in the vagina or cervix before sexual debut, female genital schistosomiasis (FGS, which is caused by *S. haematobium*) might increase the acquisition of HIV in women.[153](#page-25-19) Furthermore, the epidemics of HIV and schistosomiasis closely overlap; communities with the highest burden of these helminths also have high HIV prevalence rates.[154–157](#page-25-20) Mathematical modeling predicts that mass drug administration targeted at school-age children to treat schistosomiasis could reduce HIV incidence by 9% to 22% and overall HIV prevalence by 6% to 20%[.158](#page-25-21)

The biological plausibility of an association between FGS and HIV infection is based on two concepts: impaired barrier function of the genital epithelium and deleterious effects of immunomodulation in schistosomiasis.

FGS increases susceptibility to HIV infection through disruption of the vaginal and cervical epithelium caused by thinning, erosion, inflammation, or ulceration. HIV in semen might have easier access to deeper genital cell layers in women with FGS because of the friable epithelium and bleeding during coitus. Females with FGS have a threefold to fourfold increased risk of HIV acquisition.[159,160](#page-25-22)

# **THE APPROACH TO COMMON CLINICAL PRESENTATIONS**

#### **Fever**

Prolonged fever is common, especially among patients with low CD4 cell counts (e.g., <200 cells/µL) who are not receiving ART,[161](#page-25-23) and the differential diagnosis is broad and varies with geography and level of immune compromise. Infectious etiologies are responsible for the majority of fevers, but malignancy is an important consideration.

Tuberculosis should be considered in all patients with fever, especially if cough, shortness of breath, weight loss, night sweats, or lymphadenopathy are present (see [Chapter 31.1\)](#page--1-0)[.136](#page-25-8) Other causes of fever are cryptococcal disease, bacteremia, pneumonia, malaria, CMV, and lymphoma. Multiple concurrent infections can occur.

The diagnostic workup for fever should be driven by the clinical presentation and availability of diagnostic tests. Blood cultures, blood smear for malaria, mycobacterial blood cultures, and serum CrAg testing can be helpful. Chest radiography, urine culture, bone marrow aspirate and biopsy, and other radiologic studies (e.g., brain imaging, abdominal imaging) may be necessary. Certain etiologies such as mycobacterial disease, *Pneumocystis, Bartonella,* lymphoma, and certain fungal infections can be particularly difficult to diagnose and should be considered when fever persists and standard diagnostic workup is negative.

#### **Dermatologic Disease**

Dermatologic disease can have a broad differential diagnosis, especially in patients with advanced immunosuppression. The International Antiviral Society-USA [\(www.iasusa.org](http://www.iasusa.org/)) has useful reference materials[162](#page-25-24) focused on HIV-associated dermatologic disease in Africa.

Pruritic papular eruption is common in tropical environments. It presents with extremely pruritic papules (<1 cm) predominately on the extremities that can be hyperpigmented and excoriated from scratching.[163](#page-25-25) Pruritic papular eruption is diagnosed clinically and improves with ART; topical steroids and capsaicin can mitigate symptoms. Bacterial folliculitis can present with lesions similar to pruritic papular eruption. However, the lesions are follicular, fewer in number, variably pruritic, and occur more commonly on the upper trunk and buttocks. Eosinophilic folliculitis presents with pruritic papules on the face, neck, and upper trunk and can mimic acne. It responds best to ART but may paradoxically worsen. Topical steroids or oral itraconazole can improve symptoms.

Scabies can also present with pruritic papular lesions; however, scabies lesions tend to be clustered in the finger webs, waist, ankles, axillae, breasts, and genital areas, and burrows are sometimes seen. Severe scabies ("Norwegian" scabies) can present with a crusted, thick, grayish scale over much of the body. Oral ivermectin or topical agents are effective. Prurigo nodularis, a disorder of unknown pathogenesis, presents with firm, dome-shaped, intensely pruritic nodules that often start on extensor surfaces of the extremities with a symmetric distribution. Management rests on symptomatic treatment of pruritus along with superpotent topical corticosteroids and, if available, phototherapy.

Seborrheic dermatitis presents with dandruff and indistinct plaques of yellowish scale involving the scalp, face, chest, back, and groin. Although it is typically seen on the hair-bearing areas of the head, it can also occur in skin folds (e.g., axillae, inner thighs) especially in HIV-infected patients in Africa. Mild cases respond to dandruff shampoo. More severe cases require topical antifungals directed against *Pityrosporum* yeasts, such as *Malassezia furfur,* and topical steroids.

Photodermatitis frequently occurs among HIV-infected patients in Africa and presents with an itchy, scaly rash on sun-exposed areas of skin. Management rests on sun protection and topical steroids.

Human herpesvirus 8 infection (HHV-8), the cause of Kaposi's sarcoma (KS), is endemic to much of Africa. KS commonly occurs in patients with advanced HIV disease (see ["HIV-Associated](#page-15-0) [Malignancies](#page-15-0)" later)[.164](#page-25-26) It presents with reddish, violaceous, or brown non-tender macules and papules that progress to nodules. KS often involves the head and neck but can involve several anatomic sites; oral lesions on the tongue, palate, and buccal mucosa may precede skin disease. Advanced KS causes widely disseminated skin disease with lymphatic obstruction and involvement of the lungs and gastrointestinal tract. Bacillary angiomatosis caused by infection with *Bartonella henselae* or *B. quintana* can cause similar lesions as KS but is treated effectively with antibiotics.

Molluscum contagiosum is caused by a poxvirus and is common in HIV-infected children. It presents with dome-shaped, umbilicated papules. Disseminated cryptococcosis can present with similar lesions that precede the development of systemic disease, but the onset is usually abrupt.

Genital and non-genital warts caused by human papillomavirus (HPV) are common in tropical environments, and HIV-infected children may develop hundreds of flat warts. Syphilis should be considered in patients presenting with disseminated maculopapular skin disease or condylomata lata.

Mucocutaneous eruptions, blisters, or other erosive dermal lesions should prompt consideration of Stevens–Johnson syndrome or toxic epidermal necrolysis[.165,166](#page-25-27) Decisions on whether to stop treatment with the suspect agent should be made on a case-by-case basis.

# **Ophthalmologic Disease**

Eye disease is an important complication of HIV[.167–169](#page-25-28) CMV retinitis is the most common cause of retinal disease and vision loss with advanced immunosuppression (i.e., CD4 cell count <50 cells/µL)[.168](#page-25-29) CMV retinitis can be diagnosed by retinal examination that demonstrates large white or creamy lesions with granular borders and associated hemorrhage. Lesions often begin in the periphery and progress centrally; patients complain of unilateral floaters followed by progressively decreased visual acuity and eventual blindness. CMV retinitis should be treated with ART and CMV antiviral therapy (specifically oral valganciclovir or intravenous ganciclovir). Retinal microangiopathy, the most common retinal abnormality seen in HIV infection, has characteristic "cotton-wool" spots that can be confused with CMV retinitis.[170](#page-26-0) These lesions are not sight threatening and often resolve spontaneously[.171](#page-26-1) Immune recovery uveitis can occur in up to 20% of HIV-infected individuals with increasing CD4 counts after initiation of ART and concurrent CMV retinitis[,172](#page-26-2) although it can also be caused by other opportunistic infections that have ocular manifestations such as tuberculosis or toxoplasmosis.[173](#page-26-3) Other causes of rapid vision loss are progressive outer retinal necrosis caused by varicella-zoster virus and, less commonly, by herpes simplex. The incidence of ocular syphilis (chorioretinitis and uveitis) may be increasing among HIV-infected patients receiving ART[.170](#page-26-0) Squamous cell carcinoma of the conjunctiva, corneal microsporidiosis, and ocular tuberculosis can also cause ophthalmologic disease in resource-limited settings.

#### **Pulmonary Disease**

TB is among the most frequently identified pathogens in clinical and autopsy case series of lung disease in HIV-infected patients in resource-limited settings, and should be considered with any pulmonary infection (see [Chapter 31.1](#page--1-0)). Community-acquired bacterial pneumonia, frequently caused by *S. pneumoniae,* is the next most common cause of lung disease.[174,175](#page-26-4) TB and community-acquired pneumonia can occur at any time during HIV infection, but risk increases as the CD4 cell count declines. Cotrimoxazole prophylaxis and pneumococcal conjugate vaccination may be effective prevention strategies[.176,177](#page-26-5) Studies in sub-Saharan Africa have found very low incidence of PCP. However, this may be due to lack of diagnostic capacity[.178](#page-26-6) HIV-infected persons with a history of TB may be at increased risk of PCP.[179](#page-26-7) KS, histoplasmosis, cryptococcosis, nocardiosis, and, in children, lymphoid interstitial pneumonitis are less common causes of pulmonary disease.

Pleural effusions are most often secondary to infection or malignancy[.180](#page-26-8) Pleural TB can occur with or without parenchymal disease. Tuberculous pleural effusions are exudative, lymphocytic, and not acidic or hypoglycemic. They typically demonstrate concentrations of adenosine deaminase greater than 50 U/L.[181](#page-26-9) A pleural fluid acid-fast smear is positive in less than 15% of cases, but a sputum smear may be positive. Pleural biopsies with examination for acid-fast bacilli and granulomas have the highest likelihood of confirming pleural infection. Bacterial pneumonia often causes parapneumonic effusions. KS, multicentric Castleman's disease, primary effusion lymphoma, B-cell non-Hodgkin's lymphoma, and lung cancer are malignant causes of effusion.

#### **Esophageal Disease**

Dysphagia (i.e., difficulty swallowing) and odynophagia (i.e., pain on swallowing) occur with advanced HIV infection and suggest esophagitis. Candidiasis is the most common cause[116,182](#page-24-36) and is usually associated with oropharyngeal candidiasis (thrush). Presumptive treatment for candidal esophagitis with fluconazole is usually indicated, especially in patients with a CD4 count <200 cells/µL or if oral thrush is present. Patients who do not respond to fluconazole can be treated with a higher dose; patients with refractory symptoms should receive upper endoscopy with biopsy. Other etiologies are CMV, herpes simplex virus, and aphthous ulcers, each of which tends to be associated with more prominent odynophagia (often without dysphagia).

# **Gastroenteritis/Diarrheal Disease**

Diarrhea is common among HIV-infected persons and is associated with lower CD4 counts.[183](#page-26-10) Acute diarrhea suggests a viral or bacterial pathogen, although certain parasitic infections (e.g., *Isospora belli, Entamoeba histolytica*) can present acutely. Diarrhea and fever suggest *Salmonella, Shigella,* or *Campylobacter,* especially if mucus or blood is in the stool.[184](#page-26-11) Bacterial diarrhea should be treated with antibiotic[s116](#page-24-36) guided by culture and antimicrobial sensitivity testing where available. Enteric viruses (e.g., norovirus) and pathogenic *Escherichia coli* (e.g., enterohemorrhagic *E. coli*) can also cause acute diarrhea.[185,186](#page-26-12) In developed nations, *Clostridium difficile* occurs among HIV-infected patients exposed to antibiotics or who have been hospitalized.[187](#page-26-13) Non-infectious etiologies of acute diarrhea include drugs, food poisoning, lactose intolerance, inflammatory bowel disease, or infiltrative diseases (i.e., lymphoma). ART, especially protease inhibitors, can also cause diarrhea and should be considered if other etiologies are excluded.[188](#page-26-14) ART-associated diarrhea can often be managed symptomatically but in severe cases may require an alternative medication.

Cryptosporidiosis due to infection with *Cryptosporidium parvum, C. hominis,* or *C. maleagridis* is a cause of chronic diarrhea in patients with a low CD4 count (<200 cells/µL)[.189–192](#page-26-15) Other causes are isosporiasis, microsporidiosis, *Mycobacterium avium* complex, cyclosporiasis, and CMV. Giardiasis, amebiasis, and strongyloidiasis can occur at any stage of HIV infection. Even with access to diagnostic testing and endoscopy with biopsy, a significant proportion of chronic diarrhea has no pathogen identified and is attributed to HIV enteropathy[.193](#page-26-16) Although some causes of chronic diarrhea can be treated, cryptosporidiosis and microsporidiosis are often refractory to antimicrobial therapy alone and require immune reconstitution with ART.[194](#page-26-17)

#### **Focal Central Nervous System Lesions**

HIV-infected patients with advanced immunosuppression who present with focal neurologic symptoms or seizures often have a central nervous system (CNS) mass lesion caused by an opportunistic infection or HIV-associated malignancy. The evaluation and management of these lesions can be challenging if access to radiography and neurosurgery are limited[.195,196](#page-26-18) The most common etiology of focal CNS lesions in low-income settings has been TB (tuberculomas)[,195](#page-26-18) but neurocysticercosis, toxoplasma encephalitis, primary CNS lymphoma, non-Hodgkin's lymphoma, bacterial brain abscess, cryptococcosis, and, in South America, brain chagoma caused by *Trypanosoma cruzi* are important considerations. TB should be strongly suspected if there is evidence of non-neurologic TB (e.g., lung disease), basal meningeal enhancement on computed tomography scan, or a CSF pleocytosis with a high protein.

Toxoplasma encephalitis presents with fever, headache, weakness, altered mental status or confusion, and often seizures; physical examination usually demonstrates focal neurologic abnormalities.[197](#page-26-19) Most patients have a CD4 cell count <100 cells/µL and positive toxoplasma serology[.198](#page-26-20) For persons with radiographic findings suspicious for toxoplasma, empiric therapy with pyrimethamine, sulfadiazine, and leucovorin is indicated; clinical improvement should be seen within 1 to 2 weeks if the diagnosis is correct. In resource-limited settings, use of trimethoprim–sulfamethoxazole may be considered if first-line drugs are not available[.199,200](#page-26-21)

Progressive multifocal leukoencephalopathy is an insidious and progressive disorder caused by JC virus, which is named after John Cunningham, the patient in whom it was first detected. It usually presents with one or more rapidly progressive focal neurologic deficits without fever in advanced HIV infection.[116](#page-24-36) The diagnosis can be made by identification of JC virus in CSF or demonstration of characteristic lesions by CNS imaging. No specific therapy exists; treatment is ART to restore immunity against the virus.

#### **HIV-Associated Neurocognitive Disorder**

The prevalence of dementia, the most severe manifestation of HIV-associated neurocognitive disorder (HAND), has declined with the advent of ART. However mild to moderate neurocognitive disorder may persist and even progress despite maintenance of suppressive ART[.201,202](#page-26-22) Studies in Africa and other less-resourced settings are limited but do suggest high prevalence of HAND with concerns about the potential impact on children infected with HIV[.203](#page-26-23) A randomized controlled trial investigating CNStargeted antiretrovirals failed to show evidence of neurocognitive benefit.[204](#page-26-24) However, a large trial of second-line ART did show high prevalence of HAND at first-line ART failure and improvements in neurocognitive function with successful second-line therapy[.205](#page-26-25)

#### **Immune Reconstitution Inflammatory Syndrome**

IRIS is a widely recognized syndrome associated with the initiation of ART that presents in one of two ways: (1) paradoxical IRIS associated with worsening of an active co-infection diagnosed before ART initiation and (2) unmasking IRIS where a clinically quiescent co-infection is triggered by ART initiation, often with atypical or severe manifestations.[206](#page-26-26) Frequency of IRIS varies and is dependent on CD4 count at ART initiation[.207](#page-26-27) IRIS has been more commonly associated with mycobacterial infections, usually TB, as well as CMV retinitis, cryptococcal meningitis, and progressive multifocal leukoencephalopathy.[206](#page-26-26) However, it has occurred with almost every AIDS-associated opportunistic infection and a variety of non–AIDS-associated infections and illnesses.[208,209](#page-26-28) Although IRIS can be associated with death, hospitalization, and ART interruptions,[207](#page-26-27) the benefits of early initiation of ART outweigh the risk. IRIS can usually be managed without interrupting ART by treating the associated co-infection and providing supportive care, which can include non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs or corticosteroids. ART should be stopped with IRIS that is either life threatening or that cannot be managed with supportive care.

#### <span id="page-15-0"></span>**HIV-Associated Malignancies**

Persons with HIV infection are at increased risk for three AIDSrelated malignancies: KS, non-Hodgkin's lymphomas, and cervical cancer[.105,210](#page-24-24) The incidence of KS and non-Hodgkin's lymphomas has declined dramatically in high-income countries among persons receiving ART.[211–213](#page-26-29) In regions where life expectancies of people living with HIV infection have increased, the incidence of non– AIDS-associated malignancies have increased at rates in excess of rates for the same cancers in HIV-uninfected persons[.214](#page-26-30) Whether similar trends are occurring in resource-limited settings is difficult to determine[.215](#page-26-31) Many non-AIDS malignancies are associated with chronic oncogenic viral infections: HPV (anal and oropharyngeal cancer), Epstein–Barr virus (non-Hodgkin's lymphoma), and viral hepatitis B and C (hepatoma)[.216,217](#page-26-32) Anal cancer is particularly common and is more prevalent than some AIDS-related malignancies[.214](#page-26-30) Others are associated with lifestyle factors that are more prevalent among certain populations. Some data suggest that HIV infection independently increases risk for non-AIDS malignancies; however, it is not evident whether ART affects this risk.[218–220](#page-26-33)

#### Kaposi's Sarcoma

KS is caused by HHV-8 and the endemic prevalence (i.e., HIV unassociated) generally correlates with regional HHV-8 seroprevalence; however, immunosuppression from HIV can increase the incidence and prevalence of KS.[221–224](#page-26-34) KS is common in African countries of Zambia, Democratic Republic of Congo, Zimbabwe, Uganda, Rwanda, and Burundi[.225–227](#page-27-0) Although endemic KS is uncommon in the Americas, Europe, and Asia, persons with HIV infection, and especially men who have sex with men, experience greater incidence of disease.[228](#page-27-1) With ART, KS may regress,[229](#page-27-2) and protease inhibitors appear to have specific activity against HHV-8[.230](#page-27-3) Extensive visceral or rapidly progressive disease often requires cytotoxic chemotherapy and radiation therapy, which are generally palliative and not curative.[223](#page-27-4)

#### Non-Hodgkin's Lymphoma

Non-Hodgkin's lymphomas are the second most common malignancy associated with HIV infection and comprise a heterogeneous group of tumors that are almost all of B-cell origin.[231](#page-27-5) Many of these tumors appear causally related to either Epstein–Barr virus or HHV-8.[232](#page-27-6) Incidence is increased substantially among patients with low CD4 cell counts. Diagnosis is based on clinical presentation (e.g., lymphadenopathy, fevers, night sweats, weight loss) and biopsy. Treatment and prognosis vary according to the type of tumor and available therapy.

#### Cervical Cancer

Cervical cancer is a leading cause of death among women worldwide and a common AIDS-related malignancy.[233](#page-27-7) The vast majority of cervical cancers, including among HIV-infected women, are caused by infection with oncogenic types of HPV.[234,235](#page-27-8) HPV infections are more common and persistent in women with HIV. Incidence of cervical cancer has not declined significantly in high-income settings where ART use is widespread,[215](#page-26-31) although women who are adherent to ART demonstrate lower incidence and prevalence of oncogenic HPV types[.236](#page-27-9)

Screening and earlier intervention are key aspects of preventing cervical cancer. Traditional population-based cervical cancer prevention programs that rely upon examination of cervical cells face substantial barriers to sustainability in resource-limited settings. Innovative "see-and-treat" programs, where women with cervical pathology during direct visual examination of the cervix after application of acetic acid are treated at the same visit with cryotherapy, show great promise.[237](#page-27-10) National programs to vaccinate young women and men against HPV before sexual debut could substantially reduce the burden of cervical cancer and other HPV-associated malignancies.

# **PATIENT EVALUATION, DIAGNOSIS, AND DIFFERENTIAL DIAGNOSIS**

# **HIV Testing**

Many persons with HIV infection do not get tested until late in their disease.[238](#page-27-11) Not only is their access to ART delayed, but they remain unaware of the need to protect their sex or needle-sharing partners from becoming infected. HIV-infected persons will decrease risk behaviors when they are aware of their positive HIV status.[239,240](#page-27-12) Medical treatment that lowers plasma HIV viral load also reduces risk for transmission to others[.241–243](#page-27-13) An international randomized clinical trial demonstrated that treating an HIV-infected individual with antiretrovirals can reduce the risk of sexual transmission of HIV to their HIV-uninfected partner by 96%.[244](#page-27-14)

In countries with generalized epidemics, the WHO recommends HIV testing all persons accessing health care. "Opt-out" HIV testing should be considered a part of standard of routine clinical care. The highest priority for testing should be given to persons with syndromes that suggest HIV infection (see [Box 31.2\)](#page-9-0) and to persons whose behaviors or exposures substantially increase their risk of acquiring HIV.

All pregnant women should be tested at their initial antenatal visit. HIV testing can identify women who need ART for their own health and for prevention of maternal-to-child HIV transmission. In the absence of perinatal prophylaxis or interventions to prevent transmission at birth[245–248](#page-27-15) and through breastfeeding[,249,250](#page-27-16) approximately 15% to 40% of infants born to HIV-infected mothers will become infected. Timely perinatal prophylaxis for the mother and infant, and administration of ART to the mother or infant while breastfeeding, can reduce the rate to <1%.[40,55,251–255](#page-23-19)

Clinicians should also consider testing all women during their third trimester or at delivery, especially in regions with a generalized HIV epidemic among women of reproductive age. Among women whose previous testing was negative, re-testing can identify women who have become HIV infected or who were seroconverting. A second HIV test during the third trimester is cost-effective.[256,257](#page-27-17)

HIV testing should be available and offered to persons in the general population. Effective models have used rapid test kits that allow for immediate delivery of test results and have employed trained lay counselors in settings with health care worker shortages. In populations with a high HIV prevalence, testing is feasible in rural settings and can be effectively offered by teams going door to door[.258](#page-27-18) HIV test results should be presented with counseling about HIV prevention and risk reduction. For persons who test positive, it is critical to provide psychosocial support and clinical services and to ensure patients are linked into, medical car[e259](#page-27-19) (see "[Post-Test HIV Counseling](#page-17-0)" later).

#### <span id="page-16-1"></span>**HIV Diagnosis**

HIV infection should be diagnosed with a rapid or conventional serologic assay for antibodies against HIV (e.g., an EIA) through voluntary counseling and testing services. Rapid HIV testing is faster, is less costly, and increases the number of clients who receive their results.[260](#page-27-20)

Results that are reactive by a serologic assay should be confirmed with another assay, particularly before ART initiation. Clinicians should follow local guidelines for confirmatory testing, which may involve repeat HIV testing with a different rapid EIA test or an assay that directly detects HIV RNA.

In low-income settings with a high HIV prevalence, algorithms use a series of rapid tests to confirm HIV infection ([Fig. 31.15](#page-16-0)). Although different HIV tests/assays have sensitivities and specificities that approach 99.9%, false-positive and false-negative results are known to occur. False-positive serology is more frequent among persons with autoimmune disease, multiple myeloma, chronic renal failure, in persons recently vaccinated, in multiparous women, and in persons who have been vaccinated with a candidate HIV vaccine in clinical trials. Importantly, in low-prevalence situations (e.g., <0.1% HIV prevalence), even tests with high specificity may

yield a relatively high proportion of falsely positive results. Falsenegative results can occur during acute HIV infection when the person has not yet developed detectable anti-HIV antibodies (i.e., seroconversion), termed the *window period*. Certain tests can detect HIV RNA and other HIV antigens (e.g., p24) early in infection during this "window period"; however, there still remains a period between infection and the ability to detect the virus, termed the *eclipse phase*. During both the window period and eclipse phase, HIV-infected persons can transmit infection.

HIV infection in infants and children younger than 18 months cannot be reliably diagnosed with serology because of the persistence of transplacentally acquired maternal antibody[.261](#page-27-21) Prompt diagnosis of HIV-infected infants with molecular virologic testing and immediate ART initiation is essential because a high proportion (15%–20%) experience rapid disease progression within the first year of lif[e262;](#page-27-22) HIV-infected infants require early initiation of ART and opportunistic infection prophylaxis to survive. Molecular HIV testing of newborns and infants can be performed by detecting HIV RNA and DNA (preferred if the mother is taking ART).

HIV testing algorithms should use HIV diagnostic tests that have a high sensitivity for locally circulating HIV subtypes (clades). Most HIV EIA tests can detect the vast majority of emerging HIV-1 subtypes and CRFs; certain assays can also detect HIV-1 group O and N[.263–267](#page-27-23) Most current EIA tests also detect both HIV-1 and HIV-2, but only a few tests will distinguish between them. Patients whose EIA suggests dual infection should be confirmed with HIV-1 and HIV-2 specific RNA testing or other confirmatory tests. Many commercial molecular tests can detect and quantify most HIV subtypes; certain assays can quantify group O and N viruses[.268,269](#page-27-24) False-negative molecular tests, however, have been reported with URFs[.270,271](#page-28-0)

### <span id="page-17-0"></span>**Post-Test HIV Counseling**

Post-test counseling is necessary for all patients who test positive.[259](#page-27-19) Emotional support should be provided to address issues of stigma and fear of disclosing one's HIV status. Risk reduction information and the value of male and female condoms should be provided in non-judgmental language. Ideally, these devices should be made available to the client. Counseling should emphasize that HIV infection can be treated. Patients should be encouraged to disclose their status to trusted family members and friends. Any known sexual or needle-sharing contacts should seek HIV testing. Providers should also provide referrals to appropriate follow-up services.

## **INITIAL EVALUATION OF THE NEWLY DIAGNOSED PATIENT**

Multiple guidelines and recommendations for the evaluation, treatment, and monitoring for the evaluation of HIV-infected adults and children are available and should be consulted [\(Box](#page-17-1) [31.4](#page-17-1)).[272–275](#page-28-1) To ensure correct diagnosis, the WHO recommends that all people newly diagnosed with HIV should be re-tested

with a second specimen before ART initiation[.276](#page-28-2) The initial visit should include a detailed history and a thorough physical. The medical history should screen for opportunistic infections and note any past HIV-related illnesses, other medical conditions, or hospitalizations. Particular attention should be given to assessment of potential TB, especially in areas with a high burden of TB, where active disease is present in up to 20% to 30% of HIV-infected persons receiving clinical care.[275](#page-28-3) A detailed sexual history should review sexual practices; past STIs; obstetric/gynecologic history (including plans for pregnancy); contraceptive use; all sexual partners; and recreational drug, alcohol, and tobacco use. The physical examination should be performed with attention to the skin, lymphatic, oral, anogenital, and fundoscopic examination. Women should undergo pelvic examination with assessment for cervical disease by cytology (e.g., Papanicolaou smear) or visual inspection with acetic acid. Baseline laboratory testing typically includes assessment for anemia, co-infections (e.g., hepatitis B, hepatitis C, syphilis), and abnormalities in liver and kidney function.

Patients should be staged clinically and immunologically. The WHO staging system classifies patients based on clinical and laboratory findings (see [Box 31.3\)](#page-10-0).[104](#page-24-23) Determination of CD4 cell count, if available, provides the most accurate assessment of risk for opportunistic illnesses and death and is also used to guide opportunistic infection prophylaxis and screening. In resourcelimited settings, HIV viral load measurement and HIV genotypic resistance testing are not recommended as baseline studies in patients not yet on ART.[275](#page-28-3)

#### <span id="page-17-2"></span>**Initial Evaluation of Newly Diagnosed Women of Reproductive Age**

All newly diagnosed women of reproductive age should be assessed for pregnancy and, if pregnant, provided linkage services for immediate ART and counseling to prevent perinatal HIV transmission to their infant.[277](#page-28-4) Clinicians should query non-pregnant women regarding their intentions for future pregnancies and provide contraceptive counseling. Use of dual methods (i.e., hormonal contraception combined with male or female condoms) may be appropriate, but due to potential interactions between select ARVs and hormonal contraceptives, consultation of more detailed guidance is recommended[.278](#page-28-5) HIV-infected women who are contemplating pregnancy should receive standard pre-conception guidance and counseling regarding the risk for HIV transmission to their infant. To maximally reduce the risk of vertical transmission, HIV-infected women should attain suppressed maternal viral load before conception[278](#page-28-5) and maintain suppression throughout pregnancy and breastfeeding, as the level of maternal viremia is directly proportional to the risk of vertical transmission. Risk is substantially increased within a narrow viral load range, even with ART use[.279](#page-28-6)

#### **ANTIRETROVIRAL THERAPY**

#### **Introduction**

Expert guidance on ART is available from many reputable sources (see [Box 31.4](#page-17-1)). Most resource-limited countries develop specific national guidance. Guidelines are typically updated every 2-3 years and should be consulted for the most recent guidance.

Although combination ART became the standard of care in developed nations after its introduction in 1996, few had access to these lifesaving drugs. With public–private partnerships, by mid-2017, 20.9 million of the estimated 36.7 million people living with HIV (13.8 of 25.5 million in sub-Saharan Africa) were receiving ART[.1](#page-22-0)

# **Goals of ART**

The goal of ART is to maximally suppress HIV replication and improve the health of the individual. At the individual level, ART

is not only associated with a reduction in sexual transmission of HIV from an HIV-infected individual to their HIV-uninfected partne[r244](#page-27-14) but also a reduction in mortality due to both AIDS-related conditions and non–AIDS-related conditions such as cancer and cardiovascular disease[.272](#page-28-1) At the population level, reduction of the viral load of the community of HIV-infected persons leads to decreases in new HIV infections[.280,281](#page-28-7)

#### **When to Start**

The introduction of simplified formulations (e.g., once- or twicedaily combination pills), more tolerable and durable medications, and antiretrovirals that target new steps in HIV's life cycle (e.g., integrase inhibitors, CCR5 inhibitors) have improved treatment options during earlier stages of disease (i.e., at higher CD4 cell counts). Observational cohort studies have also demonstrated that initiation of continuous ART at higher CD4 cell counts improves survival, increases AIDS-free survival, reduces non–AIDS-associated outcomes,[282–284](#page-28-8) and may help control inflammatory responses related to chronic HIV infection[.283–285](#page-28-9) WHO and other global guidelines recommend ART initiation in all people living with HIV, regardless of CD4 count or stage of disease.[286](#page-28-10) This recent recommendation is partially in response to two recently published randomized controlled trials that demonstrated that starting ART regardless of stage or CD4 count provides a net benefit to the individual[287,288](#page-28-11) along with the earlier publication of HPTN 052 showing the benefit of ART in preventing HIV transmission.[244](#page-27-14) HIV-infected persons with CD4 cell counts <200 cells/µL can be at increased risk for opportunistic infections and/or IRIS, and thus it is important to assess the CD4 cell count. Rapid initiation of ART after diagnosis of HIV infection may be associated with improved outcomes[.289](#page-28-12) Although there are concerns that early initiation of ART in persons co-infected with TB may be associated with life-threatening TB-IRIS, a recent systematic review suggested that all-cause mortality is reduced.[289](#page-28-12) However, death due to IRIS remains a concern in persons with active cryptococcal meningitis, and a minimum of a 2-week delay in ART initiation is currently recommended.[290,291](#page-28-13)

#### **Initiating Therapy for Women of Reproductive Age**

Most HIV-infected women and men remain sexually active, and many continue to have children or to not use any form of contraception.[292–294](#page-28-14) Women of reproductive age presenting for care must be assessed for pregnancy before starting therapy and referred for contraceptive counseling if not pregnant (see ["Initial](#page-17-2) [Evaluation of Newly Diagnosed Women of Reproductive Age](#page-17-2)" earlier). ART should be offered to pregnant women with HIV infection who need it for their own health and started as early as possible in pregnancy for PMTCT.

#### **What to Start**

More than 20 antiretroviral drugs are commercially available. Antiretrovirals are characterized within five drug classes according to their mechanism of action ([Table 31.3](#page-18-0)). The oldest, and most widely used, drugs against HIV are nucleoside/nucleotide analogs that inhibit HIV reverse transcriptase (nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitors [NRTIs]). Non-nucleoside reverse-transcriptase inhibitors (NNRTIs) target reverse transcriptase but are structurally dissimilar to endogenous nucleosides and to each other. Protease inhibitors inhibit the HIV protease and interrupt assembly of the mature virion. Protease inhibitors are typically co-administered with either cobicistat or a low dose (e.g., 100 mg) of ritonavir, the protease inhibitor that "boosts" the serum concentration of the other protease inhibitors by inhibiting their hepatic metabolism. Integrase inhibitors target HIV's integrase enzyme and block integration of HIV DNA into the host genome. Entry inhibitors

block entry of HIV into the cell and include fusion inhibitors and agents that block the CCR5 co-receptor. As of 2017, this class is not available in most resource-limited settings.

Since 2002, the WHO has recommended use of standardized treatment regimens in resource-limited settings with reduced frequency of monitoring compared with high-income countries.[295](#page-28-15) [Table 31.4](#page-19-1) lists combinations of first-line antiretrovirals recommended by the WHO. Standardization of treatment allows for task shifting and special considerations in certain populations.

Special Considerations for Women Previously Given Antiretroviral Drugs as Prevention of Mother-to-Child Transmission of HIV

Women who require PMTCT should be given highly active triple-combination ART; this strategy reduces the risk of perinatal HIV transmission and minimizes development of resistance. In

resource-limited settings, many programs have used only one or two drugs. Antiretroviral resistance can emerge under these circumstances[,296](#page-28-16) particularly resistance to lamivudine[297](#page-28-17) and nevirapine.[298,299](#page-28-18) The resistance mutation to lamivudine confers increased susceptibility of HIV to other NRTIs. Thus if this is the sole mutation present, then lamivudine can be used in combination with other NRTIs to treat mothers and their HIV-infected infants. Women who can wait at least 1 year after having received nevirapine prophylaxis for PMTCT respond as well to NNRTI-containing highly active antiretroviral therapy (HAART), as women who had not been exposed to nevirapine[.300–307](#page-28-19) However, if less than a year has passed, a protease inhibitor-based regimen is preferred.[308](#page-28-20) Antiretroviral resistance testing should be conducted for all women and HIV-infected infants exposed to PMTCT before initiation of their own ART. Such testing remains unavailable in many areas, in which case clinicians must consider the content and timing of prior ART and the likelihood of resistance.

#### Special Considerations for Pregnant Women

The NNRTIs nevirapine and efavirenz (EFV) are both effective antiretroviral agents for pregnant women. In the past, EFV was not recommended for use in pregnancy because of concerns regarding potential teratogenicity.[278,309](#page-28-5) However, increasing safety data have been reassuring[,310](#page-28-21) so currently EFV use is not restricted in HIV-infected pregnant women even in the first trimester.[272,275](#page-28-1) Rash and life-threatening hepatotoxicity have been associated with nevirapine in women with CD4 cell counts >250 cells/µL.[311](#page-28-22) However, clinical experience has been reassuring regarding the safety of nevirapine in women in resource-limited settings who have CD4 cell counts >250 cells/µL[,312](#page-29-0) and it remains the alternative first-line NNRTI for pregnant women in resource-limited settings[.275](#page-28-3) In higher-income settings, protease inhibitors (particularly atazanavir and darunavir) and the integrase inhibitor raltegravir are preferred for pregnant women over NNRTIs[.278](#page-28-5) Although some countries now recommend first-line ART regimens for both pregnant and non-pregnant adults that substitute dolutegravir for EFV[,313](#page-29-1) limited data on dolutegravir in pregnancy have precluded recommendation by WHO, although dolutegravir is an alternative integrase inhibitor in some countries[.275,314](#page-28-3)

<span id="page-19-0"></span>Special Considerations in Patients With Chronic Hepatitis B Virus Infection and Chronic Hepatitis C Virus Infection Patients with HBV and HIV co-infection are at increased risk for chronic HBV and its complication[s315,316](#page-29-2); earlier initiation of ART is associated with a reduction in liver disease (see "[Select Major](#page-10-1) [Opportunistic Infections and Co-infections"](#page-10-1) earlier). Several antiretroviral agents, including lamivudine (3TC), emtricitabine (FTC), tenofovir disoproxil fumarate (TDF), and tenofovir alafenamide (TAF), are active against both HIV and HBV. Patients with HIV/HBV co-infection should be initiated on regimens that contain either TDF or TAF plus either FTC or 3TC as the backbone of a fully suppressive regimen.[272–275](#page-28-1) Use of a single agent with dual HIV and HBV activity is not recommended, as it may not suppress HBV replication and increases the risk of HBV drug resistance.

Selection of ART regimens for patients with HIV/HCV coinfection should follow the same guidance as for patients with HIV mono-infection. However, if HCV treatment is also initiated, careful attention to drug interactions is required to avoid toxicity and ensure efficacy of both HIV and HCV treatment. Further information can be found in comprehensive guidelines released by the WHO and American Association for the Study of Liver Diseases/Infectious Diseases Society of America[.317,318](#page-29-3)

#### **Adherence to Therapy**

Retention in care and adherence to ART are critical for achievement and maintenance of virologic suppression. Factors that affect ART adherence are pill burden, complexity of ART regimens, side effects, patient knowledge and attitudes, stigma and discrimination, distance from the clinic, transportation costs, user-friendliness of the services, competing priorities (e.g., employment, child care), alcohol and illicit drug use, mental illness (e.g., depression, addiction), and social instability. Systems issues, such as inadequate supplies and stockouts, can also lead to non-adherence. Suboptimal adherence is associated with treatment failure and can lead to HIV drug resistance[.319](#page-29-4)

All patients should receive adherence counseling at treatment initiation, and non-judgmental assessment of adherence should be done at each visit with support provided if necessary. Recommended evidence-based interventions include peer counselors, text messages, reminder devices, and behavioral skills training. Training health care personnel and community workers as treatment supporters can be facilitated with standardized essential messages. Adherence can be improved if health workers understand what to expect after initiating ART and how to differentiate minor side effects from more severe events that require clinical evaluation. Use of once-daily regimens and fixed-dose ART combinations that decrease pill burden may also increase adherence[.320](#page-29-5)

For pregnant and breastfeeding women, emphasizing the role of adherence in preventing transmission to the baby is a critical component of counseling messages. The expansion of viral load monitorin[g321](#page-29-6) has greatly enhanced the ability to monitor adherence. Initiatives to track patients who default on appointments or miss ART refills are important components of national ART programs[.322](#page-29-7) Successful interventions have ranged from community worker home visits to the use of cell phones and text messaging that enable facility staff to contact patients. Allowing less frequent clinical visits, less frequent medication pickups for patients stable on ART, and dispensing ART in patients' communities has also been successful in addressing patient barriers to adherence and retention.[323,324](#page-29-8)

#### **Monitoring Effectiveness**

In resource-rich settings, routine measurement of HIV viral load is well established as the gold standard for ART monitoring; it provides the most direct measure of antiretroviral effectiveness and can indirectly assess adherence.[272](#page-28-1) In resource-limited settings, however, viral load access was historically limited, so monitoring relied on use of CD4 ("immunologic criteria").[325](#page-29-9) However, this has a poor predictive value for identifying viral failure, and this delayed detection of treatment failure leads to accumulation of HIV drug resistance[.326,327](#page-29-10) In recognition of this, WHO guidelines since 2013 recommend viral load as the preferred test for monitoring ART. Routine viral load monitoring is now recognized as an essential component of ART services in resource-limited settings[.275](#page-28-3) Despite a dramatic reduction in costs of viral load reagents, scale-up of testing in these settings has been slow but continues to improve steadily[.321](#page-29-6) Because infrastructure requirements for collection, storage, and transport of plasma samples have remained daunting, many countries have based their viral load scale-up efforts on the use of dried blood spots prepared from whole blood, a modality that has shown strong correlation with plasma measurements using selected assays.[328,329](#page-29-11)

Confirming virologic failure due to resistance rather than poor adherence generally requires a repeat viral load assessment before switching ART regimens. In developed countries, genotypic antiretroviral resistance testing is recommended before starting treatment and is needed during treatment to optimize ART in patients who are virologically failing[.99](#page-24-20) Individual-level HIV drug resistance testing remains largely unavailable in resource-limited settings, and genotypes are performed primarily as part of HIV drug resistance surveillance[.330](#page-29-12) The WHO's standardized approach to second-line ART for resource-limited settings limits the need for HIV-resistance testing by making treatment recommendations on the assumption that prior treatment could have induced resistance.

# **Monitoring for Tolerability**

Antiretroviral drugs have early and late-onset side effects that can affect tolerance. Some side effects, such as headache and nausea, are common at treatment initiation but are usually transient and manageable. Newly available antiretroviral drugs have a more favorable side effect and adverse event profile than regimens used in the past.[272–275](#page-28-1)

Directed assessments for adverse events can help ensure that early side effects are identified when it is possible to change therapy to prevent their progression. As ART continues, the frequency of assessment can be decreased. Factors that may predispose patients to adverse events include concomitant medications, co-morbid conditions, and genetic factors (e.g., ABC hypersensitivity and HLA\*B5701)[.331,332](#page-29-13)

If available, routine laboratory monitoring is an important adjunct to care and can be used to monitor for ART-associated toxicities. Laboratory monitoring, however, is not a prerequisite for the initiation of ART[.275](#page-28-3) In high-income settings, guidelines typically recommend quarterly or semi-annual testing of complete blood counts, serum chemistries, and urinalyses, as well as CD4 cell count and plasma HIV viral load[.272](#page-28-1) If resources are limited, laboratory testing should be directed by clinical signs and symptoms and tailored to the patient's specific antiretroviral drugs.[275](#page-28-3)

Most patients with advanced HIV disease starting ART experience a return to health with improvements in functional status and laboratory parameters. However, high early mortality during the first 3 to 6 months of treatment has been observed among persons with advanced disease in resource-limited settings[.333,334](#page-29-14) Contributors to early mortality include undiagnosed or untreated opportunistic infection, IRIS, and severe malnutrition[.335](#page-29-15)

#### **Metabolic Complications During Treatment**

ART has been associated with the development of metabolic complications: abnormal changes in body fat distribution, serum dyslipidemias, insulin resistance and glucose intolerance, and osteopenia; many of the newer drugs (e.g., integrase inhibitors), are more "lipid neutral," and the use of the antiretroviral drugs most associated with lipoatrophy has declined significantly.[336,337](#page-29-16) Many metabolic complications increase the risk for chronic medical conditions, so attention to traditional risk factors for these disorders (e.g., tobacco use, hypertension) is essential. In industrialized nations, the care of HIV-infected persons is increasingly dominated by management of these disorders.[272](#page-28-1)

### **When to Change ART**

The goal of ART is to maintain maximal and sustained suppression of HIV replication. Adherence should be assessed at every visit. Routine measurement of HIV viral load is critical for timely identification of virologic non-suppression. A high viral load (i.e., greater than the national established threshold for suppression) should trigger a repeat testing 2 to 6 months after the patient has received enhanced adherence counseling. If the repeat load remains high, prompt switching to a suppressive ART regimen should occur.[275](#page-28-3)

Clinicians should strive to maintain HIV viral load below the limit of detection for the assay[.99](#page-24-20) However, in many resource-limited settings, virologic failure is defined as a HIV viral load ≥1000 copies/mL after at least 6 months of ART. This cutoff allows programs with limited formularies to limit switching to costly second- or third-line ART and accommodates the higher limit of detection of the different samples types used (e.g., dried blood spots)[.338](#page-29-17) Low-level viral replication in the presence of ART, however, increases the risk of developing ART resistance[.339,340](#page-29-18)

The occurrence of an AIDS-defining illness or a decline in CD4 count in a patient who had demonstrated clinical improvement after initiating ART suggests a need to change treatment. Some patients who initiate ART demonstrate no clinical improvement and a high viral load after good adherence to a sufficient course of ART (e.g., 6 months), suggesting infection with an HIV drugresistant strain.

#### **How to Change (Switch) ART**

If genotypic or phenotypic antiretroviral resistance testing is available, clinicians should optimize regimens according to those results.[272](#page-28-1) Resistance testing should be obtained while the patient is taking the failing antiretroviral regimen or shortly after treatment discontinuation. In resource-limited settings, if the first-line regimen consisted of two NRTIs combined with an NNRTI, a reasonable second-line regimen would consist of a ritonavir-boosted protease inhibitor combined with two new NRTIs. For children <3 years of age failing first-line ART containing a protease inhibitor, a switch to second line with two NNRTIs plus raltegravir is recommended[.275](#page-28-3) Importantly, for HIV-infected patients who have chronic active HBV, the second-line and subsequent regimens should maintain two antiretrovirals with activity against HBV.

#### **ART for Children**

For perinatally infected children, ART should be started as soon as possible; without treatment, over 50% of HIV-infected infants progress to AIDS and death by 2 years of age. Pre-emptive ART initiation may be required in infants with a presumptive diagnosis of severe HIV disease[,275](#page-28-3) as access to appropriate infant diagnostics may not be available (see "[HIV Diagnosis](#page-16-1)" earlier)[.341](#page-29-19) In all settings, pediatric ART has been complicated by limited availability of child-friendly formulations (e.g., liquid products), long-term toxicities of ARVs, and potential for transmitted HIV drug resistance due to exposure to maternal antiretroviral drugs taken for PMTCT.

Perinatally infected children can be at greater risk of infection with strains of HIV that have primary resistance to antiretrovirals that the mother has taken for PMTCT. Treating all HIV-infected pregnant and breastfeeding women with lifelong ART decreases the risk for transmitting drug-resistant infection, but mounting evidence suggests suboptimal adherence during these periods[.342,343](#page-29-20) Drug resistance can also emerge in HIV-infected children administered extended prophylaxis with nevirapine (with or without concomitant zidovudine) during breastfeedin[g344,345](#page-29-21) or if exposed to antiretroviral drugs through breastfeeding.[346](#page-29-22) Regardless of PMTCT exposure, studies have demonstrated improved outcomes with LPV/r-containing ART in infants, so the WHO recommends an LPV/r-based first-line regimen for all HIV-infected children younger than 3 years[.275,347](#page-28-3)

#### **PREVENTION OF OPPORTUNISTIC INFECTIONS**

# <span id="page-21-0"></span>**Special Considerations for Antimicrobial Prophylaxis in Resource-Limited Settings**

(Note: Isoniazid prophylaxis is discussed in [Chapter 31.1.](#page--1-0))

#### Trimethoprim–Sulfamethoxazole/Cotrimoxazole

In resource-limited settings, daily prophylaxis with trimethoprim– sulfamethoxazole (cotrimoxazole) in adults and children reduces the incidence of pneumonia, diarrhea, malaria, and bacterial bloodstream infection[s348–351](#page-29-23) and reduces mortality in areas with high prevalences of malaria[330](#page-29-12) and in persons with both HIV and active TB.[349](#page-29-24) Cotrimoxazole prophylaxis is also beneficial for persons initiating ART.[352–354](#page-29-25) The intervention has additional benefits in pregnant women and reduces the rate of low birth weight in newborns[.355](#page-29-26)

In 2014 the WHO released updated guidelines on the use of cotrimoxazole prophylaxis for HIV-infected persons, strongly recommending cotrimoxazole prophylaxis for HIV-infected persons, including children and pregnant women[.356](#page-30-0) Cotrimoxazole prophylaxis increases pill burden and costs modestly, but is well tolerated and is cost-effective[.357–359](#page-30-1) It creates selection pressure leading to cotrimoxazole-resistant infections among a small number of individuals[360](#page-30-2); however, its use has been associated with decreases in overall rates of sulfa-resistant malaria[.361](#page-30-3) Cotrimoxazole prophylaxis against *Pneumocystis* pneumonia can be safely discontinued in individuals who maintain CD4 cell counts >200 cells/µL for >3 months[.116](#page-24-36) It is less clear whether cotrimoxazole in resourcelimited settings should be discontinued; a marked increase in the risk of malaria and diarrheal disease after its discontinuation has been demonstrated[.362](#page-30-4)

#### Fluconazole and Itraconazole

Primary prophylaxis with fluconazole or itraconazole may be beneficial in countries with a high prevalence of azole-susceptible fungal opportunistic illness (e.g. cryptococcosis, talaromycosis).[250](#page-27-25) Fluconazole prophylaxis has been shown to reduce the incidence of cryptococcal disease and candidiasis in adults with advanced HIV disease, particularly those with CD4 counts <50–100 cells/µl,[132,363–368](#page-25-7) and improves survival[.368](#page-30-5) Because of possible teratogenicity, women prescribed azoles should take effective birth control.[369](#page-30-6)

#### Non-Tuberculosis Anti-Mycobacterials (*Mycobacterium avium* Complex)

Prophylaxis against *Mycobacterium avium* complex (MAC) is recommended in developed countries for HIV-infected adults with CD4 cell counts <50 cell/µL[.116](#page-24-36) The organism is ubiquitous in the environment worldwide[.370–372](#page-30-7) However, MAC infections have not emerged as a substantial cause of disease in HIV-infected persons outside of North and South America and Europe. Primary prophylaxis against MAC is not addressed in WHO guidelines.

#### **CHRONIC PRIMARY CARE CONSIDERATIONS**

# Non-Communicable Diseases

As the uptake of ART increases in low- and middle-income countries, survival of HIV-infected persons will improve likely to the same extent as currently noted in industrialized nations[.373–375](#page-30-8) AIDS-related opportunistic illnesses will decline,[376](#page-30-9) and noncommunicable diseases (NCDs) will become increasingly prevalent.[377–383](#page-30-10) For persons who have access to and who adhere to ART, HIV becomes a chronic disease with chronic co-morbidities. These chronic conditions include but are not limited to cardiovascular disease,[384](#page-30-11) depression[,385–387](#page-30-12) cancers,[388,389](#page-30-13) metabolic abnormalities, diabetes, and lipodystrophy.[390,391](#page-30-14) The increased prevalence of NCDs among HIV-infected adults reflects a combination of factors, including aging, greater prevalence of traditional risk factors (e.g., smoking), direct consequences of HIV infection, and exposure to specific components of ART[.392–403](#page-30-15) Therefore HIV-infected persons should be diligently screened for chronic conditions and promptly treated. Smoking cessation is among the most cost-effective interventions for reducing long-term morbidity and mortality for HIV-infected persons.[404](#page--1-1)

Mental health conditions, such as depression and substance abuse, reduce quality of life and present challenges to adherence and retention in care.[405](#page--1-2) Where feasible, supportive counseling, medication, and referral to specialists or specialized treatment programs should be provided.[406](#page--1-3)

#### Vaccinations

Vaccination guidelines for international travel and primary prophylaxis are available.[366,407–409](#page-30-16) Safety is a concern with some live virus vaccines, and their use should be avoided, especially in persons with CD4 cell counts <200 cells/µL. Generally, vaccinations are more immunogenic in persons with higher CD4 cell counts. For persons in whom immune reconstitution is anticipated and vaccine resources are limited, vaccination can be deferred until the CD4 cell count has improved (e.g., ≥200 cells/µL). Persons with low CD4 cell counts can be vaccinated at entry to care and then reassessed once their CD4 cell count has improved and be revaccinated if warranted.

#### Nutrition

Food insecurity, inadequate energy intake, malnutrition, and specific micronutrient deficiencies are endemic in many areas with high HIV prevalence[.410–413](#page--1-4) For patients whose expected lifespan has increased significantly, dietary counseling and exercise promotion are indicated, as increased rates of obesity have been noted[.414](#page--1-5)

#### **PRIMARY HIV PREVENTION**

Comprehensive, sustained prevention programs can reduce HIV transmission[415](#page--1-6); however, interventions do not reach most people at risk. Successful behavioral interventions engage high-risk populations and offer educational messages coupled with prevention skills, such as how to negotiate condom use and how to refuse sex.

HIV testing is an important component of primary HIV prevention. Thirty percent of all people living with HIV worldwide are unaware of their status.[416](#page--1-7) Offering opt-out HIV testing in most clinical settings has been widely recommended. Couples testing and counseling are acceptable in high-risk populations, such as serodiscordant couples[.238](#page-27-11) Couples testing can be linked to ART of an HIV-infected partner, which can reduce transmission to the HIV-negative partner by as much as 96% through suppression of viral load[.243,244,417](#page-27-26)

A safe and effective HIV vaccine would be a major advance and is the subject of intense research efforts.[418](#page--1-8) Male circumcision reduces a man's risk of acquiring HIV heterosexually by 50% to 60%[.41–43](#page-23-10) In high-prevalence areas where a large fraction of the regional population is uncircumcised, large-scale implementation of male circumcision has the potential to prevent many new infections.

Interventions that women can control, such as vaginal microbicides containing antiretrovirals, have shown early promise (39% reduction in HIV incidence[\)419](#page--1-9) and are under investigation. Daily oral administration of antiretroviral drugs to high-risk, HIVnegative individuals, termed *pre-exposure prophylaxis*, has been demonstrated to prevent HIV infection among men who have sex with men, and heterosexuals[.420–423](#page--1-10) Higher levels of protection were observed with more consistent use of pre-exposure prophylaxis in these trials. The WHO recommends pre-exposure prophylaxis for all persons at substantial risk of HIV[.275](#page-28-3)

Daily oral administration of antiretroviral regimens within 72 hours of isolated sexual, injection drug use, needle stick, or other HIV exposure is known as *post-exposure prophylaxis*. Treatment should continue for 28 days, regardless of the severity of exposure.[424](#page--1-11) A case-control study demonstrating an 81% reduction in the odds of HIV transmission among health care workers with percutaneous exposure to HIV who received zidovudine (ZDV) prophylaxis was the first to describe the efficacy of post-exposure prophylaxis.[425](#page--1-12) Because of the ethical and operational challenges, no randomized controlled trials have been conducted to test the efficacy of post-exposure prophylaxis directly. In the absence of a randomized controlled trial for this case-control study reports the strongest evidence of benefit of antiretroviral prophylaxis initiated after HIV exposure among humans.

#### **Prevention of Gender-Based Violence**

Gender-based violence refers to violence directed against a person because of his or her gender and expectations of his or her role in a society or culture. Women are disproportionately affected by violence and gender inequalities, rendering violence against women a significant public health problem[.426](#page--1-13) In countries with high HIV prevalence, violence against women is common, and studies have shown that women who experience violence, sexual or physical, are at higher risk of acquiring HIV[.427](#page--1-14) Therefore addressing violence is necessary to curtail the HIV epidemic. There is a clear need to scale up efforts across a range of sectors, both for violence prevention and to provide necessary services for women experiencing violence.[426](#page--1-13)

#### **Prevention With Positives**

Interventions that help people with HIV maintain their health and reduce their risk of transmitting, often termed *prevention with positives*, play a critical role in HIV prevention.[238](#page-27-11) Maintaining a suppressed plasma HIV viral load reduces their infectiousness to others. Use of male and female condoms and clean needles for people who inject drugs prevents exposure of uninfected persons to HIV and reduces the likelihood that an HIV-infected person could become infected with a resistant strain of HIV (termed *superinfection*). Encouraging patients to reduce their number of sexual partners, to disclose their HIV status, to encourage their partners to be tested, and to use lubrication during intercourse can further reduce HIV transmission risk. Screening and treating for sexually transmitted infections may reduce their infectiousness to others.[143](#page-25-12)

### **PALLIATIVE CARE**

Although there has been a 27% decline in the number of AIDSrelated deaths worldwide from 2010 to 2015, an estimated 1.1 million AIDS-related deaths still occurred in 2015[.1](#page-22-0) Palliative care focuses on improving the quality of life of patients with lifethreatening illnesses and helping patients live as actively as possible until death.[428](#page--1-15) Palliative care can be offered throughout the course of HIV infection, not only at end-of-life situations. It can be provided in a health care setting or at home by family and community caregivers. Important goals are: (1) to provide relief from pain and other distressing symptoms (i.e., diarrhea, nausea, shortness of breath), which can be common with advanced HIV disease and opportunistic infections; and (2) to provide support for the psychological, social, spiritual, and cultural needs of the patient and family, including bereavement care. Detailed guidelines on palliative care have been developed by the WHO.[429](#page--1-16)
