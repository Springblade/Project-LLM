# KEY FEATURES

- • *Mansonella perstans*, *M. ozzardi*, and *M. streptocerca* are *Mansonella* species that infect humans.
- • *Mansonella* species vary considerably in their geographic distribution and in the location of adult and larval parasites in the host.
- • Despite a high prevalence of infection in endemic areas, clinical manifestations of *Mansonella* infections are uncommon.
- • *Dirofilaria* infection is a worldwide zoonosis spread by mosquitoes.
- • The most common presentation of *Dirofilaria immitis* (dog heartworm) infection in humans is an asymptomatic coin lesion seen on chest radiography.
- • Responses of *Mansonella* and *Dirofilaria* parasites to anti-filarial treatment vary by species.

#### **MANSONELLA PERSTANS INFECTION**

#### **Introduction**

Microfilariae of the filarial parasite *Mansonella perstans* (synonyms: *Dipetalonema perstans, Acanthocheilonema perstans, Tetrapetalonema perstans*) were first described in the blood of an African by Manson in 1891; in 1898, the adult parasite was extracted from the mesentery of an Amerindian in Guyana[.1](#page-5-0) Generally believed to cause little pathology and, until recently, refractory to anti-filarial chemotherapy, *M. perstans* has been understudied.

### **Epidemiology**

*M. perstans* is endemic throughout much of tropical Africa, especially in the region from Senegal east to Uganda and south to Zimbabwe; in South America it is endemic along the Atlantic coast from Panama to Argentina. Minor foci have been identified in Algeria and Tunisia. Although the number of people infected with *M. perstans* is unknown, 33 countries in Africa (total population 580 million) have reported indigenous cases[,2](#page-5-1) and the prevalence of microfilaremia may reach 100% in highly endemic areas[.3](#page-5-2) Infection of travelers is rare[.4](#page-5-3) Non-human primates (gorillas and chimpanzees) can harbor *M. perstans,* but do not appear to be a major reservoir of infection.

### **Natural History, Pathogenesis, and Pathology**

*M. perstans* is transmitted by biting midges of the genus *Culicoides,* of which the species *C. milnei* and *C. grahamii* are the most important. Infected larvae penetrate the skin and develop over 9 to 12 months into adult worms that inhabit the pleural, peritoneal, and pericardial cavities, as well as the mesentery, perirenal, and retroperitoneal tissues.[5](#page-5-4) Microfilariae of *M. perstans* are small, unsheathed [\(Fig. 117.1;](#page-1-0) [Table 117.1](#page-1-1)), and circulate in the blood without periodicity. Some, but not all, isolates of *M. perstans* harbor the bacterial endosymbiont *Wolbachia.*[6–8](#page-5-5)

# **Clinical Features**

Although most patients with *M. perstans* infection are asymptomatic, clinical manifestations include transient subcutaneous swellings similar to the Calabar swellings of loiasis, urticaria, pruritus, arthralgia, abdominal pain, and fatigue. Serositis, including pleuritis and pericarditis; meningoencephalitis; neuropsychiatric disturbances; hepatitis; granulomatous nodules in the conjunctiva; retinal lesions; and periorbital inflammation surrounding dead adult worms (*bung-eye* or *bulge-eye*) have been described. Eosinophilia and elevated serum IgE levels are common.[9](#page-5-6)

# **Patient Evaluation, Diagnosis, and Differential Diagnosis**

The diagnosis of *M. perstans* infection is usually made when microfilariae are detected incidentally in the peripheral blood. Infection should also be considered in individuals with a history of prolonged residence in an endemic area who present with unexplained eosinophilia and/or any of the typical clinical signs and symptoms. Anti-filarial antibody testing is generally positive; however, commercially available tests do not distinguish between filarial species or between active infection, past infection, and exposure. Microfilariae can be seen in thick blood smears stained with Giemsa or Wright's stain; concentration techniques are useful in patients with low numbers of circulating microfilariae. Speciesspecific polymerase chain reaction (PCR)–based diagnostics are more sensitive than blood filtration, but are available only in research settings. Rarely, adult worms are recovered intact or appear in histologic sections.

#### **Treatment**

*M. perstans* infection is relatively refractory to most anti-filarial therapies, including diethylcarbamazine (DEC), ivermectin, and albendazole[10](#page-5-7). In one study comparing the efficacy of multiple regimens, the best efficacy (37% microfilarial clearance at 1 month) was seen with a combination of DEC and mebendazole administered for 21 days[.10](#page-5-7) Doxycycline (200 mg daily for 6 weeks), which has activity against the intra-cellular endosymbiont *Wolbachia,* was 100% effective in clearing *M. perstans* microfilariae from the blood of infected subjects in Mali for up to 36 months[,11](#page-5-8) but would not be expected to have efficacy in areas where *M. perstans* does not harbor *Wolbachia.*

#### **MANSONELLA OZZARDI INFECTION**

#### **Introduction**

In 1897, Manson first described microfilariae in the blood of Amerindians in Guyana[.12](#page-5-9) He named the species *Filaria ozzardi* after Ozzard, who obtained the specimens. In 1929 Faust named the new genus *Mansonella.*

#### **Epidemiology**

*M. ozzardi* is restricted to Central America, South America (Colombia, Venezuela, Guyana, Suriname, Brazil, Argentina,

<span id="page-1-0"></span>Bolivia), and the Caribbean islands (Puerto Rico, Antigua, Guadeloupe, Nevis, Dominican Republic, Haiti, Martinique, St. Kitts, St. Lucia, St. Vincent, and Trinidad). Although the total number of people infected with *M. ozzardi* is unknown, the prevalence of microfilaremia may reach 70% in highly endemic villages. Infection of travelers is uncommon.[4](#page-5-3) Humans are the only major reservoir of infection.

#### **Natural History, Pathogenesis, and Pathology**

*M. ozzardi* is transmitted by biting midges of the genus *Culicoides* as well as by the black fly, *Simulium amazonicum.* Larvae penetrate the skin and develop over months to years into adult worms that are found in the thoracic and peritoneal cavities, and have been described in the lymphatics. Only a fragment of a male worm from humans has been identified. Microfilariae are small, unsheathed [\(Fig. 117.2](#page-2-0); see [Table 117.1\)](#page-1-1), and circulate without periodicity in the skin and blood[.13](#page-5-10) *M. ozzardi* harbors the bacterial endosymbiont *Wolbachia.*[14](#page-5-11)

# **Clinical Features**

Although most patients with *M. ozzardi* infection are asymptomatic,[15](#page-5-12) clinical manifestations include urticaria, pruritic skin eruptions, edema, lymphadenopathy, articular pains, fever, headache, vertigo, and pulmonary symptoms. Nummular keratitis has been reported in association with *M. ozzardi* infection in Brazil.[16](#page-5-13) Peripheral eosinophilia is common.

# **Patient Evaluation, Diagnosis, and Differential Diagnosis**

*M. ozzardi* infection should be considered in individuals with appropriate exposure and who present with unexplained eosinophilia and/or any of the clinical signs and symptoms. Definitive diagnosis can be made by demonstration of microfilariae in the blood (see Chapter 115) or in skin snips (see Chapter 116), although morphologic distinction from *Onchocerca volvulus* in the skin is difficult.[17](#page-5-14) Serology is not species specific and does not differentiate between exposure and infection. PCR-based diagnostics are available only in research settings.

#### **Treatment**

DEC and albendazole appear ineffective in the treatmen[t18;](#page-5-15) however, resolution of clinical symptoms and reduction of microfilarial levels has been demonstrated with ivermectin[.19–21](#page-5-16) The efficacy of doxycycline in treating infection with *Wolbachia*-containing *M. ozzardi* has not been studied.

# **STREPTOCERCIASIS (MANSONELLA STREPTOCERCA)**

### **Introduction**

In 1922 Macfie and Corson described microfilariae in the skin of Ghanaians that were morphologically distinct from *O. volvulus.*[22](#page-5-17) Adult male and female worms of *Mansonella streptocerca* were not

demonstrated in humans until 1972 and 1975, respectively[.23](#page-5-18) The clinical significance of streptocerciasis is likely underestimated due to overlap in symptomatology and geographic distribution with onchocerciasis.

#### **Epidemiology**

Streptocerciasis is limited to the tropical rainforests of western and central Africa, including northern Angola, Cameroon, Central African Republic, People's Republic of Congo, Equatorial Guinea, Nigeria, and the Democratic Republic of Congo, and a small focus in western Uganda[.24](#page-5-19) Prevalence rates vary widely, but can reach 90% focally. Infection of travelers is uncommon.[4](#page-5-3) Although natural infection of non-human primates occurs, their importance as reservoirs is unknown.

# **Natural History, Pathogenesis, and Pathology**

*M. streptocerca* is transmitted by the biting midge, *C. grahamii.* Larvae penetrate the skin and develop over months to years into adult worms that live in the dermis of the upper trunk and shoulder girdle. Dermal microfilariae are small, unsheathed, and characterized by a sharp curving of the posterior end that frequently gives them a shepherd's crook configuration ([Fig. 117.3](#page-3-0); see [Table 117.1](#page-1-1)). There are no published data on the presence of *Wolbachia* in *M. streptocerca.*

#### **Clinical Features**

The clinical manifestations of streptocerciasis appear to be restricted to the skin and lymph nodes.[25](#page-5-20) Although infection is often asymptomatic, the most common complaint is chronic pruritus, most pronounced over the shoulder girdle and thorax. Characteristic findings include dermal thickening, non-anesthetic hypopigmented macules, and axillary or inguinal adenopathy. Occasionally, papules may be present. Peripheral blood eosinophilia is common.

# **Patient Evaluation, Diagnosis, and Differential Diagnosis**

*M. streptocerca* infection should be considered in individuals with an exposure history who present with pruritus, a macular hypopigmented rash, or bilateral inguinal or axillary adenopathy. Diagnosis is made by identification of microfilariae from skin snips or biopsies (see Chapter 116). PCR is more sensitive than standard techniques.[26](#page-5-21) As in other *Mansonella* infections, serology is not helpful. Skin histology may be necessary to distinguish *M. streptocerca* macular lesions from those of early leprosy.

#### **Treatment**

DEC (6 mg/kg/day) for 14 to 21 days kills both microfilariae and adult worms, but can be accompanied by a transient (24–48 hours) exacerbation of clinical symptoms, including pruritus, papular eruptions ([Fig. 117.4](#page-3-1)), urticaria, arthralgias, myalgias, fever, headache, nausea, and vomiting. These effects can be managed symptomatically with antihistamines and anti-inflammatory agents. Ivermectin (150 µg/kg as a single dose) reduces *M. streptocerca* microfilarial levels,[27](#page-5-22) but is not macrofilaridal. The use of doxycycline has not been explored.

#### **DIROFILARIASIS**

### **Introduction**

Dirofilariasis, infection caused by filarial nematodes of the genus *Dirofilaria,* is the most common zoonotic filariasis. Human dirofilariasis was first described in 1885. Unlike other filarial infections of humans, which are restricted to the tropics and

subtropics, dirofilariasis has a worldwide distribution. Two distinct clinical forms are recognized: pulmonary dirofilariasis, caused by the dog heartworm, *Dirofilaria immitis,* and subcutaneous dirofilariasis, caused by a variety of species, including *D. tenuis* and *D. repens.*

### **Epidemiology**

The true incidence and geographic distribution of human dirofilariasis are unknown[.28](#page-5-23) Human infection is determined by the prevalence of infection in the natural host and the extent to which humans are exposed to the mosquito vectors. Pulmonary dirofilariasis has a cosmopolitan distribution with cases reported from North and South America, Australia, Japan, South Africa, and Europe. Subcutaneous dirofilariasis has been reported worldwide.

#### **Natural History, Pathogenesis, and Pathology**

*Dirofilaria* are transmitted to their natural hosts by mosquito vectors. The location of the adult worms and microfilariae varies depending on the species. All *Dirofilaria* examined to date harbor the bacterial endosymbiont *Wolbachia.*[28](#page-5-23)

#### Pulmonary Dirofilariasis

<span id="page-3-1"></span>Although *D. immitis* infects the cat, fox, wolf, coyote, sea lion, and other mammals, the dog is the most important reservoir. Coiled masses of adult worms inhabit the right ventricle and produce microfilariae, which are taken up by the mosquito vector in a blood meal. In human infection, parasites likely develop partially in the right ventricle before dying and being swept into small pulmonary arteries. Neither mature adult worms nor microfilaria have been found in humans.

# Subcutaneous Dirofilariasis

Most subconjunctival dirofilarial infections in humans in North America are due to *D. tenuis,* a raccoon parasite, and in Europe, Africa, and Asia, due to *D. repens,* a dog and cat parasite. Rare cases of subconjunctival disease due to *D. immitis* have been reported in Asia and Australia. Other species identified as causes of human subcutaneous infection are *D. striata,* a parasite of wildcats, and *D. ursi,* a parasite of bears. Humans are not a definitive host for these parasites, and although occasionally gravid worms have been identified, microfilariae have not been detected.

#### **Clinical Features**

# Pulmonary Dirofilariasis

Pulmonary dirofilariasis typically presents as asymptomatic coin lesions on routine chest radiography [\(Fig. 117.5\)](#page-4-0). Lesions are most often solitary, 1 to 3 cm in diameter, sharply defined, and located in the periphery of the lung. When symptoms do occur, they are cough, hemoptysis, fever, chills, and malaise.

#### Subcutaneous Dirofilariasis

The most dramatic presentation of subcutaneous dirofilariasis is the presence of a moving adult worm in the conjunctiva ([Fig. 117.6](#page-4-1)). This is often accompanied by swelling of the eyelid and face and a burning sensation. Occasionally, worms are found in the retina or within the eye and present as eye pain and blurred vision. Subcutaneous lesions in other parts of the body present as small (0.5–1.5 cm), painless nodules that develop over days to weeks and may or may not be painful, erythematous,

**Fig. 117.5** Roentgenogram of "coin lesion" 2.5 by 2.0 cm, in right lung. (Courtesy, Armed Forces Institute of Pathology, Photograph Neg. No.72–10156.)

and accompanied by a feeling of movement. Systemic signs are unusual. The most common locations are the eyelid, scrotum, breast, arm, and leg, although any part of the body can be involved.

# **Patient Evaluation, Diagnosis, and Differential Diagnosis**

Pulmonary dirofilariasis should be considered in patients with a coin lesion on radiography without risk factors or clinical findings suggestive of malignancy. Rarely, subcutaneous dirofilariasis can mimic a localized tumor.[29,30](#page-5-24) Definitive diagnosis is made by identification of the worm in a biopsy or autopsy specimen. Filarial serology may be positive or negative, is not species specific, and is rarely helpful in establishing a diagnosis.

Histopathology reveals a central zone of necrosis surrounded by granulomatous inflammation and a fibrous wall. A single, coiled, usually necrotic and sometimes calcified worm is found in the lumen of an artery within the area of necrosis (pulmonary

dirofilariasis) or in a subcutaneous abscess [\(Fig. 117.7\)](#page-4-2). Morphologic features that help in the identification of dirofilaria in tissue sections are their relatively large size (100–350 µm in diameter), a thick cuticle, and abundant musculature. Species-specific PCR can identify and differentiate between *Dirofilaria* species in tissues.[31](#page-5-25)

#### **Treatment**

The only known treatment is surgical removal of the worm, as has often occurred during the diagnostic workup. Removal of the worm is not essential, however, except in cases where ongoing inflammation is likely to cause permanent damage (for example, a worm inside the anterior chamber of the eye). Most worms die without treatment and are absorbed without clinical sequelae.
