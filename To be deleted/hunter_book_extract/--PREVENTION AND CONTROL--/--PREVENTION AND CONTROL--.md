triclabendazole 10 mg/kg for two doses at 12-hour intervals and artesunate 4 mg/kg once a day for 10 days for the treatment of acute fascioliasis in Vietnam. Artesunate-treated patients were significantly more likely to be free of abdominal pain at discharge but were less likely to be symptom-free 3 months after treatment (76% vs. 92%)[.8](#page-0-0) Surgical resection or ERCP removal of adult flukes can be done in cases with biliary tract obstruction.

# **PREVENTION AND CONTROL**

Proper cooking or cleaning of aquatic plants before consumption will prevent *Fasciola* infection. In endemic areas, mass chemotherapy of infected animals and proper sanitary protection of pastures are important control measures.

# **128.3** Dicroceliasis and Eurytremiasis

*Kittiyod Poovorawan, Yupaporn Wattanagoon*

## **INTRODUCTION**

Dicroceliasis and eurytremiasis are caused by the liver flukes *Dicrocoelium dendriticum* and *Eurytrema pancreaticum* [\(Fig. 128.3.1](#page-0-1)). Herbivorous animals such as sheep, goats, and cattle are the natural host. Humans are accidental hosts.

# **EPIDEMIOLOGY**

Dicroceliasis is common in animals in Europe, northern Africa, and parts of the Far East, and is less common in North and South America. Several human cases have been reported, mainly from Europe and Africa.[1](#page-1-0)

*E. pancreaticum* has been reported from autopsies in China and Japan[.2](#page-1-1) Animal infections occur in cattle, water buffalo, sheep, and goats in Asia and occasionally in camels and monkeys in northern China, Brazil, Venezuela, and Madagascar.

# **NATURAL HISTORY, PATHOGENESIS, AND PATHOLOGY**

Humans acquire dicroceliasis after ingestion of food contaminated with infected ants of the species *Formica fusa,* the second intermediate host. Acquisition of eurytremiasis follows eating food contaminated with infected grasshoppers or crickets, the second intermediate host. In both infections, metacercaria excyst in the duodenum and migrate through the ampula of Vater. For

dicroceliasis, they move retrograde to the bile ducts where they develop into adult worms. In eurytremiasis, they move retrograde to the pancreatic duct and, rarely, the bile ducts, where they develop into adult worms. Pathologic changes are similar to those of *Opisthorchis* infections.

### **CLINICAL FEATURES**

There have been few documented cases of human infection. In dicroceliasis, dyspepsia, abdominal pain, flatulence, and watery diarrhea have been reported.[3](#page-1-2) In eurytremiasis, symptoms include abdominal distress, dyspepsia, vomiting, and diarrhea. Occasionally jaundice and an enlarged, tender liver have been documented.

### **DIAGNOSIS**

Demonstration of ova of each species in fecal specimens is diagnostic. Spurious infection should be suspected if patients have a history of raw sheep liver consumption[.1](#page-1-0) Similar to fascioliasis, for confirmation, patients should be put on a liver-free diet for 3 days and a repeat stool examination performed.

## **TREATMENT**

No therapeutic trials have been conducted. Praziquantel 25 mg/ kg three times a day for 1 day and triclabendazole 10 mg/kg as a single dose after a meal have both been used successfully in a single case treatment of dicroceliasis[.3](#page-1-2) Most cases of eurytremiasis have been successfully treated with praziquantel 25 mg/kg three times a day for 1 day.
