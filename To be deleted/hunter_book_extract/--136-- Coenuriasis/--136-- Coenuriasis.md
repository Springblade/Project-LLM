# **136** Coenuriasis

*Francesca Schiaffino, Robert H. Gilman*

### KEY FEATURES

- • Coenuriasis is a common zoonosis with rare human infections.
- • In humans, infection is caused by the larval stage of the tapeworm *Taenia multiceps* and *T. serialis* after ingestion of the tapeworm egg.
- • Typically a single space-occupying lesion, the coenuriasis, is found subcutaneously, in the eye, or in the central nervous system (CNS).
- • The coenurus is a thin-walled cyst filled with clear fluid with small scolexes attached to the cyst wall.
- • Treatment is usually surgical excision combined with antiparasitic medication: praziquantel or albendazole.

### **INTRODUCTION**

Coenuriasis is a rare zoonotic disease caused by the metacestode (larval) stage of the parasites *Taenia multiceps* and, less frequently, *T. serialis.* Both organisms are common parasites of small ruminants, lagomorphs, and other small mammals but are rare in humans.

#### **EPIDEMIOLOGY**

*T. multiceps* is widely distributed in temperate areas. Animal coenuriasis is common across Africa, the Middle East, and some Asian countries, yet is seldom reported in Europe and the United States. Prevalence is varied and depends on the climate and type of animal rearing practices[.1](#page-1-0) Human cases of coenuriasis have been reported in the United States, England, France, Italy, Israel, India, and other locations in Africa and the Middle East. Molecular studies have recently elucidated a common lineage of *T. multiceps* in Europe.[2,3](#page-1-1)

Dogs and other canids are the definitive hosts of the tapeworms of *T. multiceps,* whereas small ruminants and other mammals act as intermediary hosts, where the metacestode causes a disease named *gid* or *staggers*.

*T. serialis* is also widely distributed in temperate regions; cases have been reported in Canada, the United States, France, the Middle East, and some countries in Africa. Dogs and foxes are the definitive hosts of *T. serialis,* and lagomorphs are intermediary hosts. Humans act as accidental intermediate hosts of both tapeworm species, due to fecal–oral transmission of eggs[.4–11](#page-1-2)

#### **NATURAL HISTORY, PATHOGENESIS, AND PATHOLOGY**

For both *T. multiceps* and *T. serialis,* gravid proglottids (eggs) are excreted to the environment in feces of canids. These are ingested by intermediary hosts (either animals or humans). Within the gastrointestinal system, onchospheres hatch and penetrate the wall of the small intestine and travel through the bloodstream to solid organs. In humans, coenuri of *T. multiceps* are generally found in the central nervous system, whereas with *T. serialis,* coenuri are more commonly found in subcutaneous connective tissue and muscles.[12](#page-1-3)

The coenurus has a thin wall surrounding a single cavity that contains a clear fluid. Numerous scolexes of 3 mm in diameter attach to the cyst wall, and unlike the unilocular hydatid cyst of *Echinococcus granulosus,* no brood capsules are found [\(Fig.](#page-0-0) [136.1](#page-0-0)). Each scolex has four circular suckers and two rows of large and small hooks on a rostellum. The hook lengths for *T. multiceps* are 150 to 170 µm and 90 to 130 µm; those for *T. serialis* are 135 to 175 µm and 68 to 120 µm.[5](#page-1-4) The handles of large hooks tend to end bluntly. In cerebral stages, the handles of small hooks are usually curved and rarely straight. For a more detailed analysis of the morphology of coenuriasis see Christodoulopoulos et al. 2016[.13](#page-1-5)

#### **CLINICAL FEATURES**

Patients with coenuriasis usually have a space-occupying lesion caused by a single cyst 2 to 6 cm in diameter; cysts up to 10 cm have been reported[.8](#page-1-6) Coenuri in the central nervous system (CNS) have been found in the cerebrum, leptomeninges, ventricles, posterior horn of the lateral ventricle, brainstem, and spinal cord and among the cranial nerves. Subcutaneous coenuri are found in the intercostal region and anterior abdominal wall. They have also been reported in the breast, axilla, lumbar spine, peritoneal cavity, and extremities. These cysts resemble a lipoma, ganglion, or neurofibroma. Ocular coenuri have occurred in the vitreous, anterior chamber, and conjunctiva[.14](#page-1-7)

The clinical manifestations of neurocoenuriasis are similar to those of neurocysticercosis. In cerebral cases these include headache, vomiting, papilledema, meningeal symptoms, and seizures, as well as focal neurologic deficits and hemiparesis[.4,15](#page-1-2)

Cystic lesions in the CNS and other organs can be visualized with x-ray, ultrasonography, or more commonly with computed tomography (CT) scans and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). On CT scans, cysts are seen as a lucent area surrounded by a contrast-enhancing rim ([Fig. 136.2](#page-1-8)). Older, sterile lesions appear calcified on CT. On MRI, cyst fluid resembles cerebrospinal fluid, appearing dark in T1-weighted images and bright in T2-weighted images[.12](#page-1-3) Subcutaneous coenuri can be palpated, and ocular coenuri can be observed by ophthalmologic examination.

Definitive diagnosis generally rests on surgical excision followed by microscopic identification. Diagnosis has been made after fine needle aspiration followed by microscopy. Serology can be used to rule out the more common *T. solium* and *E. granulosus* infections; however, false-positive results for *T. solium* or *E. granulosus* can occur. Polymerase chain reaction of cytochrome C oxidase subunit I, as well as 12S ribosomal DNA (12S rRNA) genes, has been successfully used.[16](#page-1-9) Other techniques include high-resolution melting analysis and sequencing.[4,17](#page-1-2) Early diagnosis of coenuriasis in animals remains a challenge. An indirect enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay using the recombinant protein TmGP50 has been reported as a potential marker in goats.[18](#page-1-10)

#### **TREATMENT**

Patients are treated with a combination of surgical intervention and antiparasitic drugs. Both praziquantel and albendazole are likely to be effective, as they are in treating cysticercosis[.4,8](#page-1-2) Praziquantel can lead to toxic endophthalmitis and loss of vision in intraocular coenuriasis. The best treatment of an intravitreal cestode cystic larva is its removal through a closed vitrectomy.[19](#page-1-11) Preventive measures include hygienic practices to reduce contact with dogs and to break the transmission of eggs from dog feces to humans.

Elimination of adult worms with praziquantel or niclosamide reduces environmental contamination with eggs. Experimental vaccination of sheep has proven successful and could lead to a halt in the life cycle of *T. multiceps.*[14](#page-1-7)
