# **121** Gnathostomiasis

*Paron Dekumyoy, Dorn Watthanakulpanich*

## KEY FEATURES

- • Human gnathostomiasis is also called Tau-cheed (Thailand), Yangtze River edema and Shanghai's rheumatism (China), Rangoon tumor (Myanmar), Woodbury bug (Australia), Chokofishi (Japan), and nodular migratory eosinophilic panniculitis or traveling cutaneous inflammation (Ecuador).
- • *Gnathostoma* species cause subcutaneous migratory swellings, piercing sensations, and, less commonly, ocular and central nervous system disease.
- • Gnathostomiasis is a food-borne parasitic zoonosis. Infection occurs after consumption of intermediate/ paratenic hosts, usually raw fish, shrimp, crab, frog, or chicken.
- • Treatment is surgical if the worm can be easily accessed, or medical with albendazole and/or ivermectin.

#### **INTRODUCTION**

Parasites of the genus *Gnathostoma* are nematode infections of cats and other carnivores. Five species are reported that affect humans: *Gnathostoma spinigerum* (the most common; Richard Owen, 1836); *G. hispidum* (Fedtschenko, 1872); *G. doloresi* (Tubangui, 1925); *G. nipponicum* (Yamaguti, 1941); and *G. binucleatum* (Almeyda-Artigas, 1991). Gnathostomiases have similar manifestations, including subcutaneous migratory swellings.

#### **EPIDEMIOLOGY**

Since 1889, patients infected with *G. spinigerum* ([Fig. 121.1\)](#page-1-0) have been reported in Thailand; *G. binucleatum* is currently in Mexico and other neighboring Latin American countries. *Gnathostoma hispidum, G. doleresi,* and *G. nipponicum* have been reported in Japan and China.[1](#page-1-1) A few gnathostomiasis cases have been reported from non-endemic countries, for example, *G. spinigerum* infection in Zambia, South Africa, and Brazil, and *G. hispidum* infection in Spain. It is likely that gnathostomiasis is under-reported in many Asian countries.

Definitive hosts for gnathostomiasis are dogs, cats, pigs, wild pigs, weasels, and other mammals[.1,2](#page-1-1) Several species of fish (found in fresh and brackish water), amphibians, reptiles, avians, and mammals act as intermediate hosts of both *G. spinigerum* and *G. binucleatum.* In Thailand, 48 species of vertebrates (including 20 species of freshwater fish) can serve as intermediate and/or paratenic hosts. In Mexico, 25 species of fish and seven species of fish-eating birds are intermediate hosts.

Human gnathostomiasis is found more frequently in adults than children, and in more females than males, with the exception of Vietnam where males are more frequently infected[.3,4](#page-1-2) Occupation, dietary habits, and social aspects affect the probability of infection. Patients as young as 3 days old have been reported, suggesting prenatal or perinatal transmission[.5,6](#page-2-0)

### **NATURAL HISTORY, PATHOGENESIS, AND PATHOLOGY**

Adult nematodes coil in the stomach muscles of the definitive host. Eggs are passed in feces and, when exposed to water, release larvae. These larvae are ingested by freshwater copepods that are ingested, in turn, by an intermediate host, where larvae invade and lodge in muscle. Humans acquire the parasite by consuming the second- or third-stage larvae from infected intermediate or paratenic hosts. In humans, larvae cannot develop into adult worms and will penetrate the stomach wall and migrate randomly within the human host. These larvae measure 2.5 to 12.5 mm. The incubation period, or the time between ingestion of a worm and the appearance of cutaneous manifestations, is usually 3 to 4 weeks, although it can be as long as several years. Untreated, the worm can live in humans for several years; therefore a long, asymptomatic interval can be followed by recurrence of symptoms.[7](#page-2-1)

The migrating worm produces several toxins (acetylcholine, hyaluronidase, proteolytic enzyme, and hemolytic substance). The pathologic picture of swelling and track-like necrosis is characterized by an intense cellular infiltration with neutrophils, mononuclear cells, plasma cells, and eosinophils. Eosinophilia can occur. The parasite can migrate to the ocular system and central nervous system (CNS), causing localized inflammation and destruction.

### **CLINICAL FEATURES**

The most common manifestation is intermittent, migratory swelling and erythematous edema in the skin and subcutaneous tissues. If the swelling is subcutaneous, there are usually signs of inflammation, redness, and piercing pain. The swelling is hard and non-pitting and lasts for days to 1 to 4 weeks before it disappears. Re-appearance of swelling can occur after an asymptomatic interval of 1 week to several months in a new location not far from the previous one ([Figs. 121.2](#page-1-3) and [121.3](#page-1-4)).

Patients can initially suffer from epigastric pain, nausea, or vomiting, which are likely caused by penetration of the gastric wall by the ingested larvae. Other features can be fever, liver tenderness, and pleuro-pulmonary involvement. Frequent coughing, hemoptysis, chest pain, dyspnea, pneumothorax, hematuria with or without renal pain, and granuloma formation in the peritoneal cavity can occur. With CNS invasion, eosinophilic meningitis or meningoencephalitis, subarachnoid, intracerebral or intraventricular hemorrhage, radiculopathy, paralysis, seizures, altered consciousness, coma, and death can occur.[1,6](#page-1-1) With ocular invasion, probably by migration of the worm along the optic nerves, there can be decreased visual acuity and blindness.

*G. binucleatum* has clinical features similar to *G. spinigerum* with the additional invasion of peripheral extremities, face, head, and possibly cardiac tissue[.8](#page-2-2)

Physical examination findings depend on the area of the body where the worms migrate, and vary between *Gnathostoma* species. In cases of *G. spinigerum* and *G. binucleatum,* the disease can persist in subcutaneous tissue with relapses over several years, whereas with *G. hispidum, G. nipponicum,* and *G. doloresi,* surface skin lesions spontaneously disappear within 3 months even without treatment. Peripheral blood leukocytosis with hyper-eosinophilia occurs in acute cases. The degree of eosinophilia (sometimes as high as 90%) does not correlate with clinical severity. In cerebral

gnathostomiasis, the cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) is usually bloody or xanthochromic and has a pleocytosis.[9](#page-2-3)

#### **PATIENT EVALUATION, DIAGNOSIS, AND DIFFERENTIAL DIAGNOSIS**

The initial evaluation should focus on characteristic clinical findings, travel or residence in a gnathostomiasis endemic area, and dietary history suggesting ingestion of undercooked intermediate or paratenic hosts. A Western blot analysis can detect a specific antibody to 24-kDa reactive band indicative of *G. spinigerum*. Eosinophilia in peripheral blood or CSF is often present; in one clinical series, 47% had eosinophilia[.7](#page-2-1) A routine stool examination should be performed to identify other parasites.

The differential diagnosis for cerebral, visceral, and cutaneous gnathostomiasis includes intracerebral tuberculosis, syphilis, lymphoma, eosinophilic meningitis or meningoencephalitis, intracranial hemorrhage, localized angioedema, and helminth infections of loiasis, *Spirurina* larvae, and baylisascariasis (roundworms of raccoons). Computed tomography, magnetic resonance imaging, and ultrasound can assist in the detection of gnathostomiasis, but serology should accompany imaging studies. Antibody detection using serum and/or CSF can be used to identify a specific IgG to a 24-kDa antigen from *G. spinigerum* larvae. This test is highly sensitive and specific.[11](#page-2-5) Recombinant antigens of *G. spinigerum* (matrix metalloproteinase–like protein and rGslic18) can detect IgG antibodies with over 90% sensitivity and 95% specificity[.12,13](#page-2-6)

### **TREATMENT**

Definitive therapy is surgical removal of the worms; however, this may not be practical in all cases and the worms may not be easily found. Extraction of superficial cutaneous *Gnathostoma* can be performed by needles or scratching[1](#page-1-1) ; surgery is needed for intravitreal gnathostomiasis. Albendazole (400 mg twice a day for 21–28 days) demonstrated a 90% to 94% cure rate for cutaneous gnathostomiasis[.14,15](#page-2-7) In albendazole- and/or ivermectin-treated patients, gnathostomes may move to the skin surface.[16,17](#page-2-8) Patients on a month of albendazole can experience nausea, headache, and vomiting and should be monitored for liver toxicity.

Ivermectin at 0.2 mg/kg given in a single dose is effective in killing third-stage larvae of *G. spinigerum,* with cure rates of 76%; repeated ivermectin used in relapsed cases demonstrates cure rates of nearly 100%.[18](#page-2-9) In one study, ivermectin at 0.2 mg/kg for 2 consecutive days demonstrated a cure rate of 100% with mild side effects.[19](#page-2-10) This dose of ivermectin can also be used if treatment with albendazole is unsuccessful.[20–22](#page-2-11) A combination of two drugs and supportive, symptomatic, and anti-inflammatory treatments is another option. Assessment of successful treatment can be done by following clinical symptoms, eosinophilia, and antibody levels. Following antibody levels for at least 1 year is recommended.

In CNS gnathostomiasis, corticosteroids can reduce CNS inflammation. Intensive neurologic care is important in critical cases; however, recurrence of symptoms is possible.
