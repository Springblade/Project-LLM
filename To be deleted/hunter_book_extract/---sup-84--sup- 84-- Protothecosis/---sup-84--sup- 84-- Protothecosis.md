*Ann M. Nelson, Ronald C. Neafie*

#### KEY FEATURES

- • Rare disease caused by achlorophyllic algae of the genus *Prototheca.*
- • Infection via direct contact with organism in environment, often associated with trauma.
- • Three clinical pathologic syndromes:
  - • Localized olecranon granulomatous bursitis in immunocompetent individuals
  - • Eczematoid dermatitis and soft tissue infection in immunosuppressed individuals
  - • Life-threatening disseminated infections in severely immunosuppressed patients.
- • Skin scrapings, culture, and biopsy used for diagnosis.
- • Surgical resection adequate for olecranon bursitis.
- • Topical treatments are ineffective; azoles can be used for early cutaneous infection. Amphotericin B is used for severe cutaneous and systemic infections with some success.

# **INTRODUCTION**

Protothecosis is a rare infection in humans caused by achlorophyllic algae belonging to the genus *Prototheca*. [1,2](#page-2-0) Infections have involved skin, subcutaneous tissue, olecranon bursa, and lymph nodes or deep organ[s3–7](#page-2-1); meningitis and algeamia are reported in severely immunocompromised individuals[.8–10](#page-2-2) More than 160[3–5](#page-2-1) cases have been reported in the world literature from temperate and tropical areas of all continents, with no clear geographic distribution[.2](#page-2-3) Veterinary infections occur in several species of animals; bovine mastitis has the most significant economic and public health importance.[11,12](#page-2-4)

#### **EPIDEMIOLOGY, NATURAL HISTORY, AND PATHOGENESIS**

The index case of protothecosis in humans occurred in a rice farmer from Sierra Leone ([Fig. 84.1\)](#page-1-0) and was caused by *Prototheca zopfii*. [13](#page-2-5) With few exceptions, most other infections in humans where the species was determined have been caused by *P. wickerhamii.*[2,5](#page-2-3) *P. zopfii* and *P. wickerhamii* are ubiquitous achloric algae usually found in soil and contaminated water. Both are unicellular organisms with hyaline walls and asexual reproduction by internal cleavage, forming endospores. *Prototheca* are thought to be mutant strains of chlorophyllic (green) algae that lack chloroplasts.[1,2](#page-2-0) Infections by both organisms have been reported in animals. *P. zopfii* causes endemic bovine mastiti[s2,11](#page-2-3); other animal pathogens, *P. stagnora,* and *P. blaschkeae,* are not known to cause disease in humans.[2](#page-2-3)

*Chlorella* spp. are similar to *Prototheca* spp. in size and staining characteristics, expect for the presence of bright green chloroplasts and periodic acid–Schiff (PAS)-positive intracytoplasmic granules[.1,2](#page-2-0) Although infections by *Chlorella* have been described in several animals, there are only two published reports involving a human.[14,15](#page-2-6)

Very little is known about the pathogenesis of protothecosis. Prior trauma often precedes localized infections in immunocompetent individuals. Immunosuppression with defects in cellmediated immunity, as well as neutrophil and natural killer cell dysfunction, probably facilitate severe and systemic infection.[4,5,9](#page-2-7) There has been an apparent rise in the number of infections in individuals with compromised immune systems. Endemic bovine mastitis is hard to treat and eradicate due to biofilm formation by the algae.[12](#page-2-8)

## **CLINICAL FEATURES AND HISTOPATHOLOGY**

Three clinical syndromes are associated with *Prototheca* infection. One is a localized infection of the olecranon bursa in patients with normal immunity, usually secondary to trauma and contact with contaminated water or soil. The second is an eczematoid dermatitis/soft tissue infection in immunosuppressed individuals,[4–6](#page-2-7) also associated with trauma and/or contact with contaminated water and soil; others are iatrogenic from contaminated catheters, peritoneal dialysis, or after orthopedic procedures. The third syndrome comprises involvement of internal organs or systemic infection in patients with severe immune suppression (AIDS, chemotherapy, and post-transplantation)[.5,7–10](#page-2-9)

Protothecosis of the olecranon bursa develops several weeks after injury to the elbow. The lesions are localized to the bursa, but there may be epithelial hyperplasia and underlying sinus tracts. The bursa is thickened, and histopathologic changes include areas of caseation necrosis surrounded by epithelioid cells, Langerhans giant cells, and fibrosis. *Prototheca* organisms are scattered throughout the areas of necrosis and in the wall of the granuloma.

Cutaneous and subcutaneous forms present as single or multiple lesions on the skin or within the subcutaneous tissue, usually over an exposed portion of the body, such as a limb or the face. The lesions are maculopapular to plaque-like and may have an overlying crust or focal ulceration; they spread slowly, often in a centrifugal pattern, and do not resolve. The inflammatory response varies from minimal to necrotizing granulomatous reaction and appears related to the depth of the invasion. The organisms may be in any or all layers of the skin and may be single or in clusters, extra-cellular or within giant cells. These lesions must be differentiated from other chronic granulomatous diseases of the skin and soft tissue.

In disseminated infections, there is a mixed infiltrate composed of acute and chronic inflammatory cells, including giant cells; organisms are usually abundant in the exudate. Some patients with protothecosis may develop a mild tissue eosinophilia.

## **PATIENT EVALUATION, DIAGNOSIS, AND DIFFERENTIAL DIAGNOSIS**

Scrapings of the skin, biopsy specimens, and aspirates can be cultured on Sabouraud's or other fungal medium and require 1 to 2 days for growth[.2](#page-2-3) Typical sporulating forms are identified on stained wet-mounts. *P. zopfii* cells ([Fig. 84.2A and B](#page-1-1)) are spherical

to ovoid, 7 to 32 µm in diameter, and rarely form morulae. *P. wickerhamii* cells are spherical, 2 to 15 µm in diameter, and frequently form morulae [\(Fig. 84.2C](#page-1-1))*.* They both stain with hematoxylin and eosin (H&E), but are better seen with Gomori methenamine silver (GMS), PAS, and the Gridley fungus (GF) stains and therefore can be easily mistaken for fungi. *Prototheca* and *Chlorella* spp. are identified in culture by the type of division, sugar assimilation tests, immunoassays, and matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization–time of flight (MALDI-TOF) and, for *Chlorella,* the presence of bright green chloroplasts[.2,15,16](#page-2-3) In tissue, the algae have similar size and staining characteristics as several fungi but can be differentiated based on cleavage, absence of budding, and/or formation of morulae.

#### **TREATMENT**

Simple surgical excision cures protothecosis of the olecranon bursa and small skin lesions. The cutaneous lesions in immunosuppressed patients resist treatment and may persist for several years, eventually spreading to other sites. Topical treatments used in the past were not effective; oral therapy with azoles is the treatment of choice in early cutaneous disease, but unresponsive, severe, and systemic infection requires intravenous amphotericin B[.17](#page-2-10)
