#### **INTRODUCTION**

Many viruses can cause hepatitis in humans, such as cytomegalovirus (CMV), or Epstein-Barr virus (EBV), but most cases are caused by at least five viruses belonging to five different families.[1,2](#page-1-0) Hepatitis A virus (HAV) and hepatitis E virus (HEV) are acquired chiefly through ingestion of fecally contaminated food or water and cause a self-limited acute illness[.3–5](#page-1-1) Hepatitis B virus (HBV), hepatitis C virus (HCV), and hepatitis D virus (HDV) are transmitted by blood, percutaneously, perinatally, and sexuall[y6–12](#page-1-2) and frequently cause acute hepatitis and persistent infection that can lead to chronic hepatitis, cirrhosis, and its complications.[13,14](#page-1-3) Epstein–Barr virus (EBV) and cytomegalovirus (CMV) also cause human hepatitis, but it is not their principal clinical characteristic[.15,16](#page-1-4)

Improved sanitation and screening blood products have significantly reduced HAV, HBV and HCV in developed countries, but these remain a serious public health problem in less developed countries, and travelers to these areas are at risk for infection[.1,17](#page-1-0) These five hepatitis viruses are a major worldwide public health challenge because of morbidity and occasional mortality during acute infections and complications of chronic HBV and HCV infections.[13,14,18](#page-1-3)

## **NATURAL HISTORY, PATHOGENESIS, AND PATHOLOGY**

Viral entry to the liver can be oral in the case of HAV and HEV, or parenterally in HBV and HCV. Common to all causes of acute viral hepatitis are focal hepatocyte necrosis and histiocytic periportal inflammation. The reticulin framework of the liver is well preserved except in cases of massive necrosis. Hepatocyte necrosis is usually multifocal with severe changes occurring in centrilobular areas. A mononuclear cellular infiltration, which is particularly marked in the portal zones, is accompanied by proliferation of the bile ducts, Kupffer's cells, and endothelial cells. Cholestasis may occur, and plugs of bile thrombi may be present in the bile canaliculi. Lesions in patients with anicteric hepatitis (i.e., without jaundice) are generally less severe, consisting of focal inflammation and necrosis. Either viral infection of hepatocytes and/or the host's immune response to the infection is the etiology of the pathologic lesions in viral hepatitis.[19,20](#page-1-5)

Repair occurs by regeneration of hepatocytes. There is a gradual disappearance of the mononuclear cell infiltrate from the portal tracts, but elongated histiocytes and fibroblasts may persist. The outcome of acute viral hepatitis may be complete resolution or fatal massive hepatic necrosis. In HBV and HCV infections the virus may persist, and chronic hepatitis, with lymphocytic inflammation and lymphoid aggregation in portal tracts occurs [\(Fig.](#page-0-0) [35.1](#page-0-0)). There may also be microvesicular fatty changes and damage to the bile ducts and acidophilic changes in the hepatocytes. Cirrhosis and hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) may develop in 15 to 35 years in those with persistent infections[.21](#page-1-6)

#### **CLINICAL FEATURES**

#### **Acute Hepatitis**

Characteristically, four clinical phases occur during a hepatitis virus infection. After exposure, the virus *incubates* during the *viral*  *replication phase* for 2 to 6 weeks for HAV and HEV and 4 to 10 weeks for HBV and HCV[.4,22](#page-1-7) Then there may be a *prodromal phase,* characterized by fever, chills, headache, fatigue, malaise, rash, arthritis, right upper quadrant pain, and a tender liver. Coincident with an improvement in systemic symptoms, the patient will have more pronounced anorexia, nausea, vomiting, weight loss, and right upper quadrant abdominal pain. During the acute icteric phase, jaundice occurs and may persist for several weeks along with dark urine, light (clay-colored) stools, and pruritus[.2,23,24](#page-1-8) Most symptoms of viral hepatitis abate within 1 to 3 weeks. Acute HCV infections are usually anicteric and are often not diagnosed. During outbreaks of HAV, and particularly HEV, there are many asymptomatic, mild, and anicteric cases. As the acute hepatitis continues into the *convalescent phase,* the patient may or may not remain icteric, but almost always has anorexia, nausea, weight loss, and, if they smoke cigarettes, lose their taste for smoking. Patients infected with HAV or HEV are more likely to have intestinal symptoms, whereas those with HBV infections may have more systemic symptomatology, such as rash, arthralgias, and arthritis.[2](#page-1-8)

### **Chronic Hepatitis**

Whereas acute infections with HAV and HEV resolve, HBV, HCV, and HDV infections may persist. In the setting of immunosuppression, chronic HEV infection is also reported. The frequency of persistence varies with the virus and the host and inversely correlates, with the severity of acute infection suggesting that cell-mediated immunity is involved in resolving the infection. HBV infection persists in less than 5% of those infected as adults, but in more than 80% of those infected as infants. Acute HCV infection is symptomatic less frequently than hepatitis B and is less likely to become chronic (ranging from 6%–85%) in children than in adults and in women than in men, those with jaundice, and those who have interleukin-28 B (IL-28B) C/C genotype (described later).

Chronic hepatitis B and C, and rarely HEV, remain asymptomatic for 15 to 35 years before complications of cirrhosis and HCC occur (see [Fig 35.1\)](#page-0-0). Bouts of mild acute hepatitis can occur

intermittently in patients with occult chronic HCV infections[.24](#page-1-9) They usually have mild flulike symptoms and mild jaundice with alanine aminotransferase (ALT) levels 100 to 200 mg/dL. These abnormalities and symptoms often clear in 2 or 3 weeks.

#### **Complications**

Usually the symptoms of acute hepatitis abate after 2 or 3 weeks, but malaise, fatigue, anorexia, and weight loss may persist for up to 6 to 8 weeks.

### Fulminating Hepatitis

Rarely, acute viral hepatitis may be fulminant, associated with altered mental status, coagulopathy, and severe jaundice, leading to death. Fulminating hepatitis occurs more frequently during acute HEV infections, particularly in pregnant women in the Indian subcontinent, but this complication is less common in other areas. It has been reported in fewer than 1 in 200 cases of HAV and is very rare in acute HCV infections but is more common in acute HBV, particularly when there is a concomitant HDV infection.

### Cirrhosis

Chronic HBV and HCV are the most common causes of liver cirrhosis. Several factors are associated with the fibrosis progression rate: duration of infection; age; male gender; alcohol consumption; HBV, HCV, and HIV co-infections; and low CD4 count. Steatosis, being overweight, and diabetes are co-factors of fibrogenesis. The viral genotype and viral load have no relationship to the development of cirrhosis.

### **PATIENT EVALUATION**

The classic finding in acute viral hepatitis is jaundice, although patients with milder infections may be anicteric when bilirubin levels remain below 2.0 to 2.5 mg/dL. There is also considerable variability of clinical manifestations in different age groups and environments. Patients with stable chronic hepatitis usually do not have jaundice. In both conditions, the patient has other symptoms and signs listed in other sections. The classic laboratory abnormalities of acute hepatitis are elevated serum ALT and aspartate aminotransferase (AST) up to 10 to 20 times normal and serum bilirubin up to 10 to 15 times normal. There may be elevations in alkaline phosphatase, and atypical lymphocytes can be noted in the peripheral blood film in the presence of a normal leukocyte count. Bilirubin is often also present in the urine. These laboratory abnormalities can help detect mild and asymptomatic cases[.20](#page-1-10)

Diagnosis of anicteric cases of hepatitis are often based upon a history of potential exposures to patients with hepatitis or risk factors of infection. The severity of acute and chronic hepatitis is best measured by the clinical symptoms and serum levels of bilirubin, ALT, or AST. Additional tests that can be done in chronic hepatitis include liver biopsy, ultrasonography, and non-invasive tests to evaluate the degree of hepatic fibrosis.

Each virus elicits a characteristic antibody response. Detection of virus-specific immunoglobulin (Ig)M class immunoglobulins generally represents acute infection, whereas IgG antibodies may be present years after resolution of disease. Detection of viral antigens or nucleic acid represents chronic infection and correlates with transmissibility.

#### **TREATMENT AND PREVENTION**

There is no specific treatment for acute HAV and HEV hepatitis. Supportive care, including rest, is important[.23,25](#page-1-11) Silymarin, a milk thistle extract, was reported to slightly accelerate recovery of some symptoms of acute clinical hepatitis; however, the most effective dose schedule has not been ascertained.[26](#page--1-0) Secondary transmission should be prevented through active and passive immunization and careful sanitation and behavior modification. (See subchapters on HBV, HCV, and HDV on treatment of acute and chronic infection with these viruses.)

Highly effective vaccines are available for preventing HAV and HBV infections. Two HEV vaccines were approved and found to be 95% effective, but they are not commercially available due to inadequate demand[.27,28](#page--1-1) HDV infections, requiring HBV replication, can be prevented by immunization for HBV.
