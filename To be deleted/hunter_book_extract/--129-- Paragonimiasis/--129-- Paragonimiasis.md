# **129** Paragonimiasis

*Udomsak Silachamroon, Yupaporn Wattanagoon*

## KEY FEATURES

- • Paragonimiasis is caused by lung flukes of the genus *Paragonimus.*
- • *P. westermani* is the most common species of the more than 10 that can infect humans.
- • Disease is prevalent in Asia, Africa, and Central and South America.
- • Humans acquire infection by eating raw or undercooked freshwater crabs or crayfish containing the metacercaria intermediate form.
- • After ingestion, metacercaria penetrate the intestinal wall and migrate to the lung, where they develop into adult flukes; this corresponds to the acute stage.
- • In chronic infection, adult worms reside in a pulmonary worm cyst and produce eggs that are coughed into the environment or passed in feces; symptoms are chronic cough with gelatinous, tenacious, and rusty-brown sputum; hemoptysis; and shortness of breath.
- • Where paragonimiasis and tuberculosis are both endemic, they must be differentiated from each other, especially when a patient presents with hemoptysis.
- • Diagnosis is made by documenting eggs in sputum, stool, or pleural fluid; serology can also play a role.
- • Treatment is usually successful with praziquantel.

#### **INTRODUCTION**

Paragonimiasis is caused by lung flukes of the genus *Paragonimus.* More than 10 species of *Paragonimus* are infective to humans; the most commonly reported is *P. westermani.* The disease is acquired through eating raw or undercooked freshwater crabs or crayfish containing the infective metacercaria stage of the fluke.

#### **EPIDEMIOLOGY**

More than 22 million people are infected globally[1](#page-3-0) with about 200 million at risk. Paragonimiasis is prevalent in Asia—especially Southeast Asia—Africa, and Central and South America. *P. westermani,* the oriental lung fluke infection, is common in China, the Philippines, and Vietnam, whereas *P. heterotremus* causes infection in Thailand. *P. mexicanus* causes infection in Central and South America, and *P. africanus* and *P. uterobilateralis* are the major causes of infection in Africa. Human infection with *P. kellicotti* has been reported in the United States.

#### **NATURAL HISTORY, PATHOLOGY, AND PATHOGENESIS**

The variation in pathologic findings reflects the number of infecting worms, duration of infection, and tissues affected. Toxic and allergic factors can be involved.

Infection is acquired through ingestion of metacercariae in undercooked or raw crab or crayfish [\(Fig. 129.1](#page-1-0)). The metacercariae excyst, penetrate the intestinal wall, enter the abdominal cavity, and then cross the diaphragm into the lung, where they mature into adult worms over a period of about 2 months. Adult worms produce eggs that gain access to the tracheobronchial tree through fistulas from the parasitic lung cyst. Eggs are coughed up and shed into the environment through sputum or after swallowing and passage in the feces. Once in freshwater, the eggs hatch, releasing miracidia that infect snail hosts, where parasite amplification and development occur. Cercariae are released from the snail and infect crustacean hosts that are then ingested by humans. In some cases, infection can follow consumption of a paratenic host such as wild boars[.2,3](#page-3-1)

## **Pulmonary Lesions**

Migration of larval flukes in the lungs (and frequently in other tissues) induces local necrosis, hemorrhage, and inflammatory exudate, which is followed by fibrous encapsulation of the fluke in a worm cyst. In the lungs, initial lesions are usually located a few centimeters beneath the pleural surface, near bronchioles or bronchi. Pathology includes bronchopneumonia, interstitial pneumonia, bronchitis, bronchiectasis, atelectasis, fibrosis, pleural thickening, pleural effusion, angiitis obliterans, and periphlebitis.

Macroscopically, the worm cysts are 1- to 4-cm, distended, grayish-white nodules. In cross-section they have irregular outlines and cavities, within which are one to two worms and, uncommonly, three or more. The total number of cysts in the lungs is usually fewer than 20, with the larger proportion located in the right lung.

Microscopically, the cyst wall consists of granulation tissue with fibroblasts, lymphoid cells, mononuclear cells, plasma cells, and eosinophils. Within the cavity are numerous Charcot–Leyden crystals, *Paragonimus* eggs, and necrotic material. In the vicinity of the cysts are tunnels, burrows, egg tubercles, and calcified eggs.

#### **Ectopic Lesions**

Young, or even mature, flukes can migrate from the lungs and reach almost any organ, including the breast, psoas muscle, testes, scrotum, spermatic cord, liver, gut wall, other abdominal viscera, uterine and vaginal wall, spinal cord, and brain. In the ectopic site, the flukes reach sexual maturity. Cysts, granulomas, or abscesses can then form around the flukes or their eggs. Some immature flukes migrate from the lungs through the jugular or carotid foramen at the base of the skull to reach the temporal and occipital lobes of the brain, where they produce necrosis and eosinophilic granulomatous reactions. In China, migratory subcutaneous swellings are common with *P. skrjabini* infection, and ova have been found at the centers of small eosinophilic granulomas in the pericardium, meninges, and liver.

#### **CLINICAL MANIFESTATIONS**

In light infections, the majority of patients are asymptomatic. Even in heavy infections, most patients have few symptoms and appear well, despite severe pathology. The disease can be classified into an acute stage and chronic stages involving pulmonary or extrapulmonary sites.

#### **Acute Stage**

This stage corresponds to the period of invasion and migration of the young flukes. Although this stage often passes undiagnosed,

<span id="page-1-0"></span>**Fig. 129.1** Eggs are excreted in the sputum or are swallowed and passed in the stool (1). In the environment, the eggs mature and release miracidia (2, 3) that seek the first intermediate snail host (4). Miracidia develop in the snail, giving rise to many cercariae (4). Cercariae invade the second intermediate host, a crustacean such as crab or crayfish, encyst, and become metacercariae; they are now infective for humans (5). Humans eat the inadequately cooked crustacean (6). Metacercariae excyst in the duodenum (7), penetrate the intestinal wall, migrate through the diaphragm into the lungs, become encapsulated, and develop into adult flukes (8). The time from infection to laying eggs is 65 to 90 days. (Courtesy, Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, Atlanta, GA.)

clinical signs and symptoms include diarrhea, abdominal pain, urticaria, and eosinophilia, followed by fever, chest pain, cough, dyspnea, malaise, and night sweats. The symptoms usually spontaneously resolve after 1 to 2 months.

#### **Chronic Stage**

#### Pulmonary Paragonimiasis

The incubation period is about 6 months (range, 1–27 months). Cough, sputum, and chest discomfort increase gradually and are similar to those in chronic bronchitis. The cough is spasmodic, usually occurs on walking or after exertion, and is productive. Sputum is characteristically gelatinous, tenacious, and rusty-brown. Hemoptysis is common and can be aggravated by strenuous exertion. Pleuritic chest pain is also common. About half of the patients complain of breathlessness on exertion, and some complain of wheezing. Mild fever may be present.

Physical signs are not distinct; digital clubbing can occur. Secondary bronchopneumonia and lung abscess are complications. Pleural involvement includes unilateral or bilateral pleural effusion or, in rare instances, pseudochylothorax. Co-infection of pulmonary paragonimiasis and tuberculosis is not uncommon.

#### Extrapulmonary Paragonimiasis

**Cerebral and Spinal Paragonimiasis.** In endemic areas of Asia, 25% of hospitalized cases are due to brain invasion. Eighty percent of these patients are under 10 years old, and most are males. Cerebral disease is particularly prevalent in rural South Korea, where it is the most common cause of cerebral tumor. As many as 10 round or oval cysts, measuring a few millimeters to 10 cm in diameter, are found in the temporal and occipital lobes, near the jugular foramen.

In the acute phase, manifestations can resemble meningoencephalitis. Patients suffer headache, vomiting, fever, and visual disturbances. With progression, patients can have papilledema, bitemporal hemianopsia, facial palsy, hemiplegia, paraplegia, Jacksonian seizures, and coma. Death during the acute phase is not uncommon. In non-fatal cases, spontaneous remission occurs

<span id="page-2-1"></span>in 1 to 2 months, but recurrence may follow. Pleocytosis of the cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) with a high eosinophil count is usually seen. Cysts can be demonstrated by computed tomography or angiography.

Rarely, spinal cord involvement presents as paraplegia or monoplegia, with weakness of the extremities and disturbance in sensation.

**Abdominal Paragonimiasis.** Findings include abdominal pain and tenderness; bloody diarrhea; nausea; vomiting; palpable nodules; and abscess formation in the liver, spleen, or abdominal cavity. These may simulate a bacterial infection. In some instances, cysts rupture into the intestinal lumen and release *Paragonimus* eggs that can be recovered in the feces.

**Migratory Subcutaneous Paragonimiasis.** Migratory subcutaneous nodules occur in 20% to 60% of patients with *P. skrjabini* and 10% of those with *P. westermani* infections. They are firm, tender, slightly mobile, a few millimeters to 10 cm in diameter, and are often irritating. The most common sites are the lower abdomen, inguinal region, and thigh.

In China, *P. skrjabini* is unable to develop to maturity in the lungs. Instead of findings of hemoptysis and ova in the sputum, the striking feature is trematode larva migrans associated with migratory subcutaneous nodules accompanied by marked eosinophilic leukocytosis and necrotic liver lesions. In many cases, the nodules contain juvenile flukes. Brain involvement with subarachnoid hemorrhage has been reported.

#### **PATIENT EVALUATION, DIAGNOSIS, AND DIFFERENTIAL DIAGNOSIS**

A presumptive diagnosis can be made in a patient who has a history of chronic bronchitis, blood-streaked sputum, and occasional hemoptysis and who lives in an endemic area and has eaten raw crustaceans.

Laboratory tests show an eosinophilic leukocytosis. Chest radiographs in the early stage show ill-defined opacities. Later radiographic findings include cavitary lesions, lung infiltration (nodular, patchy, or linear type), calcified foci, pleural thickening, pleural effusions ([Figs. 129.2](#page-2-1) and [129.3](#page-2-0)), and hilar enlargement[.4](#page-3-2)

<span id="page-2-0"></span>Pleural fluid can be serous, serosanguinous, or chylous[.5](#page-3-3) It is characteristically an exudate with high protein (6–7g/dL), very low glucose (<10 mg/dL), high lactate dehydrogenase (>1000 U/L), elevated percentage of eosinophils (12%–75%), and low pH (<7.10)[.6](#page-3-4)

Confirmation is by finding characteristic eggs [\(Fig. 129.4\)](#page-3-5) in sputum, stool, pleural effusion, or CSF, or identifying adult flukes in subcutaneous nodules, in surgical specimens, or rarely in sputum. A wet smear is the standard technique for identifying eggs. Eggs can also easily be detected by Ziehl–Neelsen staining.[7](#page-3-6)

Serology is used for detection of antibody to *Paragonimus* spp. via enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) and immunoblot;

<span id="page-3-5"></span>both are sensitive and specific[.8](#page-3-7) Antigen detection using monoclonal antibody is useful in active infection.[9](#page-3-8) Immunodiagnosis is particularly helpful for diagnosing extrapulmonary disease when *Paragonimus* ova cannot be detected in sputum or stool samples. Most treated patients become seronegative after about 6 to 12 months.

The differential diagnosis of pulmonary paragonimiasis includes pulmonary tuberculosis, lung abscess, chronic bronchitis or bronchiectasis, and primary and metastatic pulmonary carcinoma. Patients with chronic cough or hemoptysis and acid-fast bacillinegative sputum who live in *Paragonimus*-endemic areas should be investigated for paragonimiasis, as its prevalence can be as high as 50% and patients can be cured with anti-helminthic drugs within a few days. Cerebral and spinal paragonimiasis must be differentiated from abscess, tuberculoma, and other helminthic infections, including fascioliasis, schistosomiasis, cysticercosis, hydatid disease, angiostrongyliasis, and gnathostomiasis.

Subcutaneous paragonimiasis can be confused with gnathostomiasis, sparganosis, onchocerciasis, cysticercosis, and ectopic fascioliasis.

#### **TREATMENT**

The drug of choice is praziquantel 25 mg/kg three times per day after meals for 3 days. The cure rate is almost 100[%10–12](#page-3-9); only a few patients with heavy infections require a second course of treatment. A second course should be considered in cases with relapsed respiratory symptoms or pleural effusion. The duration for the second course can range from 3 to 7 days.[13](#page-3-10) Symptoms improve rapidly and disappear within a few months. Eggs clear from the sputum in a few weeks, whereas the radiologic pulmonary lesions can take months to clear.

The dosage for cerebral paragonimiasis is often higher and must be adjusted according to the clinical response. However, reports from China showed that most cases of cerebral paragonimiasis can be treated with praziquantel in the standard dose for 3 days. Surgical resections of the lesions were needed in some cases.[14,15](#page-3-11) Because convulsions and coma during therapy can occur, treatment should be done in hospital with corticosteroids to prevent brain edema.

A randomized, controlled trial in small numbers of patients showed that oral triclabendazole 5 mg/kg/day for 3 days or 10 mg/ kg bid for 1 day gives the same cure rate as praziquantel but has a faster egg reduction rate.[16](#page-3-12) The drug is not as available as praziquantel. Bithionol in a dose of 30 to 50 mg/kg/day on alternative days for 10 to 15 days is also effective, although the drug has treatment-limiting side effects[.17](#page-3-13) Anaphylactic reactions to praziquantel have been reported in a few cases. If necessary, successful treatment with praziquantel has been achieved after oral desensitization[.18](#page-3-14) Surgical resection of ectopic paragonimiasis in subcutaneous nodules has cured extrapulmonary paragonimiasis.

Pulmonary paragonimiasis is rarely fatal; even without treatment, flukes die or disappear within 10 to 20 years. Pleural effusion can be protracted and recur after treatment. Most cases of cerebral disease are associated with chronic morbidity as a result of epilepsy and other neurologic sequelae. Five percent of the patients die as a result of hemorrhage—usually in the first 2 years of the disease.

#### **PREVENTION AND CONTROL**

Health education, especially for young schoolchildren, is needed to change the dietary customs of eating raw or undercooked crab or crayfish. Mass treatment with bithionol in some endemic areas in Korea proved effective in reducing the prevalence of paragonimiasis. Mollusciciding is impractical.
