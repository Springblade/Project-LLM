# **INTRODUCTION**

Human African trypanosomiasis (HAT) is an important neglected tropical disease. Although case numbers have been dramatically reduced in the last 10 years after multilateral, intense, and coordinated control efforts, HAT remains a smoldering threat to 65 million people in sub-Saharan Africa.

The description of sleeping sickness preceded the discovery of its cause by centuries. John Atkin described "a sleepy distemper" reminiscent of second-stage trypanosomiasis off the coast of Guinea in 1721, and Winterbottom published an account of lethargy in Sierra Leone that was sometimes associated with "small glandular tumors in the neck." However, it was only after Pasteur's demonstration that microorganisms can cause disease that trypanosomes began to be identified in the blood of animals.

David Livingstone had already written (1858) of a *nagana,* a disease of horses ("which follows the bite of the tsetse") when Bruce identified trypanosomes in large mammals in Ubombo, Zululand. The first human infection was described by Forde and Dutton in a sailor returning from The Gambia; the trypanosomes were classified as a new species, *Trypanosoma gambiense,* in 1902. Castellani first reported trypanosomes in the cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) of patients in 1903. In 1910, Stephens and Fentham described a morphologically different parasite—"with a nucleus at the posterior (non-flagellar) end"—and named it *T. rhodesiense,* as the patient had returned from a prospecting expedition in northeastern Rhodesia. This parasite was more virulent in laboratory models than *T. gambiense.* A year later, Kinghorn and Yorke showed that *Glossina morsitans* can transmit *T. rhodesiense* to monkeys.

Although arsenic had been used to treat a mare with *nagana* and Forde used Fowler's solution to treat his patient from The Gambia, Friedham carried out the first drug trials of arsenic derivatives in the 1940s, selecting melarsoprol, which was licensed in 1949.

The control of trypanosomiasis in endemic areas crucially depends on public health measures that were developed during the major epidemics in the last century. Eugene Jamot evolved the concept of a mobile team for case finding, which has proved to be so important for control in recent years.

Scientific studies of trypanosomes have resulted in the discovery of antigenic variation, glycosylphosphatidylinositol (GPI) anchors, polycistronic transcription, RNA splicing, mitochondrial RNA editing, and several unusual metabolic pathways but, as yet, precious few new agents for treatment[.1](#page-6-0)

HAT is caused by two morphologically indistinguishable protozoal parasites: *T. b. rhodesiense,* which is responsible for a more acute form of the disease, and *T. b. gambiense,* which causes a more chronic infection. Both invariably progress to a fatal outcome unless treated (see [Table 102.1](#page-1-0) for forms of HAT). A third subspecies, *T. b. brucei,* is almost exclusively an animal subspecies that causes economically important disease in ungulates. In Malawi, a more chronic version of *T. b. rhodesiense* has been described, possibly with a distinct immunopathogenetic mechanism.

# **EPIDEMIOLOGY**

Within the subkingdom Protozoa and order Kinetoplastida, the genus *Trypanosoma* belongs to the family Trypanosomatidae and subgenus *Trypanozoon.* The three species in this subgenus, *T. brucei, T. evansi,* and *T. equiperdum,* are morphologically indistinguishable. *T. brucei* is transmitted by tsetse flies and develops in their midgut and salivary glands. It is divided into three subspecies: the two human pathogens *T. b. gambiense* and *T. b. rhodesiense* and the animal pathogen *T. b. brucei.* It is their epidemiology, molecular biology, and behavior in the vertebrate host that establish the strongest distinctions between subspecies.

In nature, *T. b. brucei* can infect all domestic animals, camels, some antelopes, and carnivores; *T. b. rhodesiense* infects humans, domestic livestock, and some wild antelopes, and *T. b. gambiense* infects humans, pigs, and sheep and only occasionally other orders.

Trypanosomes are flagellated, extracellular protozoa ([Fig. 102.1](#page-1-1)) that are long and slender (12–42 µm) and multiply in the bloodstream. They have a single, tubular mitochondrion located near the flagellum, which contains circular DNAs within concatenated structures called the *kinetoplast*. Some develop in "short stumpy" forms, which are taken up by tsetse flies when they feed, and in the midgut they develop into procyclic forms and multiply by binary fission. After about 2 weeks in the gut, trypanosomes migrate to the salivary glands as epimastigotes, where they develop into metacyclic forms that can infect the next host. There are many coordinated changes in the metabolism and antigenicity of the parasite as its morphologic program progresses in each host. In contrast to *Leishmania* spp. and *T. cruzi,* there is no evidence for intracellular stages of *T. brucei.*

#### **Vector**

African trypanosomes are transmitted by different species of the tsetse fly (*Glossina* spp.) found in microfoci between the latitudes 14°N and 29°S ([Fig. 102.2\)](#page-2-0).[2](#page-6-1) The genus of these biologically unique insects comprises 31 distinct species and subspecies. Only few are relevant vectors of HAT, the most important being *G. morsitans* ([Fig. 102.3\)](#page-2-1), *G. fuscipes,* and *G. palpalis.* Their distinctive behavior, ecology (warm temperatures), and chosen habitat (shade and humidity for resting and larviposition) explain many epidemiologic features of sleeping sickness. Tsetse flies can live for many months in the wild, but give birth to only about eight larvae per lifetime. Both sexes feed on blood, inflicting a painful bite. A relatively small proportion of flies in the field (<1%) are competent to transmit infection, with a higher proportion being found in epidemics (<5%).

# <span id="page-1-1"></span>**NATURAL HISTORY, PATHOGENESIS, AND PATHOLOGY**

Normal human plasma has a trypanolytic factor that does not allow animal trypanosomes (including *T. b. brucei* and *T. evansi*) to survive. This protective factor, serum resistance antigen, is made of apolipoprotein L1, apolipoprotein A-I, and haptoglobin-related protein, which together are found in the densest subfraction of high-density lipoprotein (HDL3) and in another lipid-poor complex of IgMs. This mechanism has helped to explain how a human case of *T. evansi* developed, as the patient was deficient in apolipoprotein L1. Normal human serum or recombinant apoLI inserts anionic pores in the lysosomal membrane of parasites, causing lysis through osmotic swelling[.3](#page-6-2) The pathogenic subspecies of *T. brucei* have developed a genetic resistance against the human trypanolytic factor.

Apart from serum resistance gene, which acts to protect against innate host defense, parasites have also evolved a dense surface coat of glycoprotein (variant surface glycoprotein or VSG), which is shed when the host's immune system develops anti-VSG IgM and IgG antibody responses. Approximately 107 molecules of a single VSG variant are expressed at any one time, being replaced with an antigenically distinct version in a smaller, proliferating subset of parasites (about 2%) that multiply to replace the ones that have already been recognized by the host immune response. While trying to catch up by generating new VSG antibodies, the parasites constantly produce different surface coats. New VSGs are generated through programmed DNA rearrangements from a non-expressed context to an expression-linked, telomerically located region. Although this elaborate antigenic switching mechanism is well understood in molecular terms, it has not yielded a solution to the problem it creates for making a vaccine against this organism.

# **Polyclonal Activation of B Cells**

A further consequence of antigenic variation is chronic stimulation of the host's immune system with hypergammaglobulinemia, penetration of trypanosomes into privileged sites such as the central nervous system (CNS), and stimulation of the cytokine and mediator networks, exhausting defense mechanisms. Much of the IgM and IgG antibody is directed to non-VSG antigens, with production of rheumatoid factor–like reactivity, anti-DNA antibodies, and heterophile antibodies, some of which can be confusing if identified in screening tests. Cross-reactivity with numerous other serologic tests is common and can be misleading.

# **CLINICAL FEATURES**

There is no unique clinical picture of HAT, and the disease in all its stages offers a sometimes wide range of differential diagnoses. The infection often has an insidious onset, but HAT, whether its East or West African subspecies, will nearly invariably kill if the patient is not treated in time[.4](#page-6-3) Determination of clinical staging by laboratory investigations is important for the clinical management of the patient.

#### **The Trypanosomal Chancre**

Tsetse bites can be quite painful. In the case of an infection, a local reaction called *trypanosomal chancre* ([Fig. 102.4\)](#page-3-0) can develop at the site where the fly has injected parasites with its saliva. A small raised papule develops after about 5 days. It increases rapidly in size, surrounded by an intense erythematous tissue reaction with local edema and regional lymphadenopathy. Although some chancres have an "angry" appearance, they are usually not very painful unless they become ulcerated and superinfected. They heal without treatment after several weeks, leaving a permanent, hyperpigmented spot. Trypanosomal chancres occur in more than half of the cases of *T. b. rhodesiense.* In *T. b. gambiense,* they are much less common and often go undetected in endemic populations. Inexperienced clinicians might misdiagnose chancres as cutaneous manifestations of bacterial diseases, such as superinfected insect bites, eschars, or cutaneous anthrax.

#### **Hemolymphatic Stage (HAT Stage I)**

The hemolymphatic stage of *T. b. rhodesiense* infection can present dramatically with fever and clinical features that often resemble severe falciparum malaria or septicemia. Patients may die within the first weeks after the onset of symptoms, commonly through cardiac involvement (myocarditis). In the early stage of *T. b. gambiense* infection, symptoms are usually infrequent and mild. Laboratory findings indicate raised levels of markers of inflammation (C-reactive protein [CRP], erythrocyte sedimentation rate [ESR]), normal to low white blood cell (WBC) counts, anemia, and often a marked thrombocytopenia, depending on the severity of the clinical condition[.5](#page-6-4)

After the initial phase, febrile episodes become less severe as the disease progresses. Fever is often undulating, reflecting lysis

A reliable sign, particularly in *T. b. gambiense* infection, is the enlargement of lymph nodes in the posterior triangle of the neck (Winterbottom's sign, [Fig. 102.5](#page-3-1)). Other typical signs might be a fleeting patchy or circinate rash, a myxedematous infiltration of connective tissue ("puffy face syndrome," [Fig. 102.6\)](#page-3-2), and an inconspicuous periostitis of the tibia with delayed hyperesthesia (Kérandel's sign).

#### **Meningoencephalitic Stage (HAT Stage II)**

Within weeks in *T. b. rhodesiense* and months or even years in *T. b. gambiense* infection, cerebral involvement will invariably follow the early stages of HAT. Trypanosomes cross the blood–brain barrier and enter the CSF by mechanisms that are still not clearly understood.

The onset of stage II is insidious and may not be identified reliably clinically. As the disease progresses, patients complain of increasing headache, and some may detect a marked change in behavior and personality. Neurologic symptoms, which follow gradually, can be focal or generalized, depending on the site of cellular damage in the CNS. Radiologic changes include bilateral, hyperintense signals at magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) T2-signal prolongation, predominantly involving the periventricular and frontal white matter, as well as affecting the internal capsule, basal ganglia, and cerebellum. The histologic correlate is a perivascular infiltration of inflammatory cells ("cuffing") and glial proliferation, resembling cerebral endarteritis. Neuronal elements may be less affected.[6](#page-6-5)

Convulsions in late-stage trypanosomiasis are common, usually indicating a poor prognosis. Periods of confusion and agitation

Other evidence of CNS involvement includes the inability to execute relatively simple tasks ([Fig. 102.8\)](#page-4-0). Inflammatory reactions in the hypothalamic structures lead to a dysfunction in circadian rhythms and sleep regulatory systems. Sleep patterns become fragmented and finally result in a somnolent and comatose state. Progressive wasting and dehydration follow the inability to eat and drink. In some cases, morular cells of Mott, activated plasma cells with eosinophilic inclusions containing IgM antibodies, can be seen in the CSF [\(Fig. 102.9\)](#page-4-1).

# **PATIENT EVALUATION, DIAGNOSIS, AND DIFFERENTIAL DIAGNOSIS**

Few infections demand a confirmed diagnosis as much as African trypanosomiasis, because patient management is complicated and the treatments available can be fatally toxic. Clinical suspicion is triggered when a patient lives in or returns from an area endemic for trypanosomiasis (see [Fig. 102.2](#page-2-0)). The first step is a distinction between the two forms: For *T. b. rhodesiense* infections, the appearance of a chancre and the presence of high fever should raise suspicion and trigger a vigorous search for parasites in the blood film or the

<span id="page-4-1"></span>chancre aspirate. *T. b. gambiense* infections can present sometimes months or years after exposure with symptoms that may be relatively non-specific, sometimes even mimicking psychoses. Again, detection of parasites is critical to management, and these can be sought in blood, lymph node aspirates, or the CSF. In endemic areas, active case finding relies on serologic screening tests for *T. b. gambiense* that identify individuals at high risk of being infected.[7](#page-6-6) When serologic tests show up strongly positive and there are appropriate clinical findings, and especially when there is evidence of advanced (stage II) disease, treatment can be given empirically. For infection with *T. b. rhodesiense,* serologic tests are unhelpful, but parasites are much easier to detect because they are commonly present in greater abundance in the bloodstream.

*T. b. gambiense* can cause disease even though it may be present in numbers well below the limits for detection (<10 parasites/mL) by any method that examines body fluids. Repeated examinations for parasites, or, if possible, subinoculation into a susceptible animal species, may help in detection.

# **Aspiration of Chancre or Lymph Node**

Chancres mark the portal of entry of trypanosomes and are more common in *T. b. rhodesiense,* where half of the patients may manifest this sign, whereas they are less common in *T. b. gambiense* infections, particularly in patients in endemic areas. If present, they are a good source of parasites. Fluid from enlarged lymph nodes, frequently posterior cervical nodes that form Winterbottom's sign, can be aspirated and visualized immediately (×400) with direct microscopy or, if available, dark-field illumination. Fresh preparations contain motile trypanosomes that catch the eye by jostling their neighboring cells.

#### **Blood Films**

Thick blood films, stained with Field or Giemsa stains identical to the ones used for malaria diagnosis, can show trypanosomes, although concentration techniques might be required to identify parasites in *T. b. gambiense* infection. Morphology may be poor in thick films, but the longer time required to examine thin films that preserve morphology may outweigh their value in screening for this infection. In contrast, blood film examinations are much more useful in *T. b. rhodesiense* infections.

# **Concentration Methods**

Many approaches to concentrate parasites before visualization have been successfully developed. Probably the most robust one relies on a mini anion exchange column that allows trypanosomes through its cellulose matrix when 300 µL of blood is added to it (compared with ≈10 µL of blood volume examined on a thick film). The kit is not commercially available and is used only by specialized laboratories. Another method has been adapted from malaria diagnosis, the quantitative buffy coat (QBC) method. A similar approach uses capillary tube centrifugation (CTC). These approaches can be combined with better visualization techniques such as fluorescence labeling to improve parasite recognition and field-adapted. Relatively cheap fluorescence microscopes with light-emitting diodes as source illumination, which have been developed by the Foundation for Innovative New Diagnostics (FIND). The sensitivity of detection may not be especially high, but these microscopes can also be used to diagnose other infections and can be solar powered.

#### **Nucleic Acid Amplification Techniques**

Genus-, species-, and subspecies-specific primers are well described and available for use in epidemiologic studies of African trypanosomiasis, but conventional polymerase chain reaction (PCR) currently lacks sensitivity to detect parasites in low abundance. Newer approaches, including the use of isothermal PCR techniques (loop mediated isothermal amplification, or LAMP), that demand much less in the way of equipment are being investigated by FIND and can be applied to dried blood spots.

#### **Serologic Assays**

Various serologic tests exist for the diagnosis of *T. b. gambiense* infection, whereas serology is not reliable for the detection of *T.b. rhodesiense.* For active screening programs a card agglutination test for trypanosomiasis (CATT) has been used for many years to screen for antibodies against *T. b. gambiense* using a mixture of abundant parasite antigens. This is a rapid, field-adapted test that detects antibodies by their ability to agglutinate antigen but does not confirm the infection. Rather, a positive result should stimulate the search for parasites. The CATT can be obtained from the Department of Parasitology, Prince Leopold Institute of Tropical Medicine, Antwerp, Belgium ([www.itg.be\)](http://www.itg.be/).

#### **New Developments**

Recently novel rapid diagnostic tests have been introduced: the HAT Sero-K-SeT and the SD Bioline HAT 1.0. These tests have been improved and are now >90% sensitive in detecting HAT, although specificity is less rigorous. They are cheap, stable in storage, easy to use, and a valuable additional asset in passive screening and the integration of HAT diagnosis in peripheral health facilities.

#### **TREATMENT**

Treatment of HAT is difficult and dangerous for the patient in all stages. Hospitalization is usually necessary. Patient management requires not only the availability and correct administration of drugs that have numerous side effects but also a high standard of general medical skills and nursing care to deal with treatment reactions and concomitant pathologies, as most patients with late-stage trypanosomiasis are severely ill and malnourished. Compounding this, sleeping sickness is a disease of rural, remote places where health care systems tend to be rudimentary. Many health facilities in areas where HAT occurs work under emergency conditions with extremely restricted resources. However, if managed properly, HAT can be cured, especially when the diagnosis is made at an early stage of the disease. Several properly conducted and sufficiently powered clinical trials are available to evaluate duration, dosage, possible combinations of drugs, and co-administration of ancillary treatments.

#### **Management of HAT Stage I**

The treatment of HAT depends on the trypanosome subspecies and the stage of the disease ([Tables 102.2](#page-5-0) and [102.3\)](#page-5-1).

# Pentamidine

Pentamidine has become the drug of choice for *gambiense* HAT stage I, achieving cure rates as high as 98%. But in *T. rhodesiense* HAT there are frequent failures. Lower rates of cellular pentamidine uptake in *T. b. rhodesiense* may explain these differences. Some cures of stage II infections have also been reported, but CSF drug levels are usually not sufficiently high to guarantee a reliable trypanosomicidal effect in the CNS.

Pentamidine is usually given by deep intramuscular injection on 7 consecutive days, which sometimes can be managed on an outpatient basis. If hospital care and reasonable monitoring conditions are available, an intravenous infusion, given in normal saline over 2 hours, could be used instead. The main advantage of pentamidine over other drugs is the short treatment course and ease of administration. Glucose should be given to avoid hypoglycemia and patients put to rest after the administration to prevent the risk of hypotension. Other adverse effects are related to the route of administration (pain, abscesses) or dose and are usually reversible.

After an intervention led by the World Health Organization (WHO), a limited amount of pentamidine is now made available for use in HAT through a public–private partnership.

#### Suramin

In the early twentieth century, the development of the complex sulfated naphthylamine suramin ("Bayer 205"), resulting from German research on the trypanosomicidal activity of various dyes and heavy metals, was a major breakthrough in the field of tropical medicine. For the first time, African trypanosomiasis, at least in its early stages, became treatable.

Suramin is still the drug of choice to treat stage I HAT caused by *T. b. rhodesiense.* Like pentamidine, it does not reach therapeutic levels in CSF. Suramin is injected intravenously immediately after dilution in distilled water.

Adverse effects, especially pyrexia and nephrotoxicity, depend on nutritional status, concomitant illnesses (especially onchocerciasis), and the patient's clinical condition. Although life-threatening reactions like anaphylactic shock have been described, serious adverse effects are rare.

#### **Management of HAT Stage II**

#### Melarsoprol

Until the introduction of the arsenical compound melarsoprol, late-stage trypanosomiasis was virtually untreatable. Since then, melarsoprol has remained the most widely used stage II antitrypanosomal drug for both *T. b. gambiense* and *rhodesiense* infections and has thus saved many lives. However, melarsoprol carries a high rate of serious adverse effects.[8](#page-6-7) In addition, there is increasing evidence for relapses after treatment and resistance in some parts of Angola, Congo, Sudan, and Uganda.

Melarsoprol clears trypanosomes rapidly from the blood, lymph, and CSF. It is given by slow intravenous injection; extravascular leakage must be avoided because of the risk of tissue necrosis. The most important adverse effect is an acute encephalopathy, usually appearing around day 5 to 8 of the treatment course in 5% to 14% of all patients. Severe headache, convulsions, rapid neurologic deterioration, or deepening of coma are the indicators of a reaction, which is immune-mediated by release of parasite antigens in the first days of treatment. MRI changes associated with this reaction are of a diffuse hemorrhagic encephalopathy and cerebral edema. The overall case fatality under treatment ranges between 2% and 12%, depending on the stage of disease and the quality of medical and nursing care. Simultaneous administration of glucocorticosteroids (prednisolone 1 mg/kg body weight; maximum 40 mg daily) might reduce mortality, especially in cases with high CSF pleocytosis.[9](#page-6-8)

#### Eflornithine (DFMO)

Initially developed as an anti-tumor agent, eflornithine (alphadifluoro-methylornithine) was introduced in 1980 as an antitrypanosomal drug. Cost and limited availability have restricted its use mostly to melarsoprol-refractory cases of *T. b. gambiense*

sleeping sickness. *T. b. rhodesiense* is much less sensitive due to a much higher turnover rate of the target enzyme ornithine decarboxylase and therefore cannot be treated with eflornithine.

Eflornithine can be taken orally, but intravenous administration is preferred, as it achieves a much higher bioavailability and success rate. The infusion should be administered slowly over a period of at least 30 minutes. Continuous 24-hour administration is preferable if facilities allow.

The range of adverse reactions to eflornithine is wide; their occurrence and intensity increase with the duration of treatment and the severity of the patient's general condition.

In 2001 agreements were signed between the WHO and two drug-producing companies (Bayer HealthCare and Sanofi-Aventis), which led to a "public–private partnership" (PPP) and helped to assure a sufficient supply of eflornithine and other drugs essential for the treatment of HAT. The agreement has been extended, and there are promising signs for its continuation.

#### Nifurtimox

Ten years after its introduction for the treatment of American trypanosomiasis in 1967, nifurtimox was found to be effective in the treatment of *T. b. gambiense* sleeping sickness. It has a place as a second-line treatment in melarsoprol-refractory cases and especially as a partner in combination therapies. Nifurtimox is often not well tolerated, with gastrointestinal (nausea, epigastric pain) and neurologic (polyneuropathies, ataxia) symptoms being the most pronounced, but adverse effects are usually not severe. They are dose related and rapidly reversible after discontinuation of the drug.

#### Combination Treatments in HAT

Melarsoprol, eflornithine, and nifurtimox interfere with trypanothione synthesis and activity at different stages. There is also experimental evidence that combinations of suramin and stage II drugs might be beneficial. Therefore by reducing the overall dosage of each individual component, drug combinations could reduce the frequency of serious adverse effects as well as the selection for resistance. Based on this concept, important progress was made in 2009 by a multi-center trial testing a combination of nifurtimox and eflornithine. NECT (nifurtimox–eflornithine combination therapy) has now fulfilled its potential for being the preferred first-line treatment for stage II *T. b. gambiense* HAT[.10](#page-6-9) The drug combination is released as fully equipped kits, thus facilitating its use.

#### New Drug Developments

Drugs with fewer adverse effects, better applicability, and reliable availability are urgently needed and have been identified as a priority for research and development in tropical medicine.

Recently a new oral treatment for all stages of *T. b. gambiense* HAT had been introduced. Fexinidazole is a 2-substituted 5-nitroimidazole, which proved to be effective and safe compared with NECT[.11](#page-6-10) This is a new step forward, developed by the Drugs for Neglected Disease Initiative (DNDI), with a potential to greatly facilitate the management of HAT in the future.

Another new chemical entity, oxaborole, has just entered phase II/III trials.[12](#page-6-11)

# **PREVENTION**

# **Individual Protection**

Pentamidine or suramin chemoprophylaxis is of historical interest and can no longer be recommended. Insect repellents are only of limited use, as tsetse flies are visually attracted to their prey. Long-sleeved, bright (but not blue) clothing is the best defense against attacking tsetse flies. Infested strips of land are often well known to the local population and should be avoided as much as possible. Even in foci of disease, less than 1% of the flies are infective, so HAT among tourists and occasional visitors to endemic areas is rare, although it continues to be reported in returned travelers, especially from game parks in Tanzania and Zambia.

#### **Control in Endemic Areas**

In the past, tremendous efforts were undertaken to control the threat posed by sleeping sickness to human lives and economic development in rural Africa. Control programs are based on a combination of treatment of patients, mass screening, and vector control, usually by trapping and insecticide spraying. The most important strategy is active case finding. This requires mobile teams, which regularly visit villages in endemic areas. Mostly based on the results of CATT screening, patients in the early stage of the disease are identified and treated before they fuel the transmission cycle. Gradually, the parasite reservoir is depleted. As *Glossina* is a relatively incompetent vector and susceptible to control measures such as insecticide application or trapping, the combination of various approaches can lead to a complete interruption of transmission. This had been achieved in the past in many places, and some recent successes have been accomplished, usually through the cooperation between the WHO, national control programs and committed non-governmental organizations (Democratic Republic of Congo, Angola, Uganda). Today, HAT is on the list of diseases for elimination, and currently fewer than 3000 cases have been reported per year.

However, the resurgence of sleeping sickness in areas ridden by war and civil unrest in the last 25 years, in combination with the decreasing availability of drugs, gives rise to the fear that HAT will still continue to be a severe public health problem in the future.
