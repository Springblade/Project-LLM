# KEY FEATURES

- • Crimean-Congo hemorrhagic fever (CCHF) is a rare tick-borne viral hemorrhagic fever occurring infrequently in Africa, Asia, and Europe. Modern synonyms include Central Asian hemorrhagic fever, Kara mikh typhoid fever (ميخ ه قر حصبه (in Iran, and Xīnjiāng hemorrhagic fever (新疆出血热) in China.
- • CCHF is caused by the orthonairovirus Crimean-Congo hemorrhagic fever virus (CCHFV).
- • CCHFV is predominantly transmitted through *Hyalomma* tick bites or through direct contact with infected mammals, including humans or their tissues, excretions, or secretions. Infected mammals may be asymptomatic despite viremia and may transmit the virus during this period to ticks or other mammals, including humans.
- • CCHFV infection may be asymptomatic or result in viral hemorrhagic fever with severe hemorrhage subsequent to a short incubation period (3–6 days) and a pre-hemorrhagic phase.
- • Lethality (5%–50%) depends on various factors, including severity of hemorrhage, viral load, patient access to health care facilities, standard of supportive care, and availability of (candidate) anti-virals.
- • Ribavirin treatment of CCHF is controversial among experts, but is recommended by the World Health Organization (WHO). A vaccine to prevent CCHFV infection is only available in Bulgaria.

# **INTRODUCTION**

The disease now known as Crimean-Congo hemorrhagic fever (CCHF) has probably been encountered by humans since the early 12th century in the area of what today is Tajikistan[.1](#page-2-0) The disease was first described in the medical literature in 1945 as a tick-borne viral hemorrhagic fever that affected Crimean peasants during the 1944 crop-harvesting season[.2](#page-2-1) The virus responsible for these cases was first isolated in 1967 in laboratory mice. In 1969, this virus was shown to be identical to a virus isolated in 1956 from a febrile child in Stanleyville, Belgian Congo. The disease name CCHF was chosen to honor these linked discoveries, and this name has been maintained to the present by the World Health Organization's (WHO) International Classification of Disease 10 (ICD-10: A98.0)[.3](#page-2-2) Today, Crimean-Congo hemorrhagic fever virus (CCHFV) is classified as the only member of the species *Orthonairovirus* in the family *Nairoviridae*, order *Bunyavirales*.

# **EPIDEMIOLOGY**

CCHF cases have been reported in Africa (Burkina Faso, Democratic Republic of the Congo, Kenya, Mauritania, Republic of the Congo, Senegal, South Africa, Sudan, Tanzania, Uganda), Asia (Afghanistan, Armenia, China, Georgia, India, Iran, Iraq, Kazakhstan, Kuwait, Kyrgyzstan, Oman, Pakistan, Russia, Saudi Arabia, Tajikistan, Turkey, Turkmenistan, United Arab Emirates, Uzbekistan), and Europe (Albania, Bulgaria, Greece, Hungary, Kosovo, Macedonia, Russia, Serbia, Spain, Serbia, Turkey, Ukraine)[.1,3–6](#page-2-0) Furthermore, evidence exists for CCHFV endemicity in countries from which cases have not yet been reported (Algeria, Benin, Central African Republic, Egypt, Ethiopia, Kuwait, Madagascar, Morocco, Nigeria, Romania, Somalia, Tunisia, Zimbabwe). However, the absolute annual CCHV case numbers and frequency of occurrence and/or transmission of CCHFV infections remain unclear for many of the listed countries due to lack of robust surveillance systems and/or the lack of diagnostic capabilities beyond reliance on clinical presentation and serologic assays[.3,6](#page-2-2). The only very recent discovery of CCHFV in Spain indicates that CCHFV must be viewed as an emerging pathogen that ought to be considered in the differential diagnosis even in countries that currently are not known to be endemic.

# **ECOLOGY AND TRANSMISSION**

In nature, CCHFV is maintained trans-ovarially (to the next generation) or trans-stadially (among developmental stages) in predominantly hard (ixodid) ticks of the genus *Hyalomma.* The geographic distribution of these and other infected ticks determines areas of risk for human infection[.1](#page-2-0) Infected ticks may transmit the virus to hares, hedgehogs, and ground squirrels (susliks), but also to cattle, goats, ostriches, and sheep, all of which typically remain asymptomatic. Naïve ticks feeding on infected livestock then complete the infectious cycle. The role of migratory birds in the CCHFV transmission cycle is unclear because, typically, they are refractory to CCHFV infection, but these birds can potentially transfer infected ticks from one location to another. Humans may become accidental virus hosts after tick bites or after having direct contact with infected animals, including humans, or their tissues, excretions, or secretions [\(Fig. 37.5.1A\)](#page-1-0). Consequently, certain human populations are at high risk of CCHFV infection. These populations include health care professionals who are in touch with asymptomatically infected people or with CCHF patients, burial professionals, individuals who are active outdoors in tickinfested areas, household contacts of CCHFV-infected people, veterinarians, butchers, and abattoir workers.[3](#page-2-2)

# **DISEASE PRESENTATION**

CCHF typically has an incubation phase of 1 to 13 days. The disease begins suddenly with a pre-hemorrhagic (influenza-like) phase characterized by high fever, rigors, headache, dizziness, photophobia, malaise, nausea, abdominal pain, vomiting, arthralgia, myalgia, sore throat, and non-bloody diarrhea [\(Fig. 37.5.1B\)](#page-1-0). In severe cases, the disease progresses around days 3 to 6 after disease onset to a rapidly developing hemorrhagic phase with a duration of 2 to 3 days. Hemorrhagic signs (associated with a poor prognosis) include petechiae on trunk and limbs to extended ecchymosis ([Fig. 37.5.1C\)](#page-1-0), epistaxis, frank hemorrhage from mucosal membranes (vaginal, gastrointestinal), hematemesis, hematuria, melena, and hemoptysis. Patients may show signs of disseminated intravascular coagulation (DIC), circulatory shock, and end-organ damage, including kidney and liver impairment. CCHF patients are typically characterized by increased alanine aminotransferase (ALT), aspartate aminotransferase (AST), creatine kinase (CK), γ-glutamyl transferase (GGT), and lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) concentrations; prolonged prothrombin and activated partial

CCHFV is maintained in an enzootic transmission cycle in predominantly ixodid ticks, which may change location via migratory birds that do not get infected. Ticks may transmit CCHFV to non-primate mammals and ostriches or directly to people; people can also become infected by having direct contact with infected animals, including humans.

thromboplastin times; increased bilirubin and creatinine concentrations; leukocytosis; thrombocytopenia; and presence of fibrin degradation products. Survivors may develop sequelae, including labile pulse, anorexia, tachycardia, temporary complete alopecia, polyneuritis, dyspnea, xerostomia, poor vision, loss of hearing, and poor memory.<sup>3,7</sup>

### **PATHOGENESIS**

The pathogenesis of CCHF is not well understood but is hypothesized to be similar to the pathogenesis of other viral hemorrhagic fevers. Accordingly, CCHFV would first replicate locally in monocytoid and other cells before spreading to lymph nodes and then throughout the body via the blood and lymphatic systems. Dysregulation of the vascular system, lymphoid organs, and host immune response are thought to be the direct result of CCHFV replication in the

liver and adrenals, which often become necrotic. The resulting coagulopathy and increased endothelial permeability are due to CCHFV replication in blood vessel endothelia. Alternatively, CCHFV-induced up-regulation of cytokines that increase vascular permeability, immune complex deposition, and complement activation could explain the hemorrhagic phase of CCHF, including hypovolemic shock. Hemophagocytosis has been observed and could explain the CCHF-typical cytopenias during the acute phase.<sup>3,8</sup>

#### LABORATORY DIAGNOSIS

The laboratory diagnosis of CCHF is complicated by the fact that CCHFV is classified as a World Health Organization (WHO) Risk Group 4 pathogen, therefore requiring maximum containment laboratory settings for live virus culture (typically in Vero cells), animal inoculation (typically intra-cerebral into suckling laboratory

mice), or examination of non-sterilized materials. Thus, reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) and quantitative RT-PCR using inactivated samples are the gold standards of diagnosis, but PCR diagnosis is still not available in many rural laboratories of countries where CCHFV may be endemic. In these cases, anti-CCHFV IgG and IgM can be detected by (relatively insensitive) immunofluorescence assay (IFA) or enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA), usually within 7 days after onset of infection. A single positive IgM test or a paired fourfold increase in IgG titer during the course of disease is a good indicator of acute CCHFV infection[.3,9](#page-2-2)

# **DIFFERENTIAL DIAGNOSIS**

The differential diagnosis of CCHF is complex and is highly dependent on where the disease is recognized and the availability of travel and occupational histories. The pre-hemorrhagic phase of CCHF has an etiology-independent presentation, and differential diagnosis therefore includes any acute febrile illness. A history of a tick bite should trigger the inclusion of borrelioses, ehrlichiosis, rickettsioses, and Q fever in the differential diagnosis. The hemorrhagic phase may be an indication of any viral hemorrhagic fever, including Alkhurma hemorrhagic fever, Ebola virus disease, hemorrhagic fever with renal syndrome, Kyasanur Forest disease, Marburg virus disease, Lassa fever, Rift Valley fever, severe dengue, severe fever with thrombocytopenia syndrome, and yellow fever[.3,10](#page-2-2) General sepsis may also mimic CCHF, as may other conditions such as malaria, leptospirosis, viral hepatitis, congenital coagulopathies, poisonings, or snake bites.

# **TREATMENT**

Due to the absence of approved CCHFV-specific anti-virals, treatment almost always has to be supportive in nature. The degree of supportive care is necessarily based on disease severity and the available standard of care in hospitals. Some CCHF patients may only need fluid hydration and/or electrolyte replacement, whereas others may require blood, platelet, and/or fresh frozen plasma transfusions. Patients in the hemorrhagic phase of CCHF may develop hypovolemic shock and, therefore, require aggressive fluid replacement and administration of vasopressors in intensive-care settings. End-organ damage may be a consequence of shock and require hemodialysis, long-term ventilation, or even organ replacement. Endoscopy and minor or major surgeries might be indicated to control bleeding. Finally, antimicrobials might have to be administered to treat superinfections. The administration of the generic anti-viral ribavirin is hotly debated as a means to control CCHFV infection. Finally, hyperimmune globulin may be efficacious against CCHF, but is not readily available.[3,11,12](#page-2-2)

# **PREVENTION**

The most effective measure to prevent CCHFV infection is the avoidance of tick-infested areas, donning of proper clothing and other measures to prevent tick bites (including arthropod repellents); regular screening for tick bites with rapid and proper removal of the tick; and donning of appropriate personal protective equipment in professional settings such as hospitals, butcheries, and abattoirs. Local educational campaigns can and should be undertaken to increase knowledge and awareness regarding the modes of CCHFV transmission and simple and effective ways to prevent infection. Patient isolation and contact tracing in outbreak settings can help reduce case numbers and, together with preventive measures, ultimately can terminate outbreaks[.3,13](#page-2-2)

# **POST-EXPOSURE PROPHYLAXIS**

Thus far, ribavirin is the only measure that has been experimentally used as post-exposure prophylaxis after potential CCHFV exposure.[3,11](#page-2-2)

# **VACCINES**

A U.S. Food and Drug Administration–approved human vaccine is not available, but a Soviet vaccine has been licensed and used in Bulgaria since 1974 for military personnel and medical and agricultural workers[.13,14](#page-2-4) The efficacy of this vaccine has not been established by randomized clinical trials and is, therefore, in doubt. Modern vaccine development has been severely hindered by the absence of suitable CCHF animal models[.11,15](#page-2-5)
