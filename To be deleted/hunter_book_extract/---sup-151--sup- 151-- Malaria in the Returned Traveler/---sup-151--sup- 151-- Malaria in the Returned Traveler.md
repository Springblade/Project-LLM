# **<sup>151</sup> 151** Malaria in the Returned Traveler

*David G. Lalloo*

### KEY FEATURES

- • *Plasmodium falciparum* malaria is a potential medical emergency, as patients can deteriorate rapidly; patients with suspected malaria should be evaluated immediately.
- • Symptoms of malaria are often non-specific. There are no typical clinical features of malaria; even fever is not invariably present. Malaria in children (and sometimes in adults) may present with misleading symptoms such as gastrointestinal features, sore throat, or lower respiratory complaints.
- • A careful exposure history is necessary: country and area of travel, including stopovers, date of return, date of symptoms, and details of prophylaxis (if any).
- • *P. falciparum* malaria is most likely to occur within the first 1 to 3 months of return from an endemic area. The incubation period is at least 6 days.
- • Three negative slides over a period of 48 to 72 hours are necessary to exclude malaria.
- • Consider other travel-related infections: typhoid, hepatitis, dengue, influenza, acute HIV, meningitis/ encephalitis, and viral hemorrhagic fevers.
- • Treatment should be started promptly with artemisinin combination treatments for uncomplicated falciparum malaria and IV artesunate for severe malaria.

#### **INTRODUCTION**

Malaria is one of the most important illnesses in the returned traveler. It accounts for a large proportion of the patients admitted with a fever after foreign travel and has the potential to cause a rapidly fatal illness. Recognition and prompt management of the disease by physicians at all levels of the system are important.

#### **EPIDEMIOLOGY**

In the United States, the number of imported cases of malaria has increased steadily over the last 20 years, with over 1700 cases—1145 in U.S. residents—reported in 2014.[1](#page-3-0) In contrast, the number of reported malaria cases has remained stable in Europe, at approximately 6500 to 7000 per year since 2011[.2](#page-3-1) The UK and France alone represent over half the total reported cases, related to their large immigrant populations from the African subcontinent.[3](#page-3-2) The majority of imported cases of malaria in Europe and North America (60%–80%) are caused by *Plasmodium falciparum* with a further 10% to 25% being due to *P. vivax*. [1,3–5](#page-3-0) Those most at risk include recent immigrants or foreign visitors and people visiting friends and relatives in their country of origin[.1,5,6](#page-3-0) Appropriate pre-travel advice and education about recognition of symptoms of malaria on return from endemic countries is particularly important in this latter group. Travelers to sub-Saharan Africa have the highest risk: *P. falciparum* malaria is the most common post-travel diagnosis in this group.[7–9](#page-3-3) Most deaths from malaria in Western countries are associated with delays in the recognition of the disease by patients and health personnel. Therefore the importance of a thorough travel history for all febrile patients needs to be emphasized.

# **CLINICAL FEATURES**

### **Uncomplicated Malaria**

There are few specific symptoms or signs of malaria. Fever, or a history of fever, may be associated with non-specific malaise, chills or rigors, respiratory symptoms, or gastrointestinal upset. Children are more likely to present with non-specific symptoms (fever, lethargy, malaise, somnolence) or gastrointestinal symptoms (nausea, abdominal pain, vomiting, diarrhea).[10,11](#page-4-0) A classical fever pattern, such as an alternate-day spike with *P. vivax,* is rarely seen. In patients with a history of fever, the presence of splenomegaly, jaundice, or thrombocytopenia makes malaria more likel[y12;](#page-4-1) hepatomegaly or splenomegaly is more common in children. Most missed malaria infections are erroneously diagnosed as non-specific viral infections, influenza, gastroenteritis, or hepatitis.

Practitioners should have a high index of suspicion for malaria in anyone who has returned from an endemic area in the last year: the minimum incubation period is 6 days. Nearly all patients with *P. falciparum* malaria will present within 3 months of exposure, and most do so in the first month after return.[8,13](#page-4-2) Other species of malaria may present much later after exposure, with almost a quarter of *P. vivax* cases being delayed for over a year[.13](#page-4-3) Individuals who may have taken suboptimal chemoprophylaxis regimens or were not completely adherent to their regimen may have a subacute or insidious onset of clinical symptoms. Presentation may be delayed compared with those who have not taken prophylaxis[.14](#page-4-4) Parasitemias may be low or intermittent, making conformation by microscopy difficult.

#### **Severe or Complicated Malaria**

Severe malaria should be considered a medical emergency. The clinical manifestations of severe malaria in returned travelers are similar to those in endemic regions [\(Table 151.1](#page-1-0)). Cerebral malaria and respiratory distress predominate in children; severe anemia tends to be less common than in endemic populations. In adults, cerebral malaria, respiratory distress syndrome, and multi-organ failure, including renal failure, predominate. Pregnant women, those who have lost their spleen, and patients with advanced HIV are at higher risk of severe malaria. Severe or complicated malaria is usually associated with *P. falciparum* infection, but there is growing evidence that a small proportion of patients with *P. vivax* and *P. knowlesi* infection develop severe malaria.[15,16](#page-4-5)

# **PATIENT EVALUATION AND DIFFERENTIAL DIAGNOSIS**

The major issue to consider in the diagnosis of anyone with fever following travel is to take an appropriate exposure history. Many patients from an endemic area consider themselves immune, but immunity is lost relatively rapidly after leaving an endemic area, and patients can still develop severe malaria.[17,18](#page-4-6) The most useful investigations are thick and thin blood films, or a rapid diagnostic test (RDT). In experienced hands, a thick film is more sensitive, but in many Western settings where microscopy experience is limited, RDTs are commonly reported and the diagnosis confirmed by a reference laboratory. If performed correctly, rapid tests are

<span id="page-1-0"></span>**TABLE 151.1** Features of Severe and Complicated Malaria

#### **ADULTS**

Impaired consciousness or seizures

Acidosis (pH <7.3)

Hypoglycemia (<2.2 mmol/L)

Pulmonary edema **or** acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS)

Renal impairment (oliguria <0.4 mL/kg bodyweight per hour or

creatinine >265 µmol/L) Hemoglobin ≤8 g/dL

Spontaneous bleeding/disseminated intravascular coagulation

Shock (algid malaria—BP <90/60 mmHg)

highly sensitive for the detection of *P. falciparum* malaria but can miss other species; newer-generation RDTs are better at detecting *P. vivax.* Blood films are still essential for confirming speciation and estimating the parasitemia, which has prognostic significance. Repeated blood films may be necessary to detect low parasitemias, particularly if patients have been taking chemoprophylaxis. At least three thick films taken over 24 to 48 hours should be examined before the diagnosis can be excluded.

A full blood count, urea and electrolytes, liver enzymes, and blood glucose should be taken routinely. If *P. vivax* or *P. ovale* is identified, testing should also be done for G6PD deficiency in anticipation of primaquine treatment. Mild anemia is common, and the presence of thrombocytopenia or hyperbilirubinemia is predictive of malaria[.13,19](#page-4-3) Elevation of hepatic transaminases and abnormalities of renal function can occur in more severe disease. Hypoglycemia commonly occurs in severe malaria, both as a consequence of the disease and, if the patient has been treated with quinine, quinine-induced hyperinsulinemia; hypoglycaemia is most problematic in children or pregnancy. In severe disease, elevated lactate levels are common, and clotting function should be evaluated to detect the rare cases who develop disseminated intravascular coagulation. Blood cultures should be taken; gramnegative bacteremia can be a complication of severe malaria, particularly in children. A lumbar puncture should be performed in those with impaired consciousness to exclude meningitis or encephalitis: significantly raised cerebrospinal fluid white cell counts are rare in cerebral malaria.

The differential diagnosis of malaria in the returned traveler is wide and is essentially that of a febrile illness. A detailed travel history, including precise destinations visited, duration of visit and activities while abroad, and preventive measures taken, can help determine the likelihood of malaria. The most important differential diagnoses to be considered are typhoid, arboviral diseases, including dengue, and the rare hemorrhagic fevers, which are important to consider because of their public health significance (e.g., the need for isolation).

### **TREATMENT**

Most of the evidence for managing malaria comes from the endemic setting. The strength of the evidence for the treatment of malaria in all settings is summarized in World Health Organization (WHO) guidelines[20](#page-4-7) and in Chapter 101.

#### **UNCOMPLICATED DISEASE**

There are a number of options for the management of uncomplicated malaria ([Tables 151.2, 151.3, and 151.4](#page-1-2)). The choice of

anti-malarial depends on the species of malaria and the geographic region where the infection is likely to have been acquired. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) has produced guidelines for treatment in the United States[,21](#page-4-8) and other regions, including the UK, Canada, and Europe, have all produced treatment guidelines.[22–24](#page-4-9) Malaria should be managed in consultation with someone experienced in this. In the United States, advice can be obtained from the CDC's Emergency Operations Center at (770) 488–7100.

#### **Non-Falciparum Malaria**

Chloroquine has been traditionally used for the treatment of all non-falciparum species and still remains highly effective for treating *P. ovale, P. malariae,* and *P. knowlesi* infection (see [Table 151.2](#page-1-2)). However, there is increasing evidence of the spread of chloroquine resistance in *P. vivax* acquired in some regions of the Pacific and Southeast Asia, particularly Papua New Guinea and Indonesia[.25](#page-4-10) Either an artemisinin combination therapy (ACT) or chloroquine can be used to treat the blood forms of all non-falciparum species; there is some evidence, particularly from *P. vivax* infection, that fever and parasite clearance may be faster with an ACT[.26,27](#page-4-11) An ACT may be preferred for *P. vivax* infections from regions where chloroquine resistance is common. Patients with mixed infections or uncertainty about the infecting species should be treated as though they have falciparum malaria.

Patients with *P. ovale* or *P. vivax* infection also require treatment to eradicate hepatic hypnozoites: relapse may occur in 10% to 100% of patients with *P. vivax* who are treated with chloroquine alone, depending on the strain and geographic area where infection was acquired. Primaquine is the main drug that is used for radical cure; tafenoquine which can be administered as a single dose has just been licensed. Higher doses of primaquine (30 mg [base] daily for 14 days) are needed for *P. vivax* than for *P. ovale* (15 mg daily), and patients should be tested for G6PD deficiency before administration. Anti-relapse therapy with primaquine is more effective if administered simultaneously with chloroquine during the

#### **Falciparum Malaria**

Malaria caused by *P. falciparum* needs to be treated promptly because of the potential for patients to deteriorate and develop severe disease (see [Tables 151.3](#page-2-2) and [151.4](#page-2-3)). There are several choices for treatment of uncomplicated falciparum malaria, but ACTs are the drug of choice in view of the substantial endemic data showing that ACTs reduce parasitemia more rapidly. Artemether–lumefantrine is licensed in the United States and Europe; dihydroartemisinin–piperaquine is also licensed for use in Europe. In the absence of ACTs, there are three other main options: atovaquone–proguanil, quinine and doxycycline or clindamycin, and mefloquine. Atovaquone–proguanil is well tolerated and widely available due to its use as a prophylactic medication. Oral quinine should be accompanied by either doxycycline or clindamycin to ensure a full therapeutic response: most patients will complain of tinnitus. Mefloquine is least well tolerated in single-dose treatment dose[s31](#page-4-14) and is not effective for malaria from areas of Southeast Asia, where resistance is widespread. If mefloquine has to be used for treatment, a split dose is recommended for better tolerance, given as three tablets (750 mg) followed by a second dose of two tablets (500 mg) given 6 to 12 hours later. Chloroquine is a potential additional choice but is only effective for *P. falciparum* treatment in those limited areas where *P. falciparum* remains sensitive: parts of central America, Haiti and the Dominican Republic, and parts of the Middle East. Patients with uncomplicated *P. falciparum* malaria should be observed closely, and many physicians suggest that they should be managed as in-patients in the initial stages.

#### **Severe Disease**

#### Chemotherapy

Parenteral therapy should be given to all those with severe or complicated malaria and to those who cannot tolerate oral therapy ([Table 151.5](#page-3-4)). Many clinicians also advocate parenteral therapy <span id="page-3-4"></span>**TABLE 151.5** Drug Management of Severe Malaria in Travelers (Adults and Children)

- • Artesunate: 2.4 mg/kg given IV at 0, 12, and 24 h then daily thereafter. Treatment can be completed with a full course of an ACT, atovaquone–proguanil, or quinine and doxycycline or clindamycin.
- • Quinine: loading dose of 20 mg/kg quinine dihydrochloride in 5% dextrose or dextrose saline over 4 h. Followed by 10 mg/kg over 4 h every 8 h for first 48 h (or until patient can swallow). Frequency of dosing should be reduced to every 12 h if intravenous quinine continues for more than 48 h.
- • Quinidine: loading dose of 10 mg/kg quinidine gluconate IV over 1–2 h then continuous infusion of 0.02 mg/kg/min for at least 24 h. Alternatively, 24 mg/kg quinidine gluconate IV over 4 h, followed by 12 mg/kg over 4 h every 8 h.
- • If quinine or quinidine given, parenteral therapy is normally followed by oral quinine to complete 5–7 days treatment along with 7 days of doxycycline or clindamycin (pregnancy, children). Atovaquone– proguanil or a full course of an artemisinin combination treatment (ACT) can also be used.

for those with high levels of parasitemia (>2%). There is substantial evidence that parenteral artesunate reduces mortality compared with quinine in children and adults in endemic settings; artesunate should be the drug of choice for the management of severe malaria in the returned traveler.[32](#page-4-15)

The major issue with intravenous artesunate is the lack of a licensed product in either Europe or the United States, although the drug has orphan status in both jurisdictions. In the United States, a formulation of intravenous artesunate manufactured in accordance with Good Manufacturing Practice is available as an investigational new drug via the CDC; elsewhere, local health authorities have developed mechanisms to quality-assure imported artesunate, and the product is widely available through specialist importers. Artesunate should be given as a slow intravenous infusion at 0, 12, and 24 hours and then daily until oral medication can be taken. Each treatment dose is 2.4 mg/kg with no modification for altered renal status. Treatment should be completed with a full course of an oral ACT, atovaquone–proguanil, or quinine– doxycycline. Increasing use of artesunate in Western settings suggests that it is well tolerated, although delayed hemolysis appears to be relatively common 7 to 21 days post-treatment, and full blood counts should be monitored 14 days after treatment.[33,34](#page-4-16)

If not available, or if administration of artesunate is likely to be delayed, therapy should be started with intravenous quinine or quinidine (see [Table 151.5\)](#page-3-4) using a loading dose followed by infusion three times a day (quinine) or continuous infusion (quinidine). The electrocardiogram should be monitored continuously, and if parenteral therapy is continued for more than 48 hours, the dose should be reduced. Once the patient is well enough, oral quinine should be commenced to complete at least 5 days of treatment. Quinine or quinidine should be combined with 7 days of either doxycycline or clindamycin (children or pregnant women) to ensure full cure. A full course of atovaquone–proguanil or an ACT could also be used to complete treatment.

#### Supportive Therapy

In addition to chemotherapy, supportive treatment of the patient is extremely important. Patients with severe or complicated malaria or with high parasite counts (>2%) need careful observation in a high-dependency or intensive care unit. Blood glucose should be closely monitored and corrected if low. Achieving an optimum fluid balance is also important: under-perfusion may exacerbate hyperlactatemia, whereas fluid overload can contribute to pulmonary edema and respiratory distress syndrome in adults; much of the lactic acidosis in severe malaria appears to be due to microvascular obstruction rather than hypovolemia.[35](#page-4-17) In children, slow volume replacement is important; fluid boluses were associated with worse outcomes.[36](#page-4-18) Patients with anemia may need transfusion. Broad-spectrum antibiotics may be appropriate in adults with shock and should be considered in all children with severe malaria until gram-negative bacteremia can be excluded. Patients with renal failure may require hemofiltration[.37](#page-4-19)

# Adjunctive Treatment

Although many adjunctive treatments have been studied in severe malaria, none have been proven effective and none are indicated in routine clinical practice. Exchange transfusion has been most extensively studied with anecdotal success but has never been evaluated in a randomized, controlled trial. Before the availability of artesunate, many experienced clinicians advocated exchange transfusion for those with hyperparasitemia of more than 20% or in patients with parasitemia >10% and signs of severe disease. Given the broad stage specificity of artesunate and its rapid effect in reducing parasitemia, there does not now appear to be a role for exchange transfusion in the management of severe malaria.

#### **MONITORING AND PROGNOSIS**

There is little value in measuring parasite counts more frequently than daily, as variations in peripheral *P. falciparum* parasitemia occur according to the stage of the infection. Most patients who do not have very high initial parasite counts should clear peripheral parasites by 72 hours after the start of treatment. Those with uncomplicated malaria usually recover without sequelae, although fatigue and mild anemia can take a number of weeks to resolve. The case-fatality rate of *P. falciparum* malaria in U.S. travelers from 1966 to 1987 was 3.8% (66 deaths/1760 cases); more recent data from 25,000 UK cases demonstrated an overall case-fatality rate of 0.73%, and French data from 1996 to 2003 suggest a case-fatality rate of 0.4%[.38–40](#page-4-20) Approximately 7% to 15% of those with severe and complicated malaria die, depending on how severe malaria is defined. There is a clear influence of age upon the risk of death; the UK study showed that mortality increases steadily with age, with a case-fatality rate of 4.6% in those over 65 and an adjusted odds ratio of dying of malaria of 10.68 (95% confidence intervals 6.4–17.8, *P* <0.001) in those >65 years old compared with the >18- to 35-year-old group[.39](#page-4-21) Death rates in those >60 years of age was six times higher than in younger age groups in another European study.[41](#page-4-22) Mortality among infants and children with imported malaria is rare.[39,42](#page-4-21) Although most deaths are due to *P. falciparum,* there is also clear evidence that the chance of a fatal outcome from *P. vivax* infection increases with age.[43](#page-4-23) Subtle neurologic sequelae can follow cerebral malaria in children, diminishing over time, but sequelae are rare in adults.
