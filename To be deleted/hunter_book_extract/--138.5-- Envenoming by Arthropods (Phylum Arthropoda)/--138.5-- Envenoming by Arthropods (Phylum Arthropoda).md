# **138.5** Envenoming by Arthropods (Phylum Arthropoda)

*David A. Warrell*

## **TICKS (CLASS ARACHNIDA, SUBCLASS ACARI)**

## **Taxonomy and Epidemiology**

Ticks, along with mites, form the subclass Acari of the class Arachnida. Adult females of about 34 species of hard tick (family Ixodidae) and immature specimens of 9 species of soft ticks (family Argasidae) have been implicated in human tick paralysis. The tick's saliva contains a neurotoxin that causes presynaptic neuromuscular block and decreased nerve-conduction velocity. The tick embeds itself in the skin with its barbed hypostome, introducing the salivary toxin while it engorges with blood.[1](#page-8-0)

Although tick paralysis has been reported from all continents, most cases occur in western North America (*Dermacentor andersoni*), eastern United States (*D. variabilis*), eastern Australia from north Queensland to Victoria (*Ixodes holocyclus,* known as the bush, scrub, paralysis, or dog tick), and Tasmania and Victoria (*I. cornuatus,* the Tasmanian paralysis tick). In British Columbia, Canada, there were 305 cases with a 10% case fatality rate between 1900 and 1968. About 120 cases have been reported in the United States, and in New South Wales (Australia), there were at least 20 deaths between 1900 and 1945[.2,3](#page-8-1)

# **Clinical Feature[s4](#page-8-2)**

Ticks are picked up in the countryside or from domestic animals, particularly dogs, in the home. The majority of patients and almost all fatal cases are children. After the tick has been attached for 5 to 6 days, a progressive ascending, lower motor neuron paralysis develops with paresthesia. Often, a child, who may have been irritable for the previous 24 hours, falls on getting out of bed first thing in the morning and is found to be weak or ataxic. Paralysis increases over the next few days: death results from bulbar and respiratory paralysis and aspiration of stomach contents. Vomiting is a feature of the more acute course of *I. holocyclus* envenoming.

This clinical picture was often misinterpreted as poliomyelitis. Other neurologic conditions, including Guillain–Barré syndrome, paralytic rabies, Eaton–Lambert syndrome, myasthenia gravis, or botulism, may also be suspected. Diagnosis depends on finding the tick, which is likely to be concealed in a crevice, orifice, or hairy area of the body. The scalp is the most common place. Fatal tick paralysis has been caused by a tick attached to the tympanic membrane.

## **Treatment**

The tick must be located and detached without being squeezed (see [Fig. 138.4.3A and B\)](#page--1-0). It can be painted with ether, chloroform, paraffin, petrol, or turpentine, or prized out between the partially separated tips of a pair of small, curved forceps. After removal of the tick, there is usually a rapid and complete recovery; however, in Australia, patients have died even after the tick had been detached. Antivenoms are no longer produced.

## **SPIDERS (CLASS ARACHNIDA, ORDER ARANEAE)**

<span id="page-0-0"></span>All but one family of this enormous order are venomous, but envenoming by only a few species has proved dangerous to humans. Spiders bite with a pair of fangs, the chelicerae, to which the venom glands are connected.

Necrotic araneism is caused by recluse spiders: *Loxosceles* (family Sicariidae) (Fig. [138.5.1\)](#page-0-0). Neurotoxic araneism is caused by:

- • Black and brown widows: *Latrodectus* (family Theridiidae) ([Fig.](#page-1-0) [138.5.2](#page-1-0))
- • Wandering, armed, or banana spiders: *Phoneutria* (family Ctenidae) ([Fig. 138.5.3A and B\)](#page-1-1)
- • Sydney and other Australian funnel-web spiders: *Atrax, Hadronyche,* and *Missulena* spp. (Mygalomorphae, family Hexathelidae) ([Fig. 138.5.4](#page-1-2))

## **Epidemiology**

Spider bites are common in some parts of the world, but there are few fatalities, although some morbidity from *Loxosceles* bites has been reported. In 2016 Brazil reported 29,000 spider bites (14/100,000 population) with 25 deaths (case fatality rate 0.09%). In Central and South America, *Loxosceles* spp., such as *L. laeta* and *L. gaucho,* are widely distributed and cause many bites. In Chile, the case fatality of loxoscelism ranges from 1% to 17%. In the south and southcentral United States, the brown recluse spider, *L. reclusa,* caused at least 200 bites and six deaths in the country during the last century. In the Mediterranean region, North Africa, and Israel, bites by *L. rufescens* are reported. Most bites from *Loxosceles* spp. occur in bedrooms while people are asleep or dressing. In the United States a number of men were bitten on the genitalia while they sat on outdoor privies in which the spiders had spun their webs.

**Fig. 138.5.2** Black widow spider (*Latrodectus curacaviensis*), Brazil (© David A. Warrell).

<span id="page-1-0"></span>Black and brown widow spiders are cosmopolitan in distribution. *Latrodectus tredecemguttatus* (loosely referred to as "tarantula") lives in fields in Mediterranean countries. It has caused epidemics of bites. In Italy, 946 cases were reported between 1946 and 1951[.5](#page-8-3) *Latrodectus hasselti,* the Australian red back spider, causes more than 300 bites each year in Australia. Twenty deaths have been reported[.6,7](#page-8-4) In New Zealand, the katipo spider (*Latrodectus katipo*) causes very few bites. The black widow spider (*Latrodectus mactans*) was responsible for 63 deaths in the United States between 1950 and 1959. Many species of *Latrodectus* occur in Latin America.

Wandering, armed, or banana spiders (*Phoneutria* spp.) cause bites and a few deaths in Latin American countries. They have been imported into temperate countries in bunches of bananas, causing a few bites and deaths.

Highly dangerous funnel-web spiders (*Atrax* spp.) are restricted to southeastern Australia and Tasmania. The Sydney funnel-web (*Atrax robustus*) is restricted to a 160-mile (256-km) radius of Sydney. The aggressive males inflict about two bites per year and at least 13 deaths were reported between 1927 and 1980, all before introduction of a specific antivenom. Members of the related genera *Hadronyche* and *Missulena* may be equally dangerous.[8](#page-8-5)

In England, mild neurotoxic araneism has been described after bites by *Steatoda nobilis* and *S. grossa* (family Theridiidae)[9](#page-8-6) and woodlouse spiders (*Dysdera crocata,* family Dysderidae). Elsewhere, *S. grossa* (cosmopolitan) and *S. capensis* (South Africa, Australia, New Zealand, and Hawai'i) have caused envenoming.

## **Clinical Features**

Necrotic araneism appears as skin lesions varying in severity from mild, localized erythema and blistering to extensive chronic or recurrent granulomas and tissue necrosis. These features have been falsely attributed to a large variety of familiar peri-domestic species, such as the Australian white-tailed spider (*Lampona cylindrata*), North American hobo spider (*Tegenaria agrestis*), European and South American wolf spiders (*Lycosa*, including the Italian "tarantula" *Lycosa terentula*), and cosmopolitan sac spiders (Cheiracanthium)[.10](#page-8-7)

<span id="page-1-2"></span>However, only members of the genus *Loxosceles* can cause necrotic arachnidism/araneism[.11](#page-8-8) Venom sphingomyelinase D is implicated in the pathogenesis of dermonecrosis, which follows neutrophil adherence to the endothelium of cutaneous capillaries and degranulation. The bite itself is usually painless and unnoticed.

(A) Red-white-and-blue sign developing 7 hours after the bite, (B) necrotic lesion after 13 days, (C) eschar after 2 months (scale in cm) (© David A. Warrell).

<span id="page-2-0"></span>Burning develops over several hours at the site of the bite, with swelling and development of a characteristic macular lesion—the red-white-and-blue sign [\(Fig. 138.5.5A](#page-2-0)) showing concentric red vasodilatation, white vasoconstriction, and central blue pre-necrotic cyanosis. Full-thickness dermonecrosis develops ([Fig. 138.5.5B](#page-2-0)), and finally a blackened eschar ([Fig. 138.5.5C](#page-2-0)), which sloughs to leave a full-thickness necrotic ulcer. Sometimes, an entire limb or area of the face is involved. Facial bites cause much swelling. Some 13% of cases have systemic symptoms, such as fever, headache, scarlatiniform rash, jaundice, methemoglobinemia, and hemoglobinuria resulting from intravascular hemolysis. Acute kidney injury may ensue. The average case fatality is about 5%.

With neurotoxic araneism, the bite is immediately very painful but local signs are minimal (*L. mactans*) or moderate (*L. hasselti*). After about 30 minutes there is painful regional lymphadenopathy, then headache, nausea, vomiting, and local sweating with piloerection ("gooseflesh")—a sign highly suggestive of neurotoxic araneism. In cases of bites by *L. mactans* and *L. tredecemguttatus,* there is profuse generalized sweating and fever with painful muscle spasms, tremors, and rigidity. This may be sufficiently severe to impede respiration. The classic "facies latrodectismica" is an agonized grimace caused by facial spasm and trismus, associated with swollen eyelids, congested conjunctivae, flushing, and sweating. Abdominal rigidity may simulate an acute abdomen and prompt laparotomy. Other features include tachycardia, hypertension, restlessness, irritability, psychosis, priapism, and rhabdomyolysis. A localized or diffuse rash may appear several days later. Envenoming by *Phoneutria* and *Atrax* spp. produces similar, but usually more severe, features.

## **First-Aid Treatment**

In Australia, pressure immobilization (see Chapter 137.5) is recommended for bites by *A. robustus* and *Hadronyche* species.

## **Specific Treatment**

Antivenoms for envenoming by *Latrodectus* spp. are made in Australia, Mexico, South Africa, Brazil, and some other South American countries; for *Atrax* spp. in Australia[12](#page-8-9); for *Loxosceles* spp. in Peru, Brazil, Mexico, and Argentina; and for *Phoneutria* spp. in Brazil.

Despite decades of use, there is no decisive evidence for the effectiveness of *Loxosceles* antivenoms.[13](#page-8-10) Neurotoxic araneism appears more responsive to antivenom, but the effectiveness of antivenom for *L. hasselti* bites in Australia has been strongly challenged.[14](#page-8-11)

## **Supportive Treatment**

There is no convincing evidence for the effectiveness of any of the following, widely advocated ancillary treatments:

- • Oral dapsone (100 mg twice daily) to reduce the extent of necrotic lesions by inhibiting neutrophil degranulation.
- • Calcium gluconate (10 mL of a 10% solution, given by slow intravenous injection) to relieve the pain of muscle spasms caused by the venom of *Latrodectus* spp. rapidly and more effectively than muscle relaxants, such as diazepam or methocarbamol.
- • Antihistamines, corticosteroids, α-blockers, or atropine.
- • Early surgical debridement, corticosteroids, antihistamines, and hyperbaric oxygen for necrotic araneism caused by *Loxosceles* spp.

## **TARANTULA SPIDERS (MYGALOMORPHAE, FAMILY THERAPHOSIDAE)**

Tarantula spiders are increasingly popular pets, kept and bred by both children and adults in Western countries. The largest, the Goliath birdeater (*Theraphosa blondi*) of Venezuela and Brazil, weighs up to 150 g with a leg span of up to 30 cm. In human victims, a strike by the large vertically orientated fangs [\(Fig. 138.5.6](#page-3-0)) is powerful enough to penetrate a fingernail. However, despite their size, tarantulas are generally perceived to be harmless pets. Bites are uncommon but are under-reported.

New World tarantulas, such as the popular Mexican pink-/ orange-/red-kneed tarantula (*Brachypelma smithi*) and related species can eject urticating abdominal setae, causing kerato-uveal injuries ("ophthalmia nodosa") and irritation of the skin, nasopharynx,

<span id="page-3-0"></span>![](_page_3_Picture_13.jpeg)

**Fig. 138.5.6** Vertically placed venom jaws (25 mm long) of the East African king baboon tarantula (*Citharischius crawshayi,* Eumenophorinae, Theraphosidae). (Courtesy, Peter Kirk.)

and respiratory tract. Bites may cause allergic reaction, but envenoming appears to be clinically trivial, with the possible exception of a few genera, such as *Sericopelma* (Theraphosinae).

Old World tarantulas, which lack protective urticating hairs, bite more readily. In birds and mammals (as large as dogs), bites may be lethal.[15](#page-8-12) In humans, their bites are becoming recognized as potentially dangerous. Apart from intense local pain, inflammation, and swelling, severe systemic symptoms may ensue. Episodic, generalized, painful muscle cramps have been reported after bites by *Ornithoctoninae* spp.: orange-fringed (*Haplopelma doriae*) (Ornithoctoninae) from Borneo, African baboon tarantula (*Pterinochilus murinus*) (Harpactirinae), Indian ornamental tarantula (*Poecilotheria regalis*) (Poecilotheriinae), Southeast Asian and Australasian *Lampropelma* (Ornithoctoninae), *Eumenophorus* (Eumenophorinae), *Selenocosmia* (Selenocosmiinae,) and African *Stromatopelma* and *Heteroscodra* (Stromatopelminae)[.16,17](#page-8-13)

## **Treatment**

In the absence of any antivenom, muscle spasms can only be palliated with large doses of benzodiazepines and other muscle relaxants. Dantrolene might be considered.

## **Prevention**

The dangers of tarantula hairs and bites must be recognized, and tarantula keepers should be warned of the danger of handling these animals incautiously, especially after drinking alcohol.

## **SCORPIONS (CLASS ARACHNIDA, ORDER SCORPIONES, FAMILIES BUTHIDAE, HEMISCORPIIDAE)**

Potentially lethal scorpions occur in North Africa and the Middle East (*Androctonus, Buthus, Hemiscorpius* and *Leiurus* spp.) [\(Fig.](#page-3-1) [138.5.7\)](#page-3-1); South Africa (*Parabuthus* spp.); India and Nepal (*Hottentota tamulus*); North, Central, and South America; and Trinidad and Tobago (*Centruroides* and *Tityus* spp.) [\(Fig. 138.5.8](#page-4-0))[.18,19](#page-8-14) Scorpion toxins target Na<sup>+</sup> , K<sup>+</sup> , Ca2<sup>+</sup> , and Cl– ion channels, causing direct effects and the release of neurotransmitters, such as acetylcholine and catecholamines.[20,21](#page-8-15) Scorpions are nocturnally active arachnids that can be revealed in the dark using ultra-violet light which makes their exoskeleton fluoresce. In daytime, they can be found under loose bark, debris, rocks, and in the home in footwear, storage boxes, and piles of clothing on the floor.

## **Epidemiology**

In Mexico, there are 250,000 stings with fewer than 50 deaths/ year attributed to *Centruroides limpidus, C. noxius,* and *C. suffusus.*

In Khuzestan Province, Iran, 25,000 stings (*Hemiscorpius lepturus, Androctonus* and *Buthus* spp.) are treated each year. They are the fourth major cause of death. In Tunisia, there are about 40,000 stings per year, 1000 hospital admissions, and 100 deaths. In Arizona, 15,000 stings, mainly by Arizona bark scorpions (*C. sculpturatus*), are reported each year, but there have been no deaths in the United States since 1968. In Brazil, where important species are *Tityus serrulatus, T. bahiensis, T. obscurus,* and *T. stigmurus* (see [Fig.](#page-4-0) [138.5.8](#page-4-0)) and other *Tityus* spp., there were 90,000 reported stings, nearly three times the number of snakebites, with 138 deaths (case fatality rate 0.15%) in 2016. Since the early 2000s, these numbers have been increasing. In India, many people are stung by the red scorpion (*H. tamulus*) on the Konkan Coast of Maharashtra, with fatalities in adults and children.

## **Prevention**

Scorpions can be excluded from houses by incorporating a row of ceramic tiles into the base of the outside wall, making the doorsteps at least 20 cm high, and using residual insecticides, such as 1% lindane or dieldrin powders, indoors.

## **Clinical Features**

Buthid scorpion stings cause intense local pain with minimal local edema and tender enlargement of regional lymph nodes. However, stings by *H. lepturus* (Iran, Iraq, Pakistan, and Yemen) are relatively painless but cause local macular erythema, purpura, and bullae at the sting site with induration in 39% of cases, and swelling and necrosis that require surgery in 20% of cases.[22](#page-8-16) Systemic symptoms may develop within minutes or be delayed for as long as 24 hours. Many scorpion venoms stimulate the release of acetylcholine and catecholamines, often resulting in initial transient cholinergic and, later, prolonged adrenergic symptoms[.23](#page-9-0) Early symptoms include vomiting, profuse sweating, piloerection, alternating bradycardia and tachycardia, abdominal colic, diarrhea, loss of sphincter control, and priapism. Later, severe life-threatening cardiorespiratory effects may appear: hypertension, shock, tachyarrhythmias, and bradyarrhythmias, electrocardiogram (ECG) changes, and pulmonary edema with or without evidence of myocardial dysfunction. The clinical picture is similar to catecholamine myocarditis in pheochromocytoma[.24](#page-9-1) Severe cardiovascular complications are particularly associated with stings by *Androctonus* spp., *Leiurus quinquestriatus, Hottentota tamulus,* and *Tityus* spp. In Arizona,

*Centruroides sculpturatus* stings cause neurotoxic effects, such as erratic eye movements, fasciculation, and muscle spasms that can be misinterpreted as tonic-clonic convulsive movements, as well as respiratory distress. In southern Africa, *Parabuthus transvaalicus* envenoming is more likely to cause ptosis and dysphagia. Hemiplegia and other neurologic lesions have been attributed to fibrin deposition resulting from disseminated intravascular coagulation for example, after stings by *Nebo hierichonticus* in the Middle East. Hypercatecholaminemia could explain hyperglycemia and glycosuria, but in the case of stings by the black scorpion of Trinidad (*Tityus trinitatis*), there is severe abdominal pain with nausea, vomiting, hematemesis, hyperglycemia, and biochemical evidence of acute pancreatitis attributable to simultaneous spasm of the sphincter of Oddi and pancreatic exocrine hypersecretion[.25](#page-9-2) In Iran and Iraq, stings by *H. lepturus* (Hemiscorpiidae) produce a unique clinical syndrome. Systemic symptoms include dry mouth, thirst, dizziness, nausea, vomiting, fever, cardiac arrhythmias, ECG ST depression, hypoglycemia, confusion and convulsions, leukocytosis, thrombocytopenia, coagulopathy, hemolytic anemia with hemoglobinuria, proteinuria, and acute kidney injury (AKI). Twenty percent of pediatric cases require dialysis. Early treatment with Rhazi Institute antivenom proved effective.

## **Treatment**

The excruciating local pain responds temporarily to local infiltration, ring block, or intravenous regional anesthesia (Bier block) with local anesthetic. Although claimed to relieve pain, local injection of emetine or dehydroemetine may cause necrosis and systemic myotoxic effects and is not recommended. Parenteral opiate analgesics may be dangerous in patients with neurotoxic respiratory distress (e.g., after *C. sculpturatus* envenoming).

Antivenom is manufactured in several countries. In Arizona, in children stung by *C. sculpturatus,* antivenom achieved more rapid resolution of symptoms and less need for midazolam sedation than placebo.[26](#page-9-3) In India, two studies found that a new antivenom raised against *H. tamulus concanensis* venom produced more rapid recovery than prazosin alone.[27](#page-9-4) Antivenom is administered intravenously (IV) as soon as possible in patients with systemic envenoming and in young children stung by dangerous species, even before the development of these symptoms. Patients with cardiovascular symptoms may benefit from ancillary vasodilator treatment with prazosin (α1-blocker)[,28](#page-9-5) whereas those who develop left ventricular failure despite early prazosin therapy benefit from dobutamine. Atropine is reserved for cases of sinus bradycardia with hypotension. The use of cardiac glycosides and β-blockers is controversial.[29](#page-9-6) Benzodiazepines may be useful in patients with muscle spasms.

## **Wind Scorpions, Camel Spiders, or Sun Spiders (Arachnida, Order Solifugae)**

These arthropods are neither scorpions nor spiders, but nonvenomous solifuges. They may exceed 15 cm in length and have terrified foreign troops in Iraq and Afghanistan. In Turkana (northern Kenya), the local people believe that their bite can cause coma and hypersalivation. However, solifuges have no venom or venom apparatus, only formidable jaws. They are mainly nocturnal and seek shade during the day. This has led to the impression that they chase people when they are merely seeking the refuge of someone's shadow.

# **INSECTS (CLASS INSECTA)**

## <span id="page-5-0"></span>**Beetles (Order Coleoptera)**

The most notorious vesicating beetle is "Spanish fly"—*Lytta vesicatoria* (Meloidae, also called *blister beetles*). Its venom contains cantharidin, which causes blistering 2 to 3 hours after application to the skin and priapism (hence its reputation as an aphrodisiac) and AKI when given systemically or absorbed after eating the legs of frogs that have fed on meloid beetles.

"Nairobi eye" and similar blistering conditions in Australia and Southeast Asia are caused by species of the genus *Paederus* (Staphylinidae), which are 5 to 10 mm in length.[30,31](#page-9-7) The typical skin lesions (dermatitis linearis) [\(Fig. 138.5.9](#page-5-0)), whose appearance may be delayed 12 to 96 hours after contact, consist of erythema, itching, and blistering caused by inadvertently crushing and smearing the beetle. Systemic symptoms, such as fever, arthralgia, and vomiting, may arise in severe cases. The active principal, pederin, is the most complex non-proteinaceous insect toxin known. Treatment is palliative. The toxin is easily spread to other sites, such as the eye, by the fingers.

## **True Bugs (Order Hemiptera)**

Giant water bugs or water beetles (family Belastomatidae) [\(Fig.](#page-6-0) [138.5.10\)](#page-6-0) inhabit freshwater, especially in the Americas, and may swarm in large numbers in some urban areas. They may exceed 15 cm in length and have powerful mouth parts. Their bites can inject venomous saliva[32](#page-9-8) that prove lethal to vertebrates, including frogs, turtles, snakes, and birds, and can cause severe pulsatile pain radiating up the limb, redness, and swelling in human victims. Bites by other Hemiptera are alleged to cause systemic and even lethal effects.[33,34](#page-9-9) In North America, *Lethocerus americanus* is known as "toe biter" from its habit of attacking swimmers.

## <span id="page-6-0"></span>**Wasps, Bees, and Ants (Order Hymenoptera)** (See Also [Chapter 138.1](#page--1-1))

In non-sensitized people, a single sting, which, in the case of Vespidae and Apidae, introduces about 50 µg of venom, will rapidly produce a hot, red, painful swelling and weal a few centimeters in diameter, which persists for not more than a few hours. These effects are dangerous only if the airway is obstructed, for example, after stings on the tongue. However, as few as 30 bee or wasp stings can cause fatal systemic envenoming in children, although a few children and adults have survived more than 1000 stings by *Apis mellifera.*

## Epidemiology

Accidental release of African queen bees (*Apis mellifera scutellata*) in Brazil in 1957 resulted in the spread of this aggressive genotype throughout Latin America and as far north as Las Vegas, Nevada.[35](#page-9-10) An average of 30 deaths from mass attacks by these insects were reported each year at the height of the epidemic [\(Fig. 138.5.11](#page-6-1)). Fatal mass attacks by bees or wasps have been reported as uncommon events in Europe, Africa, Asia, and Australia.

## Clinical Features[36](#page-9-11)

Some patients have symptoms suggesting histamine toxicity: vasodilatation, hypotension, vomiting, diarrhea, throbbing headache, coma, and bronchoconstriction. In Latin America, victims of attacks by *A. m. scutellata* have shown evidence of generalized rhabdomyolysis (grossly elevated serum creatine kinase, aminotransferases, and myoglobin), intravascular hemolysis, hypercatecholaminemia (hypertension, pulmonary edema with hyaline membrane, myocardial damage), bleeding, hepatic dysfunction, and AKI. Mass vespid attacks can cause hepatic damage. In non-sensitized people, stings from *Solenopsis* and *Myrmecia* spp. produce pain, itching, swelling, and erythema around a central weal, which lasts a few hours, and later vesicles or pustules. In an unsensitized patient, an estimated 10,000 *Solenopsis invicta* stings caused no systemic envenoming. Multiple traumatic bites by soldiers of army, driver, safari ants, or siafu (genus *Dorylus,* subfamily Ecitoninae) may ulcerate and become secondarily infected.

## <span id="page-6-1"></span>Treatment

Severe envenoming from multiple stings by Hymenoptera should be treated with epinephrine (adrenaline), IV antihistamines, and corticosteroids (doses as noted earlier). Intensive care is essential. IV mannitol and bicarbonate may protect the kidneys from the damaging effects of myoglobinuria and hemoglobinemia ("pigment nephropathy"), as in patients with crush syndrome. Experimental antivenoms have been produced for bee envenoming but are not yet commercially available. Exchange transfusion or plasmapheresis might be considered to remove venom in severe cases. Renal dialysis is often needed.

## **Moths (Order Lepidoptera)**

The stinging abdominal hairs (barbed setae or "flechettes") of some species of adult female moths (genus *Hylesia* [\[Fig. 138.5.12A](#page-7-0)], family Saturniidae), which they use to protect their eggs, can cause contact dermatitis and urticaria ("lepidopterism"), whereas caterpillars of many species of moths can produce local, or even systemic, effects ("erucism")[.37](#page-9-12) Venomous lepidoptera are found in all parts of the world, but most cases of lepidopterism are reported from Central and South America.

Common causes of cutaneous urticating vesiculo-papular eruptions and upper respiratory and gastrointestinal tract irritation with a risk of hypersensitization and anaphylaxis are:

- • Caterpillars of oak processionary moths (*Thaumetopoea processionea,* family Thaumetopoeidae) in central/southern Europe[.38](#page-9-13)
- • "Puss caterpillars" of moths of the genus *Megalopyge* (Megalopygidae) in the southern United States and of the sycamore

<span id="page-7-1"></span>tussock moth *Halysidota harrisii* (Erebidae) of the eastern United States.

• Adult female yellowtail or ashen moths of the genus *Hylesia* (Saturniidae). Epidemics of stings by these moths have been described, especially from coastal areas of Brazil (see [Fig.](#page-7-0) [138.5.12B\)](#page-7-0), Peru, Venezuela, and Mexico, including in sailors and travelers[.39,40](#page-9-14)

#### Systemic envenoming:

• Caterpillars of the genus *Lonomia,* Saturniidae (*Lonomia obliqua, Lonomia achelous*) (Saturniid moths) ([Fig. 138.5.13A](#page-7-1)) cause thousands of stings each year in Venezuela, Colombia, Brazil, Peru, Paraguay, and French Guiana.[41](#page-9-15) In 2016 there were 3800 reported stings with four deaths. Venom injected through their bristles contains fibrinolytic (factor XIII activator), anti-coagulant, procoagulant (prothrombin, factor X, factor V activators), kallikrein-like metalloproteinase, and phospholipase A2 activities that cause defibrinogenation and spontaneous bleeding. Symptoms include local burning, erythema, swelling, inflammation, headache, nausea, vomiting, malaise, and extensive ecchymoses ([Fig. 138.5.13B](#page-7-1)); bleeding from the nose, gums, gut, genitourinary tract, and partly healed scars; polyarthralgia; and AKI[.42](#page-9-16) The case fatality of about 2% is usually attributable to cerebral hemorrhage. Laboratory findings in envenomed patients are decreased plasma fibrinogen, factor V, factor XIII, and plasminogen concentrations, as well as increased fibrin/ fibrinogen degradation products and fibrinolytic activity but a normal platelet count. A fatal imported case from Peru was reported in Canada[.43](#page-9-17) An effective antivenom ("Soro antilonômico") is produced by Instituto Butantan, São Paulo, Brazil.[44](#page-9-18)

• The stinging hairs of caterpillars (*Premolis semirufa*) can cause a disabling arthritis of the hands ("pararama") in rubber tappers in Pará State, Brazil, who are frequently in contact with them[.45](#page-9-19)

## **Centipedes and Millipedes (Subphylum Myriapoda)**

Centipedes (Class Chilopoda)

Epimorph centipedes have 15 to 191 pairs of legs and move rapidly and distractedly. They occur in most parts of the world, including the Arctic Circle. The largest, *Scolopendra gigantea* of South America, can grow to more than 30 cm in length. Many species can inflict painful stings through a pair of modified claws (forcipules) on the post-cephalic segment. More than 3000 stings are reported each year in Brazil. Venoms contain serotonin, histamine, lipids, polysaccharides, proteases, and peptides that are neurotoxic to insects. Stings cause intense radiating pain, swelling, inflammation, erythema and lymphangitis, and, sometimes, local necrosis. Systemic effects, such as vomiting, sweating, headache, cardiac arrhythmias, myocardial ischemia, rhabdomyolysis, proteinuria, acute renal failure, and convulsions, are extremely rare. The risk of mortality was probably greatly exaggerated in older literature. Hypersensitivity may have played a role in these reactions. Reports of documented fatalities remain elusive but are said to occur on some Indian Ocean islands. The most important genus is *Scolopendra,* which is distributed throughout tropical countries. Local treatment is the same as for scorpion stings. No antivenom is available.[20](#page-8-15)

# Millipedes (Class Diplopida[\)46,47](#page-9-20)

Millipedes are widely distributed. They may exceed 35 cm in length, have hundreds (not thousands) of legs, move sluggishly, and tend to coil into a ball. Most species possess glands in each of their body segments that secrete, and in some cases squirt out, irritant liquids for defensive purposes. These contain hydrogen cyanide and a variety of aldehydes, esters, phenols, and quinonoids. Members of at least eight genera of millipedes have proved injurious to humans. Important genera are *Rhinocricus* (Caribbean), *Spirobolus* (Tanzania and Papua New Guinea), *Spirostreptus* and *Iulus* (Indonesia), and *Polyceroconas* (*Salpidobolus*) (Papua New Guinea). Children are particularly at risk when they handle or try to eat these large arthropods. When venom is squirted into the eye, intense conjunctivitis results, and there may be corneal ulceration and, allegedly, blindness. Skin lesions initially stain brown ("mahogany stains") or purple, blister after a few days, and then peel ([Fig. 138.5.14](#page-8-17)). They have been mistaken for signs of child abuse. First aid is generous irrigation with water. Eye injuries should be treated as for snake venom ophthalmia (see Chapter 137.5).
