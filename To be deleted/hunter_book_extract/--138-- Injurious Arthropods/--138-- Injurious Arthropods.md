#### KEY FEATURES

- • Hymenoptera venom anaphylaxis: stings by bees, vespids, and ants may lead to hypersensitization and anaphylaxis, preventable by desensitization with purified venoms and treatable with epinephrine (adrenaline).
- • Bites by mosquitoes, midges, flies, and other arthropods and superficial infestations by fleas, lice, bedbugs, etc., are very common nuisances. They cause pruritus, papular urticaria, and secondary bacterial infections, and may result in hypersensitization.
- • Scabies remains prevalent in most parts of the world. It causes distressing symptoms and may be complicated by streptococcal infection leading to glomerulonephritis and rheumatic fever.
- • Skin, wounds, and body cavities may be invaded by fly larvae (myiasis) and adult fleas (tungiasis), causing discomfort, infection, and tissue destruction.
- • Spider bites are common in the Americas, Mediterranean, South Africa, and Australia but there are few fatalities.

- Only recluse spiders (*Loxosceles*) are reliably associated with necrotic araneism. Bites by cosmopolitan black and brown widow spiders (*Latrodectus*), Latin American banana spiders (*Phoneutria*), and Sydney funnel web spiders (*Atrax*) cause neurotoxic araneism.
- • Scorpion stings still cause numerous fatalities in North and South Africa, the Middle East, Mexico, Latin America, and India. Severe local pain and systemic autonomic effects may be fatal, especially in children.
- • Mass attacks by bees or vespids are uncommon, except during the Africanized killer bee epidemic in the Americas, during which many fatalities occurred.
- • Lepidopterism and erucism: stinging hairs of many species of moths and their larvae (caterpillars) can excite cutaneous irritation, allergy, and, in the case of caterpillars of the genus *Lonomia,* systemic envenoming.

# **138.1** Hypersensitization and Anaphylaxis Caused by Stings of Hymenopteran Insects

*David A. Warrell*

Insects whose stings commonly cause hypersensitization include members of the families Apidae (e.g., honey bees—*Apis mellifera, A. cerania, A. dorsata,* etc.—and bumble bees, *Bombus* spp.), Vespidae (e.g., European wasps [*Vespula germanica, V. vulgaris*], American wasps, yellow-jackets, and white-faced hornets [*Vespula* and *Dolichovespula* spp.], paper wasps [*Polistes* spp.], and European and Asian true hornets [*Vespa* spp.]), and Formicidae (e.g., American fire ants, genus *Solenopsis* [[Fig. 138.1.1](#page-1-0)], Australian bull or bulldog ants [*Myrmecia* spp.], and Asian needle ants [*Pachycondyla* spp.]).[1](#page-1-1) More than 80 venom allergens have been identified, including phospholipases A, hyaluronidase, acid phosphomonoesterases, and polypeptide neurotoxins, such as apamin and melittin (*A. mellifera*). Non-allergenic compounds include vasoactive amines such as histamine, 5-hydroxytryptamine, catecholamines and kinins, cholinesterase (in the venom of *V. germanica*), pheromones, 2-methylpiperidine alkaloids (in venoms of fire ants, *Solenopsis* spp.), and anti-inflammatory peptides such as peptide 401 (mast cell degranulating peptide) from honey bee venom.

#### **EPIDEMIOLOGY[2,3](#page-1-2)**

In most countries, insect stings are second only to drugs as causes of anaphylaxis. There are 40 to 50 deaths per year in the United States attributed to Hymenoptera sting anaphylaxis; in England and Wales, fewer than 5; and in Australia, 2 to 3. In children, the annual incidence of systemic reactions to stings by Hymenoptera has been reported to be 0.4% to 0.8% and in an adult population in the United States, the prevalence of systemic allergic sting reactions was found to be 4%, while 20 % of this population showed evidence of venom hypersensitivity by skin testing or radioallergosorbent testing (RAST). Two species of fire ants, *Solenopsis richteri* and *S. invicta,* were imported into the United States from South America in 1918 and have now spread to 13 southern states, where an estimated 2.5 million people are stung each month. The incidence of systemic allergic reactions is about 4 per 100,000 population per year, and there have been fatalities. In Tasmania and southern Australia, the jack jumper ant (*Myrmecia pilosula*) causes 90% of all ant stings. About 2% to 3% of the population are hypersensitive, and fatal anaphylaxis has occurred[.4](#page-1-3)

#### **PREVENTION**

Patients with a history of systemic anaphylaxis provoked by a sting and detectable venom-specific IgE should be considered for desensitization with purified venoms. This treatment proved significantly more effective than placebo or whole-body extracts of Hymenoptera in preventing anaphylactic reactions to sting challenge[.5,6](#page-1-4) Desensitization involves a series of visits to the clinic for administration of gradually increasing doses of venom followed by 5 years of maintenance therapy. Systemic reactions (anaphylaxis) occur in 5% to 15% of courses and local reactions in 50%.

Wasps are attracted by sweet things and meat in homes, greengrocers, orchards, and vineyards. At night, hornets are attracted by light. Some species, such as the Asian *Vespa mandarina,*

<span id="page-1-0"></span>are so aggressively territorial that their nests must be eradicated before the area can be farmed. Vespid nests may be destroyed by fumigation with insecticides. In aggressive bee colonies, the queens should be replaced.

Death from anaphylaxis can be prevented by self-administered first aid with epinephrine (adrenaline).

#### **CLINICAL FEATURE[S2,3,5](#page-1-2)**

Symptoms of anaphylaxis may start within minutes of the sting. They include itching, which may start in the scalp, palms, soles, axillae, and perineum and then become generalized; flushing; dizziness; syncope; wheezing; epigastric pain, abdominal colic (uterine colic in women), diarrhea, and incontinence of urine and feces; tachycardia; and visual disturbances—all developing within a few minutes of the sting. Urticaria; angioedema of the lips, gums, and tongue; generalized cutaneous erythema and swelling; edema of the glottis; profound hypotension; and coma may develop over the next 15 to 20 minutes. The median time to first cardiac arrest is 10 to 20 minutes after the sting, but deaths have occurred after only 2 minutes. A few patients develop serum sickness a week or more after the sting.

#### **DIAGNOSIS OF ANAPHYLAXIS AND VENOM HYPERSENSITIVITY**

Detection of a raised plasma/serum mast-cell tryptase or urine prostaglandin D2 and its metabolites (9α,11β-PGF2) confirms anaphylaxis, excluding panic attacks and other causes of collapse. The peak tryptase is 0.5 to 1.5 hours after the attack, but levels persist for 6 to 8 hours. Type I hypersensitivity is confirmed by detecting venom-specific (Vespidae, Apidae, Formicidae) IgE in the serum using RAST, prick skin tests, or basophil activation tests. Bumble bee and honey bee venoms cross-react, as do wasp, yellow jacket, and true hornet venoms. However, venoms of Apidae and Vespidae do not cross-react. Discrimination between primary sensitization and cross-reactivity is achieved with componentresolved diagnostics using panels of natural and recombinant venom allergens.

Patients who have suffered a systemic reaction have a 50% to 60% risk of a reaction to their next sting. In the absence of systemic symptoms, even massive and persistent local reactions do not predict a systemic reaction after subsequent stings. Children who have generalized urticaria after a sting have only a 10% chance of a systemic reaction when re-stung. Hypersensitivity to venom may be lost spontaneously in some children and young adults, but this is unpredictable. Live insect sting challenge is the only reliable method to assess response to immunotherapy. The RAST test can be used for a post-mortem diagnosis of Hymenoptera sting anaphylaxis.

#### **TREATMENT**

The barbed stings of Apidae remain embedded at the site of the sting and continue to inject venom, so they should be removed immediately by any possible means. Vespids can withdraw their stings, and sting repeatedly. Wasp stings may become infected because some species feed on rotting meat. Diluted domestic meat tenderizer (papain), ice packs, and aspirin relieve local pain in some cases. Systemic antihistamines can be used for more severe local reactions. Large local reactions may require treatment with antihistamines, non-steroidal anti-inflammatory agents, or even corticosteroids.

### **Treatment of Anaphylaxi[s7](#page-1-5)**

The patient should be placed in the recovery position and their airway protected. Elevation of the lower extremities is useful unless there is vomiting or airway compromise. Cardiopulmonary resuscitation may be needed. Epinephrine (adrenaline) should be given immediately by intramuscularinjection into the antero-lateralthigh: 0.1% (1:1000) (0.3–0.5 mg for adults; 0.01 mg/kg for children). Repeat every 5 to 15 minutes if no response or inadequate response. If the patient is unconscious or pulseless, epinephrine diluted 1:100,000 is given by slow intravenous (IV) push injection (50–100 µg, 0.5–1 mL). In rare cases, blood pressure fails to respond to even large doses of epinephrine and plasma expanders and requires pressor agents, such as norepinephrine. Use of IV histamine H1 blockers and corticosteroids is of unproven benefit but may prevent relapses. Rapid airway assessment, intubation for voice alteration, stridor, or respiratory arrest should be done, with emergency cricothyroidotomy if unsuccessful. People with known hypersensitivity should wear an identifying tag in case they are found unconscious after being stung. They should be trained to give themselves epinephrine using a self-injection device, but many of those who are prescribed injectors are unable to use them effectively because they have not been trained. Shock and airway obstruction are the main causes of death after insect sting anaphylaxis.

## **138.2** Bites by Other Insects Resulting in Irritation, Allergy, and Transmission of Infections[1](#page-2-0)

*David A. Warrell*

Blood-feeding insects such as mosquitoes, midges, black flies, sand flies, tabanid flies (horse, deer, and stable flies), tsetse flies, and triatomine "kissing" bugs carry out brief, blood-feeding attacks on humans and animals, which have a variety of medical consequences.

#### **CLINICAL FEATURES**

Bites by large aggressive flies (horse flies, gadflies, or cleggs [Tabanidae]) may be immediately painful and traumatic, but the most common problem is delayed local swelling and itching from sensitization by previous exposures to the insects' salivary allergens. A small, intensely itchy, reddish lump with a central (hemorrhagic) punctum develops immediately or after a delay of 24 to 48 hours. A papule, urticarial weal, blister, or bulla may develop (e.g., after "Blandford fly" *Simulium posticatum* bites in Oxfordshire, UK), or bites may provoke a more generalized erythema multiforme, or, especially in children, papular urticaria and sometimes even systemic anaphylaxis. Triatomine bug bites, some of which can transmit Chagas' disease, are usually multiple—often near the eye or angle of the mouth. They are painful, swollen, ooze blood, and may be surrounded by black staining from the bug's feces (see Chapter 103). Scratching may lead to secondary infection; an inflamed, painful pustule or carbuncle; or a demarcated, hot, bright red, raised area of erysipelas or cellulitis. The risk of secondary infection is greater in humid tropical conditions. Early symptoms, after minutes or a few hours, suggest envenoming or allergy; late symptoms after many hours or days suggest infection with causative bacteria, including *Staphylococcus aureus* and *Streptococcus pyogenes.*

Papular urticaria is a chronic or recurrent rash of numerous very itchy weals and papules with skin edema usually seen on the legs, buttocks, neck, and arms of young children. It erupts as weals with visible puncta and progresses to papules surmounted by vesicles or bullae that may become excoriated and infected. It is associated with chronic superficial infestations by fleas (e.g., cat fleas *Ctenocephalides felis*) and bedbugs (see later), and with bites by mosquitoes, mites, and other arthropods[.2,3](#page-2-1)

#### **SPECIFIC INFECTIONS TRANSMITTED BY BITING FLIES (DIPTERA) AND BUGS (HEMIPTERA)**

- • Mosquitoes (family Culicidae) transmit many viral infections, malaria, lymphatic filariasis, and myiasis.
- • Sandflies (subfamily Phlebotominae) transmit *Phlebovirus* (Pappataci) fever, Oroya fever (*Bartonella bacilliformis*), and leishmaniasis.
- • Tsetse flies(family Glossinidae)transmitAfrican trypanosomiasis.
- • *Chrysops* or deer flies (family Tabanidae) transmit *Loa loa.*
- • Black flies (family Simuliidae) transmit onchocerciasis.
- • Reduviid bugs (family Reduviidae) transmit American trypanosomiasis.
- • Giant water bugs (family Belastomatidae) may transmit Buruli ulcer.

#### **Treatment**

- • Apply a cooling antiseptic solution, cream, or ointment (e.g., triclosan, hydrogen peroxide, Savlon) to soothe irritation and prevent secondary infection.
- • Reduce itch with counter-irritants such as crotamiton (Eurax) cream/lotion with or without hydrocortisone.

- • Topical corticosteroids (e.g., hydrocortisone 0.5% cream or ointment) may help, but topical antihistamines are not recommended as they may be light-sensitizing.
- • For severe pruritus, use oral antihistamines. Try full-dose, non-sedating anti-H1 drugs such as cetirizine (adult dose up to 10 mg twice a day) during the day and chlorphenamine (Piriton) 4 mg at night.
- • Early systemic symptoms of anaphylaxis should be treated with adrenaline (epinephrine) 0.1% (1:1000) by intramuscular injection.
- • If inflamed pustules develop, apply a topical anti-bacterial such as mupirocin (Bactroban). They may need to be lanced under aseptic conditions. Multiple infected bites may warrant a course of oral antibiotic, such as flucloxacillin, erythromycin, trimethoprim– sulfamethoxazole, or clindamycin.

#### **Prevention**

Be prepared for insect bites, not only in tropical rainforests and beaches, but also in the arctic and in cool mountainous terrain such as the Californian Sierra Nevada, Italian Dolomites, and Scottish Highlands. The risk of bites varies geographically, seasonally, and diurnally. Seek specific advice.

- • Sensible clothing should be ample and protective. Long sleeves and long trousers should be worn after dusk. Light colors are less attractive to mosquitoes than dark ones. Blue color attracts African tsetse flies (see Chapter 102). Hats and face veils may be necessary to protect against mass attacks on the face and scalp by swarms of Scottish midges (*Culicoides*) or tropical blackflies (*Simulium*). This protection is recommended in places where there is a high risk of acquiring mucosal leishmaniasis by bites of tiny sand flies (*Phlebotomus, Lutzomyia*), for example, Manu National Park in Peru.
- • Effective repellents include diethyl-toluamide (DEET) and P-methane-diol. These can be applied to exposed skin or impregnated into cotton clothing and socks and ankle, wrist, and head bands.
- • Clothes can be impregnated with pyrethroid insecticides, but this may impair waterproofing.
- • Protect sleeping quarters. Night bites by mosquitoes that transmit malaria, cone-nosed (triatomine) "kissing" bugs (Central and South America) that transmit Chagas disease, sand flies that transmit leishmaniasis, bedbugs, soft ticks that transmit tick-borne encephalitis and tick-borne relapsing fever, and even vampire bats that transmit rabies (see Chapter 38.1), can be prevented by sleeping under a well-tucked-in pyrethroidimpregnated mosquito net. Mosquito-proofing of sleeping quarters and insecticide spraying at dusk reduces the risk. Pyrethroid-releasing mosquito coils can be burned or, if there is electricity, plug-in insecticide vaporizers can be used. Fans may deter mosquitoes from biting.
