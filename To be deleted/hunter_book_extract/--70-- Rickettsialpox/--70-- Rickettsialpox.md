*Christopher D. Paddock*

## KEY FEATURES

- • A mite-borne zoonosis caused by *Rickettsia akari* and transmitted to humans by the house mouse mite (*Liponyssoides sanguineus*).
- • Most cases originate in urban settings and are associated with house mouse (*Mus musculus*) infestations.
- • A mild to moderately severe spotted-fever rickettsiosis with a cosmopolitan distribution.
- • Clinical disease characterized by fever, one or more inoculation eschars, and a vesiculopustular rash.
- • Severe disease is uncommon, and there have been no known deaths.
- • Doxycycline is the therapy of choice.
- • Prevention usually involves anti-rodent measures and acaricides.

# **INTRODUCTION**

Rickettsialpox, a mite-borne and predominately urban zoonosis that cycles among house mice (*Mus musculus*) and house mouse mites (*Liponyssoides sanguineus*), was discovered by physicians in 1946 in the borough of Queens, New York City, United States. Investigators quickly isolated and described the causative agent, *Rickettsia akari* (from the Greek word for *mite*), from mice and mites. Confirmed or suspected cases of rickettsialpox have been reported from at least 14 countries around the world, making this disease one of the few spotted-fever-group rickettsioses with a cosmopolitan distribution.[1–4](#page-3-0)

## **EPIDEMIOLOGY**

Most documented cases of rickettsialpox describe patients who resided in New York City at the time of illness.[4–7](#page-3-1) The disease has been described occasionally from other large metropolitan centers of the eastern United States, including Hartford, Boston, Baltimore, Philadelphia, Cleveland, and Newark, as well as many other countries, including Ukraine, Croatia, Turkey, South Korea, Mexico, and the Netherlands [\(Fig. 70.1\)](#page-1-0). The disease likely occurs throughout many other regions of the world where *M. musculus* and *L. sanguineus* co-exist. Patients with antibodies reactive with *R. akari* have been described from Albania, Bosnia-Herzegovina, Costa Rica, Central African Republic, France, Germany, and South Africa, although it remains to be determined whether these reflect true infections with *R. akari* or exposures to other closely related *Rickettsia* species[.3,8–13](#page-3-2) Rickettsialpox occurs in patients of all ages, from infants as young as 6 months, to adults as old as 92 years. In most patient series, the disease occurs equally among males and females, and cases are documented from all months of the year. Cases of rickettsialpox often cluster in time and space, and simultaneous or consecutive illnesses are sometimes observed among family members or other residents from a single common location. In contrast with most other rickettsioses, the majority of cases of rickettsialpox are described from large urban centers, consistent with the important role of peridomestic rodents in the distribution and occurrence of *R. akari.*[1,3,8](#page-3-0)

# **NATURAL HISTORY, PATHOGENESIS, AND PATHOLOGY**

*R. akari* is transmitted among house mice and several species of rodents by *L. sanguineus.* Humans become infected with *R. akari* only when a mite infected with rickettsiae cannot locate its natural host and is forced to obtain a blood meal from a human. In that context, ecologic factors that govern populations of house mice and *L. sanguineus* largely influence the emergence of rickettsialpox in human populations. *R. akari* has been cultured from house mice and wild rodent species[,14,15](#page-3-3) as well as from the house mouse mite[.16,17](#page-3-4) Transovarial and trans-stadial transmission of rickettsiae occurs in *L. sanguineus* to implicate the mite as the most likely important reservoir host of *R. akari.*

*Liponyssoides sanguineus* ([Fig. 70.2\)](#page-1-1) is a minute (approximately 400–700 µm) ectoparasite, typically found in proximity to rodent harborages that include nests and burrows, and in cracks and crevices close to nesting sites[.18](#page-3-5) Nymphal stages and adult mites ingest blood and can transmit *R. akari* to a susceptible host. Because of its small size, this mite is almost never seen by patients. *L. sanguineus* has been collected from house mice and various rodent species in several states across the United States, as well as Egypt, Ukraine, Armenia, Turkmenistan, and Sicily[.3](#page-3-2) Despite broad geographic distributions of the vector mite and the house mouse, confirmed reports of rickettsialpox are relatively sparse and sporadic, suggesting that *R. akari* is distributed less ubiquitously than its principal vertebrate host or arthropod vector. The tropical rat mite (*Ornithonyssus bacoti*) can also serve as an efficient vector of *R. akari* under experimental conditions, and *R. akari* has been detected in trombiculid mites in South Korea, suggesting that other species of hematophagous mites could be involved in the natural history of this pathogen.[19,20](#page-3-6)

*R. akari* does not stain well with conventional Gram- or eosinazure–based methods but does stain with Giménez, Macchiavello's, and other related techniques that use carbol-basic fuchsin. *R. akari* can be detected microscopically in host tissues by using immunohistochemical stains. Using these techniques, the bacteria appear as small (approximately 0.3 µm × 1. 0 µm) rods and coccobacilli situated in the cytoplasm of cells in inflamed foci in the dermis. *R. akari* is found predominantly in macrophages in the perivascular and periadnexal inflammatory cell infiltrates of the cutaneous lesions and only rarely in vascular endothelial cells. The histopathology of the inoculation eschar demonstrates extensive necrosis of the epidermis and dermis, with subjacent perivascular and periadnexal inflammatory cell infiltrates and occasional panniculitis ([Fig. 70.3](#page-2-0)). The histopathology of the rash is typically more variable and age-dependent; however, fully developed papulovesicles show subepidermal vesicle formation that is a characteristic histopathologic feature of rickettsialpox. Inflamed blood vessels demonstrate varying degrees of endothelial swelling, blurring, or obliteration of the vessel wall by inflammatory cell infiltrates, mural necrosis, extravasation of red cells, or fibrin thrombi (see [Fig. 70.3](#page-2-0)). Lymphocytes and macrophages comprise the predominant inflammatory cell types, although neutrophils are occasionally present in and around necrotic foci[.21,22](#page-3-7)

## **CLINICAL FEATURES**

Estimated limits of the incubation period range from 6 to 15 days after the bite of an infected mite. The primary lesion, or inoculation

eschar, is seen in >90% of patients [\(Table 70.1\)](#page-2-1). In its early stages, it is a painless, non-pruritic, erythematous papule that subsequently enlarges and develops a central vesicle containing clear or opaque fluid. Eventually, the vesicle ruptures and a dark brown or black crust develops over the lesion, forming the characteristic eschar (see [Fig. 70.3\)](#page-2-0). The eschar is often surrounded by a larger zone of erythema. Primary lesions range in size from 0.5 to 2.5 cm and are most frequently observed on the extremities but may be found anywhere on the body. Two eschars can be identified occasionally on separate anatomic sites. The eschar generally persists for 3 to 4 weeks and may heal to form a small, depressed scar. A cutaneous eruption develops in most patients 1 to 4 days after the onset of fever. This eruption is characterized by small (2–10 mm), discrete, erythematous maculopapules distributed on the extremities, abdomen, back, chest, and face, and only rarely on the palms and soles. After 2 to 3 days, some lesions become indurated and develop a small vesicle containing cloudy fluid at the apex. The number of papules varies from 5 to more than 100, although most patients develop approximately 20 to 30 of these lesions. The rash is neither painful nor pruritic and generally resolves within 7 days to leave small, hyperpigmented spots. An enanthem occurs in approximately 20% to 25% of patients and is characterized by small (2–4 mm) vesicles, maculopapules, or erosions on the oral mucosae[.2,5–7,23,24](#page-3-9)

Patients with rickettsialpox typically develop fever, diaphoresis, lassitude, myalgia, and headache within 2 to 7 days after the appearance of the eschar. In patients who do not receive specific antibiotic therapy, these symptoms can persist for 7 to 10 days. The peak temperature is 38° to 40°C, although it may rise to 41°C. A headache, usually frontal and occasionally severe, occurs in approximately 90% to 100% of patients. Myalgia is common and is most often described as backache. Less frequently reported findings include conjunctivitis, splenomegaly, pharyngitis, nausea, and vomiting. Routine laboratory abnormalities often include mild leukopenia with a relative lymphocytosis and mildly elevated levels of aspartate and alanine aminotransferases. Rickettsialpox is a self-limited illness, and in most case series, patients are hospitalized infrequently. Moderate-to-severe manifestations are reported rarely and include hepatitis, photophobia, and nuchal rigidity. No deaths have been attributed to infection with *R. akari*.

# **PATIENT EVALUATION, DIAGNOSIS, AND DIFFERENTIAL DIAGNOSIS**

Other rickettsial diseases, particularly those associated commonly with an eschar or a papulovesicular exanthem, can closely resemble rickettsialpox. These include African tick-bite fever (caused by *R. africae*), *R. parkeri* rickettsiosis, Queensland tick typhus (caused by *R. australis*), and scrub typhus (caused by *Orientia tsutsugamushi*) (see [Table 70.1](#page-2-1)). Other infectious conditions with one or more clinical similarities include chickenpox and other herpetic dermatitides,

cutaneous leishmaniasis, tularemia, melioidosis, and cutaneous anthrax. A carefully obtained patient history that includes questions about location of residence and work, and sightings of house mice in these settings, can provide additional diagnostic clues.

Laboratory confirmation of rickettsialpox is most often achieved by serology, and the indirect immunofluorescence antibody (IFA) assay is the reference standard for serologic procedures. Most commercially available IFA assays use *Rickettsia rickettsii* (the agent of Rocky Mountain spotted fever) as a surrogate antigen for *R. akari* because of high serologic cross-reactivity among rickettsiae of the spotted-fever group. Confirmation requires a fourfold or greater rise in immunoglobulin G antibody titer in appropriately paired specimens. Ideally, the first specimen is obtained during the first week of illness and the second is collected 2 to 4 weeks after complete clinical recovery. Anti-rickettsial antibodies are absent in most infected patients during the first week of the illness, and results based on a single serum sample collected when the patient first presents for care are generally non-diagnostic. It is also important to recognize that antibody titers to spotted-fevergroup *Rickettsia* species are only group specific and IFA tests cannot be used to establish a species-specific diagnosis. When possible, more elaborate techniques, such as cross-adsorption or Western blotting, can be used to corroborate the diagnosis; however, these assays are generally restricted to specialized research laboratories and reference centers[.12,13](#page-3-11) Most patients with rickettsialpox do not develop agglutinating antibodies against the OX-19, OX-2, and OX-K antigens of *Proteus vulgaris* (i.e., negative Weil–Felix reactions). A negative Weil–Felix test is considered a relatively consistent serologic feature of rickettsialpox but provides only presumptive evidence of the disease in the appropriate clinical context.

Because rickettsiae and rickettsial antigens are typically distributed in great abundance in the inoculation eschar[,26,27](#page-3-12) polymerase chain reaction amplification of rickettsial nucleic acids from swab or tissue biopsy samples of this lesion represent the most sensitive and specific method of confirming rickettsialpox. Nonetheless, the reference standard for microbiological confirmation of rickettsialpox is cultivation of *R. akari* in cell culture. A punch biopsy specimen obtained from the central aspect of the lesion provides the ideal specimen to inoculate cell cultures for attempted isolation of *R. akari*. [22](#page-3-13) *R. akari* will grow in several standard cell lines, including Vero E6 and L929 cells. In this context, Biosafety Level

## **TREATMENT**

Tetracyclines, particularly doxycycline, remain the drugs of choice for the treatment of rickettsialpox. In two contemporary case series documenting antibiotic responses in 28 patients who received tetracycline or doxycycline treatment for rickettsialpox, fever and other systemic symptoms resolved in most patients within 24 hours and all patients became asymptomatic within 48 hours.[6,7](#page-3-14) The standard oral dose of doxycycline is 100 mg every 12 hours, continued for at least 3 days after complete resolution of fever, with a minimum treatment course of 5 days. Despite concerns regarding tooth staining and enamel hypoplasia after use of tetracycline-class antibiotics in children younger than 8 years of age, recent studies indicate that a short (e.g., 5 days) course of therapy with doxycycline does not cause tooth staining or enamel hypoplasia in the permanent teeth of children who receive this antibiotic before the age of 8 years.[28](#page-3-15) Chloramphenicol, given at a dosage of 12.5 mg/kg every 6 hours for 5 to 10 days, can be used as alternate therapy in those patients for whom there is an absolute contraindication for receiving doxycycline; nonetheless, chloramphenicol is no longer available in the oral form in the United States, and the intravenous form is not readily available at all institutions.[29](#page-3-16) Most *Rickettsia* species, including *R. akari,* are highly susceptible to rifampin in vitro,[30](#page-3-17) and this antibiotic has been used rarely, albeit successfully, to treat some rickettsial infections in patients with doxycycline intolerance, at a dose of 450 mg twice a day for 10 days.[31](#page-3-18) However, there are no clinical data describing the efficacy of rifampin in patients with rickettsialpox, and this antibiotic should be considered an alternative to doxycycline only for specialized situations.

# **PREVENTION AND CONTROL**

There is no vaccine against rickettsialpox. Prevention depends principally on effective control of house mice in human dwellings and workplaces. Thorough vacuuming and dusting with diatomaceous earth of mite-infested areas can eliminate some mites; however, rodent elimination should always be coupled with acaricide treatments to mouse nests and runways, as well as walls and ceilings of infested premises.[32](#page-3-8) There are no data regarding sensitivity of *L. sanguineus* to contemporary acaricides; nonetheless, pyrethrin and pyrethroid sprays and dusts are used effectively against other related and commonly encountered parasitic mite species[.33](#page-4-6)
