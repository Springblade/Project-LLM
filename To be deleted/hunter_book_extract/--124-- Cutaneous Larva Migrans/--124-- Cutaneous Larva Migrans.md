# **124** Cutaneous Larva Migrans

*Susan P. Montgomery*

## KEY FEATURES

- • Cutaneous larva migrans (CLM) is a creeping eruption caused by the migration of larval nematodes in the epidermis. Most infections are associated with *Ancylostoma braziliense,* a hookworm of both dogs and cats.
- • Diagnosis is made clinically; serologic testing is not widely available.
- • Symptoms and signs are one or more erythematous, serpiginous tracks in the epidermis; pruritus; erythema; and mild swelling. Allergic reactions and folliculitis can occur.
- • CLM is often associated with travel to tropical or near-tropical areas where environmental conditions favor larval development.
- • CLM can be prevented by avoiding contact with potentially contaminated soil or sand.
- • Although infection with zoonotic hookworm larvae is self-limiting, treatment with albendazole or ivermectin can shorten the duration of clinical disease.

#### **INTRODUCTION**

Cutaneous larva migrans (CLM) is a dermatologic condition known as *creeping eruption,* and is caused by the migration of animal nematode larvae, most commonly the larvae of the dog and cat hookworm *Ancylostoma braziliense.* It was first reported to be associated with *A. braziliense* larvae by Kirby-Smith et al. in 1926[.1](#page-1-0) Other common dog and cat hookworms, *A. caninum, A. ceylanicum,* and *Uncinaria stenocephala,* have been associated with disease[.2](#page-1-1)

CLM is most often reported in returning travelers who have had soil and/or sand exposures in regions where *A. braziliense* is endemic in resident dog and cat populations[.2,3](#page-1-1) The global burden of disease remains undefined.[4](#page-1-2)

#### **EPIDEMIOLOGY**

Dog and cat hookworms occur throughout the world, although hookworm species have differing geographic ranges ([Table 124.1](#page-1-3)). *A. braziliense* is found in warmer climates along the Atlantic but not Pacific coasts of the Americas, from the southeastern United States, throughout the Caribbean, and into South America. From animal studies, *A. braziliense* has also been reported in parts of Africa, Australia, and Southeast Asia. *A. caninum* is found wherever dogs are present in warmer climates; *U. stenocephala* is restricted to colder climates.[2](#page-1-1)

CLM is most frequently reported among travelers to tropical or near-tropical parts of the world; traveler infections likely represent only a small proportion of the global burden of disease. Infection is associated with unprotected skin exposure among tourists and younger age groups in areas where dogs and cats are free-ranging and have high rates of hookworm infection and where soil and sand contamination is widespread.[3–6](#page-1-4) In a survey of a rural population in Brazil, the prevalence of CLM during the rainy season was 14.9% among children younger than 5 years old and 0.7% among adults aged 20 years and older.[7](#page-2-0) However, the prevalence in resident populations is poorly defined, as CLM is not considered a public health priority.

Lesions of CLM are located on the body area in contact with soil, especially the feet, buttocks, and thighs. Rarely, infection has been linked to exposure to contaminated clothing or plant material[.2,6](#page-1-1)

#### **NATURAL HISTORY, PATHOGENESIS, AND PATHOLOGY**

Hookworm eggs are shed in the feces of the animal host and develop into infective filariform larvae in the soil, where they can survive for several weeks under appropriate environmental conditions. When human skin comes in contact with contaminated soil or sand, larvae attempt to penetrate the skin, but the larvae of most species of animal hookworm cannot penetrate beyond the dermis[.2](#page-1-1) The larvae of *A. braziliense* will migrate in the epidermis for several weeks before dying, after which lesions resolve spontaneously. *A. caninum* and *A. ceylanicum* larvae can penetrate more deeply and have been associated with other clinical syndromes, including eosinophilic enteritis. Rarely, eosinophilic pneumonitis has been reported in patients with CLM, possibly due to larval penetration involving the lungs. Allergic reactions can occur in multiply exposed individuals with extreme inflammatory response at the location of the track.[2,6,8](#page-1-1)

#### **CLINICAL FEATURES**

Signs and symptoms appear shortly after the larvae penetrate the skin, typically within a few days of infection, although delay of onset for up to several months has been reported. The median time to onset of CLM has ranged from 10 to 15 days[.6,8](#page-2-1) The first symptom is typically intense pruritus followed by a raised, erythematous track that starts near the site of penetration. A stinging sensation at the time of larval penetration has been reported. Tracks, typically about 3 mm wide and up to 20 mm long, can move at a rate of several millimeters per day; the larva itself is usually migrating somewhere ahead of the track. Usually, there are only one or a few tracks, but multiple tracks can occur in more intense infections [\(Fig. 124.1\)](#page-1-5). Vesiculobullous lesions and edema can accompany the track; folliculitis is uncommon and may be related to the infecting species of hookworm. Eosinophilia is not consistently present and is likely when larvae have penetrated to deeper tissues or a greater inflammatory reaction is present[.6,8](#page-2-1)

## **PATIENT EVALUATION, DIAGNOSIS, AND DIFFERENTIAL DIAGNOSIS**

CLM is a clinical diagnosis based on the presence of characteristic pruritus and an erythematous raised track that moves randomly in the dermis, as well as a history of skin exposure to contaminated soil or sand in endemic areas. Serologic testing to confirm infection is not available; skin biopsy is not useful because the location of the migrating larva cannot be predicted by the visible track. Clinical features and travel history can also help to define differential diagnoses, including other parasitic infections such as human hookworm, gnathostomiasis, strongyloidiasis, dirofilariasis, or

#### **TREATMENT**

CLM can be prevented by wearing shoes, sitting or lying on protective mats while at the beach, and taking other protective measures to avoid skin contact with contaminated soil or sand. Regular deworming of cats and dogs and prompt disposal of animal waste help to control sources of infective larvae[.2](#page-1-1) CLM is self-limiting; larvae migrating in the skin usually will die after 5 to 6 weeks, although persistent clinical disease has been reported.

Treatment using cryotherapy is not recommended, because the larvae migrate randomly in advance of the visible tracks and may not be in the treated area. Topical therapy with anti-helminthics has been shown to be effective but needs repeated applications over large areas of skin. Oral albendazole (400 mg/day for 3–7 days) or ivermectin (200 µg/kg single dose) eliminates the symptoms and kills the migrating larvae; in more severe cases of folliculitis, additional doses may be necessary. Rarely, relapse can occur but usually is resolved by repeated treatment[.6,8,10,11](#page-2-1)

In children over 15 kg, a single dose of ivermectin 200 µg/kg orally is effective. Children under the age of 2 years should receive albendazole 200 mg orally for 3 days. Topical preparations of either drug have been suggested as alternative treatments in children.
