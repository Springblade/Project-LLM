# **160** Delusional Infestation (Delusional Parasitosis)

*Kathryn N. Suh, Jay S. Keystone*

### KEY FEATURES

- • An uncommon, unfounded, irrational belief of infestation that cannot be corrected by reasoning, persuasion, or logic.
- • More common in women and in older age groups (>50 years).
- • Patients may be otherwise highly functional.
- • Rarely, may be associated with underlying medical or psychiatric disease, substance abuse, or medications.
- • Long-standing history of cutaneous complaints and dermatologic findings, often for months to years before diagnosis.
- • Skin lesions are common and often asymmetric, reflecting the range of the dominant upper limb.
- • Effective therapies (neuroleptics) are available but often difficult for patients to accept.
- • Synonyms: delusions of infestation; delusions of (or delusional) parasitosis.
  - • Less commonly*:* chronic tactile hallucinosis, cocaine bugs, delusional ectoparasitosis, delusory parasitosis, Ekbom's syndrome, formication, praeseniler dermatozoenwahn (presenile dermatozoic delusion), psychogenic parasitosis.
  - • Others*:* acaraphobia, dermatophobia, entomophobia, parasitophobia (technically these are not correct because they indicate a phobia rather than belief).

#### **INTRODUCTION**

Delusional infestation (DI) (delusional parasitosis), first described in 1894, is a disorder in which affected individuals have a delusion an unshakeable belief—that they are infected by "bugs": parasites, worms, bacteria, mites, or other living organisms, associated with abnormal cutaneous sensations. Although the disease remains relatively rare, there is increasing awareness of and advancement in the pharmacologic therapy of DI. However, recognition and management of this problem continue to be challenging.

#### **EPIDEMIOLOGY**

Delusional disorders are rare, being slightly more common among women. Their incidence and prevalence were previously estimated to be 0.7 to 3.0 and 24 to 30 cases per 100,000 population, respectively[.1](#page-4-0) More recent data suggest that these may be underestimates; in one Swedish cohort, the lifetime prevalence of delusional disorders was estimated at 3 per 1000 population[.2](#page-4-1) In the United States the prevalence of delusional disorders is estimated to be 0.02%.[3](#page-4-2)

Rates of DI are difficult to determine. Because patients with DI generally refuse psychiatric help, the true incidence and prevalence of this disorder may be greatly underestimated in the psychiatric literature. In southwest Germany, the incidence and prevalence of DI were estimated to be 16.6 and 83.2 cases per million population per year, respectively, in a study published in 1991[.4](#page-4-3) In his 1995 review, Trabert[5](#page-4-4) had identified a total of 1223 cases in the literature; as of 2008, reports of over 1400 cases were published[.6](#page-4-5) A population-based study among residents of Olmsted County, Minnesota, between 1976 and 2010 found an incidence of DI of 1.9 cases (95% CI, 1.5–2.4) per 100,000 person-years, with an increasing incidence during each decade of the study[.7](#page-4-6) Most cases have been reported from North America and Europe, and more recently from most other areas of the world.

Although DI affects adults of all ages, it is much more common in older age groups (>50 years). In Trabert's review, the mean age of onset was 57 years and 84% of patients were over age 50, with men presenting at a slightly younger age than women.[5](#page-4-4) In Olmstead County, the mean age of onset was 61.4 years, 64% of cases were in women, and 70% were 40 years of age or older.[7](#page-4-6) Overall, women outnumber men by a ≈2 to 3:1 ratio[.5,7,8](#page-4-4) Although the sex distribution is almost equal in early adulthood, the female:male ratio exceeds 2:1 in individuals over 50 years of age[.5,7,8](#page-4-4)

Patients can be from any socioeconomic background. Many are single and may be considered "loners." A higher-than-expected prevalence of personality disorders has been observed in some case series.[8,9](#page-4-7) However, many affected individuals are both educated and highly functional; in Lyell's survey,[8](#page-4-7) several of the 282 patients described were professionals, including physicians and psychologists.

### **NATURAL HISTORY, PATHOGENESIS, AND PATHOLOGY**

In its truest form, DI is a delusional disorder of the somatic type, in which the theme of the delusion "involves bodily functions or sensations.["3](#page-4-2) Munro[10](#page-4-8) first suggested that DI was a form of monosymptomatic hypochondriasis or monosymptomatic hypochondriacal psychosis (MHP), a fixed, single hypochondriacal belief that exists when no other thought disorder is present. Delusions of parasitosis are the most common form of MHP.

The pathophysiology of somatic delusional disorders is unknown. Some have theorized that abnormal sensations experienced by patients (*as if* something was crawling on the skin) lead to the conviction that parasites are present (that something really *is* crawling on the skin). An incident during which exposure to parasites might have occurred, such as sleeping in unclean bedsheets, borrowing another's clothing, or travel to an exotic destination, may be a trigger for DI[.11](#page-4-9) In some, newly acquired knowledge or awareness of a disease (through heightened public health or media interest or the Internet, for example) can amplify and perpetuate new or pre-existing symptoms; reasons for this symptom amplification are unclear. Stress can also exacerbate somatic complaints, and the stress induced by the severity of the perceived illness may augment symptoms further.

It has also been suggested that DI may be due to central nervous system abnormalities. Response of many patients to the dopamine antagonist pimozide supports the theory that DI results from excess extracellular dopamine within the striatum of the brain[.12](#page-4-10) In some patients, structural abnormalities in the basal ganglia, in particular the putamen and caudate nucleus, have been documented[13,14](#page-4-11); most of these patients also responded favorably to dopamine antagonists. Such findings must be interpreted with caution, however, given the small number of patients studied and the lack of comparison with age-matched normal controls.

#### **CLASSIFICATION OF DELUSIONAL INFESTATION**

No definite classification of DI exists. Broadly speaking, three different forms can be described.

#### **Primary Delusional Infestation**

Primary DI is a somatic delusional disorder [\(Box 160.1](#page-1-0)). Patients with delusional disorders do not meet the diagnostic criteria for schizophrenia or other psychiatric disorders. Specifically, hallucinations, disorganized speech, schizophrenic behavior, and other "negative" symptoms are absent,[3](#page-4-2) although hallucinations that are *secondary* to the delusional theme (i.e., tactile hallucinations) may be present. Similarly, anxiety or depression *secondary* to the delusional disorder may be present.

# **Secondary Delusional Infestation: Associated With Underlying Psychiatric Disease**

Delusions of parasitosis may be a manifestation of an underlying psychiatric illness, such as schizophrenia, anxiety, depression, obsessive-compulsive disorder, schizophreniform disorder, bipolar disorder, or post-traumatic stress disorder. It is essential to distinguish this form of DI from primary DI, as the management differs, but this may be challenging, particularly for the non-psychiatrist physician who is most likely to encounter such patients.

#### <span id="page-1-0"></span>**BOX 160.1** Diagnostic Criteria for Delusional Disorder

- 1. The presence of one or more delusions with a duration of 1 month or longer.
- 2. Criterion A for schizophrenia has never been met.
  - • **Note:** Hallucinations, if present, are not prominent and are related to the delusional theme (e.g., the sensation of being infested with insects associated with delusions of infestation).
- 3. Apart from the impact of the delusion(s) or its ramifications, functioning is not markedly impaired, and behavior is not obviously bizarre or odd.
- 4. If manic or major depressive episodes have occurred, these have been brief relative to the duration of the delusional periods.
- 5. The disturbance is not attributable to the physiological effects of a substance or another medical condition and is not better explained by another mental disorder, such as body dysmorphic disorder or obsessive-compulsive disorder.

Also verbatim, here are the criteria (criterion A, no. 2, given earlier) for schizophrenia:

- 1. Two or more of the following, each present for a significant portion of time during a 1-month period (or less if successfully treated). At least one of these must be (1), (2), or (3):
  - 1. Delusions
  - 2. Hallucinations
  - 3. Disorganized speech (e.g., frequent derailment or incoherence)
  - 4. Grossly disorganized or catatonic behavior
  - 5. Negative symptoms (i.e., diminished emotional expression or avolition)

### **Secondary Delusional Infestation: Associated With Underlying Medical Conditions**

Although up to 25% of cases of DI have been attributed to underlying medical conditions,[5,9](#page-4-4) in our experience this is remarkably rare. DI has been attributed to diseases of most organ systems, most commonly the central nervous system [\(Table 160.1](#page-1-1)). Substance abuse should be considered, especially when DI presents in younger age groups. Numerous prescription medications have been implicated in DI; in such cases, symptoms generally resolve once the offending drug is discontinued. Documented parasitic infection rarely (2% of cases) precedes the development of DI.[8](#page-4-7)

#### **MORGELLONS**

Morgellons, a syndrome dating back to the 16th century, is characterized by the patient's beliefs that inanimate objects (such as colored strings or fibers) are present in the skin or being extruded from it.[15,16](#page-4-12) The etiology of Morgellons is as yet unconfirmed. Recently a single group of investigators published several studies from a small number of patients with Morgellons that described histologic and electron microscopic findings of skin samples that included the presence of spirochetes; they proposed that the condition may be related to *Borrelia burgdorferi* infection[.17,18](#page-4-13) However, these findings were contrary to an

earlier, larger study of 115 patients with unexplained dermopathy (Morgellons) conducted by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. The authors of this study reported the absence of parasites, concluding that the condition was similar to delusional infestation[.19](#page-4-14)

#### **CLINICAL FEATURES**

Patients with DI have unfounded, fixed irrational beliefs of infestation that cannot be corrected by reasoning, persuasion, or logic. Symptoms and beliefs are variable, ranging from a non-disruptive feeling of infestation to delusions that may interfere with daily activities. Patients with primary DI generally have intact mental function, lack other manifestations of psychiatric disease, and have otherwise normal behavior. Their delusions are limited in scope and usually do not interfere with personal and professional aspects of their lives. Patients with secondary DI may have signs and symptoms of underlying disease. Younger patients are more likely to have DI associated with head injuries, substance abuse, and schizophrenia and are more likely to be involved in shared delusions[.8,20](#page-4-7) Delusions due to substance abuse are usually transient and of inadequate duration to meet the criteria for delusional disorder.

Long-standing dermatologic complaints are common, including rashes; pruritus; and sensations of stinging, biting, and formication. Most patients have chronic symptoms, at least 6 months in duration and often longer, before the diagnosis is established. The median and average duration of symptoms before diagnosis in Trabert's study was 1 year and 3 years, respectively.[5](#page-4-4) Patients may have received repeated courses of dermatologic and anti-parasitic therapies despite the lack of an objective diagnosis. They frequently bring in specimens for examination, which they have picked from their skin—the "matchbox" or "Ziploc bag" sig[n21,22—](#page-4-15)and which typically contain normal skin flakes or dust, hair, or occasionally parts of non-pathogenic insects. Patients may produce bizarre and exhaustive descriptions and diagrams of the parasites and their reproductive cycles. Patients who attribute their disease to household pets may have visited veterinarians repeatedly, seeking treatment for their pets. Consultation with pest-control services and exterminators and use of potentially toxic pesticides (on themselves and their belongings) may be attempted. Those driven to extremes may move or rid themselves of their belongings. For some, fear of transmission of their "infection" to others may cause them to be socially isolated, even from family members. More recently, as a result of Internet searches, some believe that they have "Morgellons disease."

Others, particularly family members, may occasionally be drawn into the patient's delusional system, usually by a woman[.23](#page-4-16) Between 8% and 25% of delusions of parasitosis are shared,[8,9,23](#page-4-7) most often with one other person (folie á deux), usually a partner or spouse (less commonly offspring). On occasion, trios (folie á trois), or even larger groups, may be involved.

# **PATIENT EVALUATION, DIAGNOSIS, AND DIFFERENTIAL DIAGNOSIS**

DI should be suspected when an individual presents with an irrational, fixed belief that he or she is infected with internal or external parasites in spite of reassurance and ample evidence to the contrary. It is important to determine the following: (1) Is the belief founded in reality and the patient is truly infected? (2) If infection can be excluded, is the patient truly delusional, or is the patient hypochondriacal and the belief "shakable"? and (3) If the patient is delusional, what form of DI is present? The optimal therapy differs depending on the answers to these questions. If an organic cause can be ruled out, the major challenge is then to determine whether the patient is suffering from a primary delusional disorder or has an underlying psychiatric illness. A psychiatric opinion is invaluable in such instances, but most patients with DI will refuse a psychiatric assessment.

The initial assessment(s) should focus on the patient's primary complaints, eliminating both true infection and an organic disease(s) as causes of their symptoms. A thorough history to elicit symptoms of underlying disease, and use of prescription and illicit drugs, should be obtained; important clues about underlying medical or psychiatric illness can be discovered by thorough, careful questioning and listening. A complete physical examination is essential, looking for findings of underlying conditions and paying particular attention to the skin, because most patients have cutaneous symptoms. Ulcers, scratches, denuded skin, and scars may be present from attempts to remove the organisms from the skin by using fingernails, knives, pins, duct tape, or other objects. Lesions are often absent in the upper back where the patient cannot reach. Contact or irritant dermatitis may be present from excessive cleaning or the use of abrasive soaps or chemicals.

Evaluation by a dermatologist can be beneficial and may reassure the patient that his or her symptoms are being taken seriously. If the patient has brought his or her own specimens, reassure the patient that these will be sent to a proper laboratory and/or entomologist for examination. The patient should be provided with specimen bottles containing preservative to collect additional specimens, thereby reducing the chance that parasites will be missed because of improper collection and reassuring the patient that you "believe" him or her. Skin biopsies are rarely required. Negative results, especially from repeated examinations of submitted specimens, can eliminate the possibility of a real parasitic infection. Appropriate initial investigations should be obtained [\(Box 160.2](#page-2-0)).

Follow-up visits fulfill multiple needs. In addition to providing more opportunity for the patient to develop trust in the physician, serial examination of skin lesions during repeat visits can be performed and additional specimens (or other investigations) obtained as required. Repeated assessments may also be helpful in determining whether the patient has a shakable belief (hypochondriasis) rather than true delusions, if this remains unclear. Because most patients will not agree to psychiatric care, long-term follow-up will be with the primary care physician.

#### **Psychiatric Assessment**

Secondary DI associated with underlying psychiatric disorders is best managed by a psychiatrist. Some suggest that most

<span id="page-2-0"></span>**BOX 160.2** Suggested Initial Investigations in Patients With Delusional Infestation

In all patients:

- • Complete blood count and differential
- • Electrolytes, urea, creatinine
- • Liver function tests and enzymes
- • Fasting blood sugar
- • Thyroid-stimulating hormone level
- • B12 and folate levels
- • Calcium and magnesium
- • Erythrocyte sedimentation rate and C-reactive protein
- • Chest radiograph

Based on the individual's risk factors and symptoms:

- • Drug and toxin screen
- • Serology for HIV infection and syphilis
- • Tuberculin skin test
- • Additional radiologic imaging (e.g., computerized tomography or magnetic resonance imaging of the brain)

patients with DI should be managed by primary care physicians, dermatologists, or infectious/tropical disease consultants for fear of losing them from medical care altogether by suggesting they see a psychiatrist, whereas others recommend that a psychiatrist be at least consulted at some point in the patient's care. However, many health care practitioners are not trained or prepared to provide the pharmacotherapy that can benefit the patient with DI.

Convincing patients with DI of the need for and importance of a psychiatric referral is extremely difficult. The treating physician's credibility often dissipates, and trust is lost at the mere mention of the need for psychiatric consultation or therapy; there is a significant risk of losing the patient altogether. Gradual introduction of the topic over the course of several visits, emphasizing the need for expert guidance to *manage the effects that DI has had on the patient's life* (such as stress or depression) may result in greater success. In some situations it may be helpful to discuss the case with a psychiatrist before commencing therapy.

#### **TREATMENT**

Psychotherapy, psychosurgery, and electroconvulsive therapy have met with little success in the treatment of DI, with low cure rates comparable to the rate of spontaneous resolution.[24](#page-4-17) Anti-depressant and anxiolytic medications may improve secondary mood disorders but generally have no role in the treatment of primary DI. In those with secondary DI, treatment of depression may resolve the delusional beliefs.[25](#page-4-18)

A strong therapeutic relationship with the patient is critical. A sympathetic, non-judgmental approach, acknowledgment that the patients' symptoms are real, and empathetic exploration into the effects their symptoms have had on their daily lives can instill a sense of trust into the relationship. A conservative, nonconfrontational approach is recommended[.24,26,27](#page-4-17) Use of phrases such as "I cannot see any parasites today" rather than "There are no parasites,"[8](#page-4-7) and acknowledgment that their problem *may* have resulted from a previous infection may accomplish this, while further gaining the patient's trust. It is important not to dismiss patients' complaints as trivial, even when they are clearly delusional, but equally important not to openly support their beliefs and feed into their delusional system. Reassurance that they can be helped is also valuable.

In spite of the limited evidence of their efficacy, with few clinical trials and no substantial randomized controlled trials conducted, anti-psychotic medications have become the mainstay of therapy for DI.[28](#page-4-19) The goal of therapy should be improvement in the patient's symptoms and not necessarily cure. Convincing patients to take anti-psychotic agents poses another significant obstacle, however. Even if patients do agree to start medication, adherence may be an issue. How does one convince psychotic patients who steadfastly believe that they are not psychotic to take anti-psychotics? One strategy that we have used with considerable success is the approach that *"the parasitic infection" is no longer present, but symptoms continue as a result of a "biochemical imbalance" resulting from the initial infestation.* Introducing the need for an anti-psychotic is accomplished by indicating that although the drug was originally designed for schizophrenia (*"but of course, you are not schizophrenic"*), it is being used for another purpose, that is, to rebalance body chemistry. This statement should be followed by examples of other medications that have more than one use, such as aspirin for pyrexia and coronary artery disease, or amitriptyline for depression and neuritis. Patients are much more likely to agree to take medication for treatment of a "chemical imbalance" than for a psychiatric problem. Some patients may be persuaded if they are told that patients with a similar condition have experienced great relief in their symptoms using similar medications. Bargaining with a patient is fraught with potential problems; however, the physician may agree to a patient's request (for example, treatment with an anti-parasitic agent) on the condition that the patient also begins an anti-psychotic medication, or that the anti-parasitic drug can only be given in a limited supply. The placebo effect of the drug has the potential to put the physician in a difficult position if the patient's symptoms improve but do not resolve with the therapy.

Efficacy comparisons of different agents are hindered by publication bias, the paucity of controlled trials, the inclusion of patients with both primary and secondary DI in many studies, and the lack of standardized criteria for assessing response to therapy.

#### **First-Generation Anti-Psychotic Agents**

Although many first-generation anti-psychotics have been used successfully for treatment of DI, pimozide has been the most extensively studied, with a high success rate. Case series from the late 1990s reported response rates of up to 87% (33%–52% complete, 28%–35% partial),[29,30](#page-4-20) and two small double-blind trials both demonstrated efficacy of greater than 90%[.31,32](#page-4-21) However, compared with second-generation anti-psychotics (SGAs), pimozide is associated with a higher rate of extrapyramidal disorders.

Pimozide selectively blocks dopamine type-2 receptors. It has minimal effect on other central nervous system neurotransmitters, although its antagonistic effects on opiate receptors may also reduce sensations of pruritus and formication.[31](#page-4-21) The most common adverse effects are extrapyramidal reactions (tremor, bradykinesia, shuffling gait), which occur in up to 15% of patients.[20](#page-4-22)

Doses between 1 and 12 mg daily are usually effective for treatment of DI. An initial dose of 0.5 to 1 mg daily can be increased gradually (e.g., by 1 mg weekly) either to the maximum daily dose of 20 mg or until the desired clinical effect has been achieved, which may take several weeks. Most patients respond to doses under 8 mg. Once a satisfactory response has been obtained, the patient should be maintained on the same dose for several months, and the dose can then be tapered gradually (by 1 mg every 1–2 weeks) until the drug is discontinued.[20,33](#page-4-22) If relapses occur, they often respond to re-institution of the drug. Many patients will require prolonged or indefinite therapy in order to control their symptoms.

#### **Second-Generation Anti-Psychotic Agents**

Many psychiatrists today would choose a newer atypical antipsychotic over pimozide, particularly in the elderly and those with known cardiac disease, because of the better safety profile, greater tolerability, and more specific actions. In a recent retrospective case series of patients with primary and secondary DI treated with various SGAs, partial or full remission was achieved in 37% and 38% of 63 cases, respectively, and overall, SGAs were felt to be as effective as traditional first-generation drugs, albeit with a lower rate of complete remission.[34](#page-4-23)

Risperidone is considered by some to be the first-line therapy for DI. Risperidone has been effective for some patients who have failed therapy with pimozide[.34,35](#page-4-23) Risperidone preferentially blocks serotonin receptors while still maintaining some activity against dopamine receptors. Between 0.25 and 8 mg daily, administered in one or two doses, is required for clinical response, although most patients require 2 to 4 mg[.34](#page-4-23) Adverse effects, including extrapyramidal reactions, can occur. A possible increased risk of cerebrovascular accidents in dementia patients receiving risperidone[36](#page-4-24) has not been reported in patients with delusional disorders. More recently, SGAs have been described in case reports and case series as effectively treating DI, including (in alphabetical order) aripiprazole[,37](#page-4-25) olanzapine[,38](#page-4-26) paliperidone[,39](#page-4-27) quetiapine[,40](#page-4-28) sertindole,[41](#page-4-29) and ziprasidone[.42](#page-4-30)

#### **OUTCOME AND PROGNOSIS**

DI was previously considered a progressive disorder with only a 10% to 30% chance of spontaneous remission.[13,24](#page-4-11) Anti-psychotic therapy has resulted in markedly improved outcomes.

Prognostic factors include the type of DI (primary versus secondary), duration of illness before therapy, and the duration of therapy. In patients treated with SGAs, the time to onset of any effect and to maximal effect was shorter, and response rates higher (80% versus 68%) in secondary DI compared with primary DI, but these differences were not statistically significant[.34](#page-4-23) Maximum effects of therapy were generally noted by 10 weeks in responders, suggesting that a lack of response by this time should prompt a change in treatment. The duration of symptoms may also affect outcome. In Trabert's study[,5](#page-4-4) the likelihood of a full remission was inversely correlated with the duration of symptoms, although this was not observed in patients treated with SGAs[.34](#page-4-23) Sustained therapy of at least 8 weeks' duration and treatment supervision by a psychiatrist may also be associated with improved response rates.[34](#page-4-23) Relapse rates are difficult to determine; they appear to be common and tend to respond well to re-institution of therapy, regardless of the anti-psychotic agent used.[8,22](#page-4-7) However, those who relapse soon after discontinuation of drug therapy on two or more occasions are likely going to require long-term or even lifetime therapy.
