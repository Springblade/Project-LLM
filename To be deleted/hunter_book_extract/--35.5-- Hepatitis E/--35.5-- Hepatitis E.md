# **35.5** Hepatitis E

*Samer S. El-Kamary, Shyamasundaran Kottilil*

## KEY FEATURES

- • Enteric transmitted virus causing 20% to 30% of acute viral hepatitis in many developing countries and rarely in the United States and Europe.
- • It has a single serotype and six genotypes.
- • Some genotypes (e.g., genotype-1) cause acute viral hepatitis in humans, whereas others (e.g., genotype-3) are zoonotic and primarily cause infection in animals, mainly pigs.
- • Water-borne outbreaks occur, primarily in the Indian subcontinent, and it can also be transmitted by the fecal–oral route, viremic blood exposures, and eating uncooked pork.
- • In rare instances, such as in immunocompromised hosts, hepatitis E infection can persist and lead to progressive liver disease.
- • Prevention is primarily related to improving sanitation; two effective vaccines have been developed but have not been marketed due to inadequate demand.

# **INTRODUCTION**

In 1983 HEV was visualized by immune electron microscopy in stool from infected patients. It was then transmitted to a human volunteer and cynomolgus monkeys, thereby establishing its role in enterically transmitted non-A, non-B (NANB) hepatitis[.1](#page-1-0) Development of specific diagnostic tests followed cloning of the HEV genome in 1990 and by recombinant DNA technology expressing viral antigens[.2](#page-1-1) HEV was retrospectively recognized as a major cause of fecal–oral-transmitted NANB hepatitis when clinical samples collected during epidemics of water-borne hepatitis in India in the 1950s and 1960s were serologically tested.[3,4](#page-1-2) HEV is a single-stranded, positive-sense RNA virus that has been placed in the genus *Hepevirus* but has not been assigned to a viral family.

# **EPIDEMIOLOGY**

HEV infections transmitted by a fecal–oral route are rarely detected in the United States and other developed countries. However, sporadic cases of HEV have been recognized in most developing countries, and major water-borne epidemics have been reported in India, Pakistan, Nepal, and Africa.[2](#page-1-1) HEV is also endemic to the remainder of Central and Southeast Asia, the Middle East, Africa, and Central America ([Fig. 35.5.1\)](#page-1-3). In these areas HEV is the etiologic cause of 20% to 30% of cases of acute hepatitis and even more so in the Indian subcontinent and during outbreaks. HEV is a risk to travelers to endemic areas, albeit less so than HAV.[5](#page-1-4)

Although sharing the same basic route of transmission as HAV, HEV infection in endemic countries occurs more often in the second and third decades of life, whereas HAV infection more commonly occurs in the first and second decades. Also, the secondary attack rate is lower for HEV than for HAV. Links to a common source of contaminated water are the rule during large outbreaks, and these often follow heavy rains. As with HAV, HEV infection can occur after exposure to contaminated blood products, due to viremia that occurs during acute infection.

HEV is a zoonosis having been isolated from pigs, rats, and other animals. The rare cases of HEV reported in North America, Europe, and Japan are due to human genotype-1 infections in travelers to endemic areas or due to the porcine genotype-3 infections in people exposed to pigs or who ate undercooked pig or boar in Japan[.6,7](#page-1-5) Genotype-3 HEV has been isolated from pigs in Egypt (which are rare in the country), and genotype-1 has been isolated from a few cases of HEV-caused acute hepatitis in humans. HEV causes 20% to 25% of the cases of acute hepatitis in Egypt[,8](#page-1-6) but it is uncertain whether zoonotic transmission of genotype-3 is the cause of the 70% to 80% rate of HEV antibodies in the country[.9,10](#page--1-0)

# **CLINICAL FEATURES**

The course of HEV infection is similar to that of hepatitis A. The incubation period averages 40 days (range 15–60 days), after which the virus replicates in the liver. HEV can be detected in stool and blood 3 to 4 weeks after ingestion, before the onset of symptoms, and for 1 to 2 weeks afterward. Like HAV, children often have asymptomatic, anicteric infections; however, the clinical attack rate is higher in the 15- to 40-year age group, and severity of illness increases with age.

Symptoms and signs are similar to those caused by other types of viral hepatitis: malaise, fatigue, anorexia, nausea and vomiting, jaundice and dark urine, abdominal pain, fever, and hepatomegaly. The most common laboratory findings include elevated bilirubin, ALT, AST, and alkaline phosphatase. Histopathologic findings in biopsies from patients with HEV hepatitis have included both cholestatic hepatitis and classic acute hepatitis changes.

Clinical symptoms, hyperbilirubinemia, and elevated aminotransferase levels generally resolve within 1 to 6 weeks after onset of illness. Jaundice may be prolonged with HEV infection, which may also cause fulminant hepatitis; 10% to 20% of pregnant women in the third trimester who are hospitalized with acute HEV infection during outbreaks in India were reported to have fatal fulminant hepatitis.[11,12](#page--1-1) HEV causes chronic infection very rarely in immunosuppressed patients.[13,14](#page--1-2)

## **DIAGNOSIS**

Acute and chronic HEV infection can be diagnosed as follow[s15:](#page--1-3) Proposed diagnostic criteria for HEV testing.

- • Acute HEV infection
  - • ALT >2 times baseline + HEV IgM reactive using two different assays *or*
  - • ALT >2 times baseline + HEV IgM reactive + HEV RNA detected in stool or blood *or*
  - • ALT >2 times baseline + HEV IgG > 2 weeks apart with greater than fivefold increase in titer *or*
  - • ALT >2 times baseline + HEV IgM reactive + interferon gamma enzyme linked immunospot assay (ELISPOT) for HEV (>50 HEV-specific spots/106 cells).
- • Chronic HEV infection
  - • HEV RNA detected twice over 6 months in stool or blood.

The titer of IgM anti-HEV declines rapidly but can be detected in some patients for 5 to 6 months. IgG HEV antibodies persist and often have been detected in persons from regions without recognized infection. Their presence must be coupled with the appropriate clinical and epidemiologic presentation. Acute HEV infection can also be diagnosed by detection of HEV in the stool or blood with PCR.

### **TREATMENT**

Like other clinical cases of acute hepatitis, supportive care, including rest, is recommended, <sup>16,17</sup> and if available, oral silymarin may be used to alleviate some symptoms. <sup>18</sup>

### PREVENTION AND CONTROL

HEV-caused acute hepatitis rarely occurs in developed countries. The primary means of control is through improvements in hygiene, especially by providing non-contaminated food and potable water. Immunization with recombinant HEV proteins can prevent HEV infection. Immunization with a vaccine based on the ORF-2 protein protected rhesus monkeys from intravenous challenge with both homologous and heterologous HEV. Protective vaccines have undergone successful phase III

clinical trials in Nepal and China but are not yet commercially available. 19,20
