# **<sup>37</sup> 37** Viral Hemorrhagic Fevers

*Timothy P. Endy*

#### **INTRODUCTION**

The viral hemorrhagic fever viruses discussed in this chapter (dengue is discussed in a separate chapter) represent a diverse group of viruses from four different families (Flaviviruses, Bunyaviruses, Filoviruses, and Arenaviruses) that are associated with dramatic epidemics and high mortality. Collectively these viruses have a high burden of disease around the world and are transmitted to humans through a variety of mechanisms to include insect vectors (arboviruses), contact with an animal reservoir (zoonotic), or direct contact with infected victims or material contaminated with infected secretions (fomites). All have an animal reservoir and/or sylvatic life cycle allowing a continuous environmental burden. Despite the diversity among these viruses, they share common features:

- • All are single-stranded RNA viruses contained in a lipid envelope
- • As RNA viruses, they have high mutation rates, genetic diversity, and the ability to adapt to a changing environment
- • They are capable of producing urban epidemics under the right conditions
- • There are concerns for their use as bioterrorism agents and/ or weapons of mass destruction
- • They are capable of producing severe hemorrhagic disease in humans associated with high mortalities
- • There are limited vaccines or therapeutics to prevent infection or treat disease
- • There is dramatic social and economic impact when outbreaks occur.

Understanding the viruses, epidemiology, pathogenesis, clinical presentation, and treatment as discussed in this chapter is of utmost importance to the clinician and tropical disease provider in recognizing, treating, and taking appropriate biosafety precautions. The social and financial impact of these diseases is considerable. In New York State from July to November 2015, the surveillance cost to travelers and health care workers potentially exposed during the Ebola outbreak was \$9.7 million, \$4.3 million in response to a single Ebola case, and \$1.9 million for active monitoring[.1](#page-0-0) In the Netherlands the costs of Ebola preparedness and response by the Dutch health systems was estimated to be €12.6 million (approximately \$US15 million).[2](#page-0-1) For countries directly affected by the Ebola outbreak (Guinea, Liberia, and Sierra Leone) the World Bank estimated the 2014 to 2015 outbreak to have reduced the gross domestic product by 2% to 5% for an estimated cost of \$US359 million[.3](#page-0-2) This does not account for the indirect costs that resulted from deaths, which is considerable[.4](#page-0-3) Considering our history of recurrent outbreaks of the viral hemorrhagic fever viruses; their unique ability to mutate and adapt to different environments; their continued presence in the environment; and human social factors such as rapid global transportation, increasing urbanization, and access to health care in developing countries, we should expect the viral hemorrhagic fever viruses to continue to produce epidemics and regional threats with the potential for global spread.

# **37.1** Yellow Fever

*J. Erin Staples, Marc Fischer*

#### KEY FEATURES

- • Yellow fever (YF) is a mosquito-borne viral disease.
- • YF virus is endemic to sub-Saharan Africa and tropical South America and is estimated to cause 200,000 disease cases and 30,000 deaths annually.
- • YF can result in jaundice and hemorrhagic manifestations and is fatal in 30% to 60% of persons with severe disease.
- • Because no treatment exists for YF, prevention through vaccination and the use of personal protective measures is critical to lower disease risk and mortality.

#### **INTRODUCTION**

Yellow fever (YF) virus, a mosquito-borne flavivirus, is present in tropical areas of Africa and South America. In humans, the majority of YF virus infections are asymptomatic. Clinical disease varies from a mild, undifferentiated febrile illness to severe disease with jaundice and hemorrhage. Because no specific anti-viral treatment exists for YF, prevention is critical to lower disease risk and mortality.

#### **EPIDEMIOLOGY**

The World Health Organization (WHO) estimates that YF virus causes 200,000 cases of clinical disease and 30,000 deaths globally each year. However, the majority of cases and deaths are not recognized because of the predominantly rural nature of the disease and inadequate surveillance and reporting. Over the past few decades, hundreds of cases have been reported annually in South America, primarily among men with occupational exposures in forested areas. In Africa, the number of cases reported annually varies substantially (range: 1–5000 cases) and is likely attributable to variations in recognition and reporting[.1](#page-3-0) The natural occurrence of disease can also fluctuate, being absent in certain areas for years before re-appearing, as was recently seen in Angola in 2016 and coastal Brazil in 2017.[2](#page-3-1) Delineation of affected areas depends on surveillance for animal reservoirs and vectors, accurate diagnosis, and prompt reporting of human cases[.3](#page-3-2)

## **NATURAL HISTORY, PATHOGENESIS, AND PATHOLOGY**

YF virus is a positive-sense RNA virus that belongs to the genus *Flavivirus* (family Flaviviridae). It is antigenically related to dengue, Zika, West Nile, St. Louis encephalitis, and Japanese encephalitis viruses. YF virus has three transmission cycles: jungle, savannah, and urban[.3,4](#page-3-2) The jungle cycle involves transmission of the virus between nonhuman primates and tree-hole-breeding mosquito species (i.e., *Aedes* or *Haemagogus* spp.) found in the forest canopy. The virus is transmitted via mosquitoes from monkeys to humans when they encroach into the jungle during occupational or recreational activities. In Africa, a savannah cycle involves transmission of the virus from tree-hole-breeding *Aedes* spp. to humans living or working in jungle border areas. In this cycle, mosquitoes may also transmit the virus between humans. The urban cycle involves transmission of the virus between humans and urban mosquitoes, primarily *Aedes aegypti*. Humans infected with YF virus experience the highest levels of viremia and are infectious to mosquitoes shortly before the onset of fever and for 3 to 5 days thereafter. Direct person-to-person transmission of YF virus has not been documented; however, perinatal transmission from an infected mother to her infant at the time of birth has been reported[,5](#page-3-3) and transmission might theoretically occur through blood transfusion, organ transplantation, intrauterine transmission, or breastfeeding.

# **CLINICAL FEATURES**

The majority of people infected with YF virus remain asymptomatic. For those with clinical disease, the incubation period is usually 3 to 9 days[.6](#page-3-4) In its mildest form, YF is a self-limited infection characterized by acute onset of fever and headache. A subset of patients experience other symptoms, including chills, myalgia, lumbosacral pain, anorexia, nausea, vomiting, and dizziness[.7](#page-3-5) Physical examination may demonstrate relative bradycardia in relation to elevated body temperature (Faget's sign). The patient is usually viremic during this period, which lasts for approximately 3 days. Most have an uneventful recovery, but in approximately 12% (range 5% to 26%) of persons who are infected, the illness recurs in a more severe form within 48 hours following the viremic period[.8](#page-3-6) The virus is generally absent from the blood during this phase of symptom recrudescence. Symptoms include fever, vomiting, epigastric pain, jaundice, renal insufficiency, and cardiovascular instability. A bleeding diathesis can occur with hematemesis, melena, metrorrhagia, hematuria, petechiae, ecchymoses, and epistaxis. Physical findings include scleral and dermal icterus, hemorrhages, and epigastric tenderness without hepatic enlargement. For patients with severe disease involving hepatorenal dysfunction, the casefatality ratio is 30% to 60%.[8](#page-3-6)

## **PATIENT EVALUATION, DIAGNOSIS, AND DIFFERENTIAL DIAGNOSIS**

Laboratory findings in patients with YF vary based on the severity and stage of illness. In the first week, leukopenia may occur; however, during the second week there may be leukocytosis. Hyperbilirubinemia may be present as early as the third day but usually peaks toward the end of the first week of illness. Elevations of serum transaminase levels occur in hepatorenal disease and may remain elevated for up to 2 months after onset. Patients with hemorrhagic manifestations often have elevated prothrombin and partial thromboplastin times, decreased platelet counts and fibrinogen, and presence of fibrin-split products.

Laboratory diagnosis is generally accomplished by testing serum for viral RNA or virus-specific IgM and neutralizing antibodies[.3](#page-3-2) During the first 3 to 4 days of illness, the virus may be detectable in the serum by isolation or reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR). However, by the time a diagnosis of YF is considered, the virus or viral RNA might not be detectable. Therefore, virus isolation and RT-PCR should not be used for excluding the diagnosis of YF. Serologic cross-reactions occur with other flaviviruses (e.g., West Nile or dengue viruses), so positive results should be confirmed with a more specific test (e.g., plaque-reduction neutralization test). Immunohistochemical staining of formalin-fixed material can detect YF viral antigen in pathologic specimens. Health care providers should contact their state or local health department or national laboratories for assistance with diagnostic testing for YF virus infections.

Preliminary diagnosis is based on the patient's clinical features, YF vaccination status, and travel history, including location, time of year, and activities.[4](#page-3-7) Mild YF cannot be clinically distinguished from a range of other infections. Cases of YF with jaundice must be differentiated from viral hepatitis, malaria, leptospirosis, Congo–Crimean hemorrhagic fever, Rift Valley fever, typhoid, Q fever, and typhus, as well as drug-induced and toxic causes of jaundice[.1](#page-3-0) Other viral hemorrhagic fevers, which usually present without jaundice, include dengue hemorrhagic fever; Lassa fever; Marburg and Ebola virus diseases; and Bolivian, Argentinean, and Venezuelan hemorrhagic fevers.

#### **TREATMENT AND PREVENTION**

Although multiple drugs have been evaluated or empirically used for YF, none has shown specific benefit.[9](#page-3-8) Management is supportive and based on symptoms and the organ systems involved. Rest, fluids, and acetaminophen or paracetamol can relieve milder symptoms of fever and myalgia. Aspirin and other non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs should be avoided because of the risk for hemorrhagic complications.

Because no treatment exists, prevention through use of personal protective measures and vaccination is critical to lower disease risk and mortality. Mosquito prevention measures that may lower the risk for YF and other vector-borne infectious diseases include using insect repellent, wearing permethrin-impregnated clothing, and staying in accommodations with screened or air-conditioned rooms.

A live-attenuated YF vaccine is recommended for those ≥9 months of age who are traveling to or living in areas of South America and Africa with a risk of YF virus transmission ([Fig. 37.1.1](#page-2-0)).[4,10](#page-3-7) Recent evaluations of existing data determined that a single dose of YF vaccine is sufficient for most individuals to confer sustained lifelong protective immunity against YF disease.[10–12](#page-3-9) International health regulations allow countries to require proof of YF vaccination at least 10 days earlier as a condition of entry for travelers arriving from certain countries to prevent importation and indigenous transmission of YF virus. The YF vaccination certificate for international travel is valid for life.[13](#page-3-10)

The most common adverse events reported after vaccination include fever, headache, myalgia, and injection site reactions[.1](#page-3-0) Rare but serious adverse events following vaccine administration include immediate hypersensitivity or anaphylactic reactions, YF vaccine– associated neurologic disease, and YF vaccine–associated viscerotropic disease[.4](#page-3-7) To minimize the risk for serious adverse events, health care providers should vaccinate only persons who are at risk for exposure to YF virus or who require proof of vaccination for country entry, and observe the contraindications and consider the precautions before administering YF vaccine [\(Table 37.1.1](#page-2-1))[.1,4,10](#page-3-0)
