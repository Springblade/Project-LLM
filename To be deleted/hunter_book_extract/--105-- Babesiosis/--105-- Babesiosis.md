# **105** Babesiosis

Edouard Vannier. Peter J. Krause

### **KEY FEATURES**

- Babesiosis is an emerging infectious disease caused by hemoprotozoan parasites. Frequent symptoms include fever, fatigue, chills, sweats, headache, and myalgia.
- Babesiosis typically is transmitted by *Ixodes* ticks, occasionally through blood transfusion, and rarely transplacentally or through solid organ transplantation.
- Young and otherwise healthy individuals typically experience a mild illness or no symptoms. Individuals who are elderly or immunocompromised are at increased risk for severe babesiosis.
- Definitive diagnosis is made by visualizing *Babesia* parasites on peripheral blood smears or amplifying Babesia DNA by polymerase chain reaction (PCR).
- Standard therapy consists of a 7- to 10-day course of oral atovaquone plus oral azithromycin. For severe babesiosis, azithromycin should be administered intravenously; intravenous clindamycin plus oral quinine is an alternative option. Partial or complete exchange transfusion is recommended in cases of high parasitemia, severe anemia, or organ compromise. Highly immunocompromised individuals should be treated for at least 6 consecutive weeks, including 2 final weeks during which parasites are no longer detected on blood smears.

#### INTRODUCTION

Babesiosis is a tick-borne infectious disease caused by hemoprotozoan parasites of the genus *Babesia*. Long known as an infection of wild and domesticated vertebrates, babesiosis was recognized as a human disease in 1957. Human babesiosis is caused by a few Babesia spp. and primarily occurs in temperate climates across the Northern Hemisphere (Fig. 105.1).

#### **EPIDEMIOLOGY**

#### **United States**

Approximately 2000 cases are reported annually to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), although seroprevalence and epidemiologic studies suggest a higher incidence.<sup>2-4</sup> Most cases are caused by *Babesia microti*, a parasite of small rodents, and occur in the Northeast (from Maine to Maryland) and the upper Midwest (Minnesota, Wisconsin).<sup>3,5</sup> The number of cases and the geographic range of babesiosis have steadily increased in the past two decades. Sporadic cases of *B. duncani* infection occur along the Pacific Coast. Isolated cases caused by B. divergens-like organisms have been reported from the states of Arkansas, Kentucky, Michigan, Missouri, and Washington.<sup>1</sup>

#### **Europe**

Approximately 40 cases have been attributed to B. divergens, a parasite of cattle.6 Most have occurred in France and Ireland, particularly in regions with extensive cattle farming. Isolated cases have been reported from Croatia, Poland, Finland, Sweden, Norway, Portugal, Spain, Turkey, and Georgia (ex-USSR). A few cases of autochthonous B. microti infection have been identified in Germany and Poland. The five cases of B. venatorum infection occurred in Italy, Austria, Germany, and Sweden.6

#### Asia

Babesiosis caused by B. microti has been documented in Taiwan, Japan, and mainland China, particularly along the border with Myanmar.<sup>1,7</sup> B. venatorum infection was first documented in the Xinjiang autonomous region in northwestern China and subsequently recognized as endemic in the northeastern province of Heilongjiang.<sup>8,9</sup> B. crassa-like organisms, which typically infect sheep, were recently identified in this province as the etiologic agent of a mild to moderate febrile illness. 10 In the Zhejiang province, a mild case was caused by a novel Babesia sp. named XXB/HangZhou. In South Korea, a severe case of babesiosis developed in a splenectomized woman infected with an isolate (KO1) closely related to those found in sheep.<sup>1</sup>

#### Rest of the World

Illness caused by B. microti has been documented in Australia (New South Wales), Canada (Manitoba), and Mexico (Yucatan). Asymptomatic *B. microti* infection has been reported from Bolivia and Brazil. Proximity with cattle best explains asymptomatic infection with B. bovis or B. bigemina in Cuba, Colombia, and Brazil. On the African continent, three cases have been reported from Egypt, one of which was likely acquired from a pet dog. In southern Africa, babesiosis was diagnosed in two patients who had traveled to Namibia and Zimbabwe.

## NATURAL HISTORY, PATHOGENESIS, AND PATHOLOGY

In the northeastern and upper Midwestern United States, most cases of *B. microti* infection develop 1 to 4 weeks after completion of a blood meal by the deer tick, *Ixodes scapularis*. Nearly half of patients do not recall a tick bite. Nymphs are the primary vector, but adult females also can transmit. Transmission occurs primarily from May through September, with three-quarters of cases presenting from June through August. B. microti also can be acquired during the transfusion of blood products, primarily packed red blood cells. 11 More than 200 such cases have been reported. Most occur from June through November, but cases are diagnosed year-round because asymptomatic infection can persist for >1 year. 11,12 Symptoms usually develop 3 to 7 weeks after transfusion (range: 1 week-6 months). Transfusion-transmitted babesiosis occurs in endemic areas but also in non-endemic areas when contaminated blood donations are distributed outside of endemic areas or when asymptomatically infected individuals donate blood in non-endemic areas. A few reports have documented the transmission of B. microti from mother to fetus and through solid organ transplantation.

In the western United States, *B. duncani* is transmitted by ticks (presumably the winter tick *Dermacentor albipictus*) and through blood transfusion. 1,11,13 In Europe, B. divergens is transmitted by all three stages of the sheep tick, I. ricinus. Symptoms develop

<span id="page-1-0"></span>**Fig. 105.1** Geographic distribution of human babesiosis and its tick vectors. Dark colors indicate areas where human babesiosis is endemic or sporadic (defined by ≥5 cases), whereas light colors indicate areas where tick vectors are present but human babesiosis is rare (<5 cases), undocumented, or absent. Circles depict single cases, except in three locations (Mexico, Montenegro, eastern Poland) where all patients were diagnosed at the same hospital. Colors distinguish the etiologic agents: red for *B. microti,* orange for *B. duncani,* blue for *B. divergens,* green for *B. venatorum,* pink for *B. crassa,* black for KO-1, and yellow for *Babesia* sp. XXB/HangZhou. White circles depict cases caused by *Babesia* isolates that were not characterized at the molecular level. Asymptomatic infections and cases of travel-associated babesiosis are omitted. *I. ricinus* and *I. persulcatus* are sympatric in southern Finland, Estonia, Latvia and northwestern Russia. The island of Hokkaido in northern Japan is enzootic for both *I. persulcatus* and *I. ovatus*.

1 to 3 weeks after tick bite. *I. ricinus* also is the vector for *B. venatorum* and *B. microti.* In Asia, *B. venatorum* and *B. microti* can be transmitted by the taiga tick, *I. persulcatus*. [9,14](#page-3-7) *B. microti* has been found in *I. ovatus* but the single case of *B. microti* infection in Japan was acquired through blood transfusion. *B. crassa* has been identified in *I. persulcatus* and *Haemaphysalis concinna* ticks.

Once deposited in the dermis, sporozoites reach the bloodstream and invade red blood cells.[1](#page-3-0) The parasitophagous membrane disappears and the free sporozoite differentiates into a trophozoite, which eventually undergoes binary fission to generate two to four merozoites. Merozoite egress triggers host cell lysis, thereby causing anemia, and is followed by immediate invasion of another red blood cell. Anemia also results from the clearance of uninfected red blood cells and the suppression of erythropoiesis. Inflammatory cytokines likely explain acute symptoms such as fever, chills, and myalgia. Resolution of parasitemia requires intact innate and adaptive immune responses. Antibodies are crucial for parasite clearance in immunocompromised patients,[15](#page-3-8) but their importance in immunocompetent patients is unclear. Autoantibodies, if produced, can amplify thrombocytopenia or prolong anemia[.16](#page-3-9)

## **CLINICAL FEATURES**

## *Babesia microti* **Infection**

Most patients experience a gradual onset of fatigue followed by fever as high as 40.9°C (105.6°F) and one or more of the following: chills, sweats, headache, and myalgia.[1](#page-3-0) Less frequent symptoms include arthralgia, anorexia, neck stiffness, non-productive cough, sore throat, nausea, and emotional lability. Vomiting, joint swelling, swollen glands, conjunctivitis, and photophobia seldom are experienced. Dark urine and jaundice are consistent with severe hemolytic anemia. Shortness of breath raises the possibility of pulmonary involvement and/or severe anemia. Severe babesiosis requires hospital admission, and nearly half of hospitalized patients develop one or more complications, including acute respiratory distress syndrome, disseminated intravascular coagulation, congestive heart failure, renal failure, splenic infarct or rupture, and shock.

## **Other** *Babesia* **Infections**

*B. duncani* infection ranges in severity from asymptomatic to fatal[.1](#page-3-0) Symptoms are similar to those caused by *B. microti.* Most patients infected with *B. divergens* are asplenic and present with a fulminant illness[.6](#page-3-3) Symptoms include high fever, shaking chills, intense sweats, headache, myalgia, and lumbar and abdominal pain. Dark urine and jaundice often are noted. *B. venatorum* infection usually is mild but can be severe in splenectomized patients.[6,8,9](#page-3-3)

## **PATIENT EVALUATION AND DIAGNOSIS**

A diagnosis of babesiosis should be considered in any person who presents with symptoms of babesiosis and who resides in, or has traveled to, an endemic area from late spring through early autumn or has received a blood transfusion within the past 6 months[.1,17](#page-3-0) On physical examination, fever is the salient feature.[1](#page-3-0) The skin may be pale or yellowish. An expanding, erythematous skin lesion suggests concurrent Lyme disease.[18](#page-3-10) Tenderness of the upper left quadrant suggests splenomegaly and may be accompanied by hepatomegaly. Abdominal pain or unexplained hypotension with increased heart rate raises the possibility of splenic rupture and hemoperitoneum.

Routine laboratory tests help guide the diagnosis. A complete blood count often reveals low hemoglobin, low hematocrit, and a low red blood count; an elevated reticulocyte count; and/or a low platelet count. The leukocyte count is normal to slightly decreased, with a "left shift." Neutropenia occurs in approximately three-quarters of infants and one-third of adults. Low haptoglobin and elevated lactate dehydrogenase levels are consistent with hemolytic anemia. In moderate to severe cases, liver enzymes (alkaline phosphatase, aspartate, and alanine aminotransferases) and bilirubin are elevated. Urinalysis may reveal hemoglobinuria, hematuria, excess urobilinogen, and/or proteinuria. Elevated levels of blood urea nitrogen and serum creatinine indicate renal compromise.

A definitive diagnosis can be made by microscopic analysis of Giemsa-stained thin blood smears [\(Fig. 105.2](#page-2-0)).[1,17](#page-3-0) Wright stain also can be used. Thick smears are informative, but *Babesia* spp. are small and can be missed. *Babesia* trophozoites typically appear as ring forms that can be mistaken for early-stage *Plasmodium falciparum* trophozoites. Merozoites often appear pear-shaped and occasionally are arranged in a tetrad ("Maltese cross"). When parasites are not detected on blood smears but the infection is still suspected, a *Babesia* polymerase chain reaction (PCR) test should be ordered ([Table 105.1](#page-2-1)). Real-time PCR assays detect as few as 0.1

to 10 parasites per µL of blood and allow speciation without the need for amplicon sequencing. A single positive serology cannot distinguish active from past infection ([Table 105.1](#page-2-1)). Thin blood smear, PCR, and serology are available from large commercial laboratories in endemic areas. Certain university laboratories and the CDC serve as reference laboratories.

## **TREATMENT**

## *Babesia microti* **Infection**

Atovaquone plus azithromycin is the mainstay of antimicrobial therapy. Clindamycin plus quinine, the first regimen reported to be effective for babesiosis, is considered an alternative choice ([Table 105.2](#page-3-11))[.1,17](#page-3-0) In a prospective, non-blinded, randomized trial, the two combinations were found to be equally effective in clearing symptoms and parasitemia in patients with non-life-threatening babesiosis, but those treated with atovaquone plus azithromycin experienced fewer adverse effects.[19](#page-3-12) A recent retrospective case series suggests that atovaquone plus azithromycin is effective in treating severe babesiosis, even in patients admitted to the intensive care unit (ICU).[20](#page-3-13) Microbial resistance to atovaquone plus azithromycin can develop in highly immunocompromised patients, particularly after premature interruption of treatment.[21,22](#page-3-14) Highly immunocompromised individuals are at risk for persistent or relapsing babesiosis and should be treated for at least 6 consecutive weeks, including 2 final weeks during which parasites are no longer detected on blood smears.[15](#page-3-8) If the patient fails to respond to atovaquone plus azithromycin, clindamycin plus quinine should be used[.1](#page-3-0) In case of quinine intolerance or if quinine toxicity is a concern, clindamycin plus atovaquone with or without azithromycin is another option[.17](#page-3-15) Partial or complete exchange transfusion is recommended for patients with high-grade parasitemia (≥10%); severe anemia (hemoglobin <10 g/dL) attributed to parasitemia; or pulmonary, renal, or hepatic compromise.[1,17](#page-3-0) Post-babesiosis warm autoimmune hemolytic anemia is best addressed with an immunosuppressive drug (e.g., prednisone), but may require blood transfusion.[16](#page-3-9) Despite therapy, *B. microti* infection is fatal in 3% to 9% of hospitalized patients and in 20% of those who acquired the infection through blood transfusion or are highly immunocompromised[.1,5,11,15](#page-3-0)

## **Other** *Babesia* **Infections**

*B. duncani* infection has been treated with clindamycin plus quinine; the efficacy of atovaquone plus azithromycin is unknown. Severe *B. divergens* infection in asplenic patients usually is managed with immediate exchange transfusion and clindamycin plus quinine[.6](#page-3-3) In a case of quinine toxicity, clindamycin plus quinine was interrupted and cure achieved with atovaquone plus azithromycin. A case of relapse was successfully treated with atovaquoneproguanil plus azithromycin. Most severe *B. venatorum* infections have been treated with clindamycin plus quinine, along with exchange transfusion and hemodialysis when necessary.[1,6](#page-3-0) A case of mild *B. venatorum* infection was cured with atovaquone plus azithromycin.[8](#page-3-4)

## **PREVENTION**

No vaccine is available for human babesiosis, and no antibiotic regimen has been tested for prophylaxis. People who live in endemic areas, particularly those at risk for severe babesiosis, should avoid tick-infested areas. They also should consider applying tick repellent (such as DEET) to the skin and impregnating clothing with permethrin.[1,17](#page-3-0) After outdoor activities, the skin should be examined and ticks carefully removed with tweezers. In the United States, individuals who have had babesiosis or are seropositive for *B. microti* are indefinitely deferred from donating blood.

Antibiotics are administered for 7 to 10 days, unless otherwise specified. Atovaquone plus azithromycin is the recommended regimen and should be administered orally. Azithromycin can be administered intravenously (along with oral atovaquone) to patients who experience severe disease, particularly to those who have difficulty taking antibiotics orally or do not absorb antibiotics well. Intravenous clindamycin plus oral quinine used to be the first line regimen for severe babesiosis but is now recommended when atovaquone plus azithromycin have failed to resolve symptoms. In case of quinine intolerance or if quinine toxicity is a concern, intravenous clindamycin can be combined with oral atovaquone with or without azithromycin. When symptoms have abated, antibiotics that were delivered intravenously can be taken orally. Highly immunocompromised patients should be treated for 6 consecutive weeks, including 2 final weeks during which parasites are no longer detected on blood smears. For some immunocompromised patients, successful regimens have included higher doses of oral azithromycin (600–1000 mg per day) combined with atovaquone (750 mg twice per day).

#### *Exchange transfusion*

Partial or complete exchange transfusion is recommended when a patient experiences high-grade parasitemia (≥10%), severe anemia (hemoglobin <10 g/dL) in the context of parasitemia, or organ (lung, renal, or hepatic) compromise. Cases of *B. divergens* infection often occur in splenectomized patients and are managed with clindamycin plus quinine and, in most cases, immediate exchange transfusion.
