# **98** *Cystoisospora belli* (syn. *Isospora belli*)

*Luther A. Bartelt, Rebecca A. Dillingham*

# KEY FEATURES

- • *Cystoisospora* (formerly *Isospora*) *belli* is a coccidian intestinal protozoa.
- • A cause of persistent diarrhea found in tropical areas in immunocompromised patients.
- • Diagnosis rests on stool microscopy.
- • Treatable with trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole (TMP-SMX).
- • Prevention rests on access to safe water and adequate sanitation.

### **INTRODUCTION**

*Isospora belli* was first identified in U.S. troops abroad during World War I, but was not studied further until 1970 when Brandborg and colleagues identified it in tissue sections from patients with malabsorptive enteritis.[1](#page-1-0) The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) has since revised the genus to *Cystoisospora belli* based on its morphologic and life cycle characteristics. *Isospora* remains the designation for species infecting passerine birds.[2](#page-1-1) Not all published work makes this distinction and, for now, *C. belli* and *I. belli* can remain synonymous for the clinician.

### **EPIDEMIOLOGY**

Humans are the only known hosts for *C. belli,* although other *Cystoisospora*/*Isospora* species are found throughout the animal kingdom. *C. belli* has been reported throughout the tropics and subtropics. *Cystoisospora* may cause 0.1% to 0.7% of cases of moderate to severe diarrhea in children less than 2 years of age where endemic[.2](#page-1-1) A community-based study of children in Guinea-Bissau found a low incidence (11 cases/168.7 child years at risk), but a strong association with diarrhea—as strong as any enteropathogen studied.[3](#page-1-2) Even in endemic areas, infection is most common in those with profound immunocompromise. A hospital-based study from Ethiopia evaluated causes of diarrhea and found infection only in HIV-infected persons at a rate of 7%.[4](#page-1-3) In studies of HIV-infected patients with diarrhea in Haiti, sub-Saharan Africa, and South Asia, *C. belli* was identified in 3% to 26% of stool specimens examined.[5–7](#page-1-4) Outside of endemic areas, disease is occasionally seen in patients with a history of travel to these areas or immunocompromise, including instances after organ transplantation.[8](#page-1-5)

# **NATURAL HISTORY, PATHOGENESIS, AND PATHOLOGY**

Acquisition of *Cystoisospora* is thought to be caused by ingestion of food or water contaminated with mature oocysts from human feces. When observed histopathologically, *C. belli* can be found invading beyond the epithelium into the lamina propria.[1](#page-1-0) Infiltration of eosinophils into the lamina propria and peripheral eosinophilia can be seen.[9](#page-2-2)

## **CLINICAL FEATURES**

*C. belli* generally produces an asymptomatic or self-limited diarrheal illness in otherwise healthy persons. Symptoms are non-specific, with watery diarrhea and abdominal pain, cramps, nausea, and low-grade fever usually lasting less than 1 month. In children in endemic areas, *C. belli* was recently associated with dysentery[.2](#page-1-1) In immunocompromised patients, diarrhea may be prolonged and more severe. In one study of HIV-infected patients, the median duration of diarrhea was 5.8 months[.4](#page-1-3) Rarely, dissemination of infection to mesenteric and tracheobronchial lymph nodes, liver, gallbladder, or spleen has been reported.[10–12](#page-2-3)

# **PATIENT EVALUATION, DIAGNOSIS, AND DIFFERENTIAL DIAGNOSIS**

Cystoisosporiasis should be considered in residents of, or travelers to, tropical areas who experience persistent diarrhea. There are no characteristic physical findings or laboratory abnormalities, although in non-HIV–infected individuals peripheral eosinophilia may be present, as are Charcot–Leyden crystals in the stool[.9](#page-2-2) Fecal leukocytes usually are not seen.[5](#page-1-4) *Cystoisospora* infection is confirmed by stool microscopy [\(Fig. 98.1\)](#page-1-6). The oocysts can be seen with saline wet mount, but are commonly visualized after modified acid-fast staining and are clearly distinguishable because of their large and elliptical size (10–30 µm). Other techniques, including lactophenol cotton blue staining, the auramine-rhodamine technique, Giemsa staining, and the heated safranin-methylene blue technique, have also been used. Shedding of oocysts may be seen[.9](#page-2-2) No serologic tests for *Cystoisospora* are commercially available. Polymerase chain reaction (PCR) assays for use on stool samples have been developed in research labs[.13](#page-2-4)

### **TREATMENT**

Cystoisosporiasis can be treated successfully in patients with or without immunocompromise, though relapse or re-infection occurs in the latter. The regimen of choice for adults in both groups is one double-strength tablet of trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole (TMP/SMX; 160 mg/800 mg) orally two to four times daily for 10 days (the higher dose may be needed for immunocompromised patients). In Haiti, this higher dose resulted in complete symptomatic relief for most affected HIV patients within 2 to 3 days and for all patients within 7 days[.4,14](#page-1-3) In Haiti, 47% of HIV-infected individuals who did not receive prophylaxis after treatment for cystoisosporiasis relapse[d4](#page-1-3) ; therefore maintenance therapy is recommended for immunocompromised individuals with one of two regimens—one double-strength TMP-SMX tablet three times a week or one Fansidar tablet (pyrimethamine 25 mg plus sulfadoxine 500 mg) once a week.[15](#page-2-1) Relapse has been reported despite immune reconstitution.[16](#page-2-5) For treatment of patients who are intolerant of sulfonamide-containing medications, alternative regimens include ciprofloxacin 500 mg twice daily for 7 days or oral pyrimethamine 50 to 75 mg/day in individual doses (plus leucovorin 10–25 mg/day)[.14,17](#page-2-0) Nitazoxanide appeared effective in some patients with HIV in Mali,[18](#page-2-6) but comparative studies with

TMP-SMX are lacking. In cases of severe extra-intestinal disease or during intestinal malabsorption, treatment with intravenous TMP/SMX has been used[.19](#page-2-8) The presence of cystoisosporiasis should not delay the initiation of antiretroviral therapy in HIVinfected patients requiring therap[y6](#page-1-7) [\(Table 98.1\)](#page-1-8).
