# **104** Leishmaniasis

*Naomi E. Aronson, Alan J. Magill* †

### KEY FEATURES

- • Leishmaniasis is a complex of sandfly bite–transmitted protozoan parasitic diseases, which are endemic to nearly 100 countries involving five continents.
- • Leishmaniasis is a neglected tropical disease, found in tropical and sub-tropical regions; visceral leishmaniasis is often associated with poverty, whereas cutaneous leishmaniasis tracks with conflict and population movement.
- • There are three general leishmaniasis syndromes: visceral leishmaniasis (second in mortality to malaria among parasitic diseases), cutaneous leishmaniasis (which is highly
- associated with social stigmatization when scars of lesions are visible, such as on the face), and mucosal leishmaniasis (a disfiguring complication of New World cutaneous leishmaniasis).
- • Definitive diagnosis of leishmaniasis requires demonstration of the amastigote using histopathology, special culturing, or molecular methods.
- • Treatment varies by *Leishmania* species, geography, host factors, and syndrome. Miltefosine and liposomal amphotericin have replaced the traditional pentavalent antimony therapy in much of the world.

## **104.1** Leishmaniasis: General Principles

*Naomi E. Aronson, Alan J. Magill* [†](#page-0-0)

#### **DEFINITION**

Protozoan parasites of the genus *Leishmania,* transmitted by sandflies of the genera *Phlebotomus* and *Sergentomyia* (Old World leishmaniasis)[1](#page-3-0) and *Lutzomyia* (New World leishmaniasis) cause a diverse group of cutaneous, mucosal, and visceral clinical syndromes that can be referred to as the *leishmaniases*.

#### **LIFE CYCLE**

The *Leishmania* life cycle is shown in [Fig. 104.1.1](#page-1-0). Promastigotes from an infected female sandfly are introduced into the skin of a vertebrate host during a blood meal. The promastigotes invade reticulo-endothelial cells and transform into amastigotes (round- or oval-shaped structures) measuring 2 to 5 ∝m in diameter [\(Fig.](#page-1-1) [104.1.2](#page-1-1)). Amastigotes multiply within phagolysosomes, infected cells rupture, and amastigotes invade other reticuloendothelial cells[.2](#page-3-1) In Wright's- or Giemsa-stained preparations, the amastigote's pale blue cytoplasm is surrounded by a plasma membrane and contains a large, dark-purple nucleus and a small, purple-red, rod-shaped structure—the kinetoplast (see [Fig. 104.1.2B](#page-1-1)). Sandflies feeding on infected individuals ingest parasitized cells, and the amastigotes transform into promastigotes, which multiply in the gut and migrate to the proboscis, completing the cycle.

#### **TAXONOMY**

<span id="page-0-0"></span>The taxonomy of *Leishmania* can be confusing; there is no single, generally agreed-upon classification. One clinically useful classification is presented in [Table 104.1.1.](#page-2-0) Although minor differences in size and morphology of amastigotes are reported, the species that infect humans cannot be reliably distinguished morphologically. Reference isolates are assigned to species and sub-species based on their geographic origin, the clinical syndrome they produce, and developmental biology in sandflies (*Leishmania* versus *Viannia*). Traditionally, species designation is assigned by analyzing promastigotes derived from in vitro culture by protein electrophoresis, and the pattern of isoenzymes obtained is compared with reference standards. Molecular methods to characterize nuclear and kinetoplast DNA from tissue specimens and cultured isolates are available and widely used.

#### **CLINICAL CLASSIFICATION**

A simplified clinical classification separates the leishmaniases into three major syndromes: (1) visceral leishmaniasis (VL), (2) cutaneous leishmaniasis (CL), and (3) mucosal leishmaniasis (ML) (see [Table](#page-2-0) [104.1.1\)](#page-2-0). VL (Kala-azar) is classically characterized by fever, wasting, pancytopenia, hepatosplenomegaly (especially splenomegaly), and hypergammaglobulinemia. With "incomplete," or atypical, syndromes, in which one or more of these clinical features are missing, sub-clinical and asymptomatic VL are common. VL is usually caused by parasites of the *Leishmania donovani* complex (including *L. donovani* and *L. infantum [syn. chagasi]*). The typical clinical presentation of CL is a localized, non-healing, often ulcerative skin lesion(s). Less common CL presentations include nodular, psoriasiform, and verrucous forms. Other unusual cutaneous syndromes include diffuse CL, disseminated CL, post–Kala-azar dermal leishmaniasis (PKDL), and leishmaniasis recidivans. In the New World, ML is most often associated with *L. (Viannia) braziliensis, L.(V.) guyanensis,* and *L.(V.) panamensis* and characterized by a primary cutaneous lesion that may be co-existent with or followed months to years later by destructive nasopharyngeal lesions ("espundia"). In the Old World, ML-like syndromes associated with *L. major, L. infantum,* and *L. aethiopica* have been reported.

Another clinically useful classification is to describe clinical syndromes in terms of the parasite burden. Polyparasitic syndromes, such as VL and diffuse CL, are characterized by large numbers of parasites in the host. Oligoparasitic syndromes, such as ML and leishmaniasis recidivans, have relatively fewer parasites. This has implications for the clinician in choosing the best technique for attaining a diagnosis and determining optimal treatment.

#### **TRANSMISSION AND EPIDEMIOLOGY**

The phlebotomine sandflies that transmit *Leishmania* parasites are small (1.5–2.5 mm), hairy flies that are recognized by their characteristic hopping movement and the position of their wings, which are held in a nearly erect V configuration over the body ([Fig. 104.1.3](#page-2-1)). Sandflies are generally weak fliers, inactive in daylight, and seek shelter in dark places. They breed in damp places rich in organic matter, for example, leaf litter in tropical rainforests, rubble and loose earth, caves, and rock holes.[3](#page-3-2) Female sandflies feed on a variety of warm- and cold-blooded hosts, including humans, cats, dogs, rodents, hares, cattle, bats, birds, and lizards.

<span id="page-2-1"></span>They can acquire *Leishmania* with their first blood meal and are capable of disease transmission 7 to 10 days later. They then remain infective throughout adult life, which is usually only a few weeks. *Leishmania*-infected sandflies have abnormal feeding behavior, with increased probing while attempting to take a blood meal. This behavior may facilitate transmission to the vertebrate host, as well as lead to a chain of skin lesions. Inoculation with as few as 10 *Leishmania* parasites can cause infection.[4](#page-3-3)

All species of *Leishmania* are deposited into the skin by the sandfly vector in concert with some vector saliva. Sandfly saliva contains a variety of molecules that may facilitate infection, most studied in *Lutzomyia* species, including maxadilan, a potent vasodilatory peptide; SALO, a classical complement pathway inhibitor; Lundep, an endonuclease; and Lufaxin, a protein that inhibits the alternate pathway of complement[.5–8](#page-3-4) Adenosine and PpSP15 have immunomodulatory effects in *Phlebotomus* species.[9](#page-3-5) Substances in sandfly saliva are at least partly responsible for the tropism observed in *Leishmania* isolates and may provide a degree of protective efficacy against VL and CL.[10](#page-3-6)

Transmission of *Leishmania* is either zoonotic (mammalian reservoir, often canine or rodent reservoirs) or anthroponotic (human reservoir). Zoonotic transmission can occur in wild (sylvatic) or peri-domestic situations. Two important human diseases—Indian subcontinent VL caused by *L. donovani* and urban CL caused by *L. tropica*—are characterized by anthroponotic (human–sandfly– human) transmission[.11](#page-3-7)

Globally, there were an estimated 4 million new CL and 61,000 new VL cases in 2015 and 13,700 deaths from VL in 2016[;12,13](#page-3-8) about a billion persons (VL 616 million/CL 431 million) are at risk [\(http://www.who.int/leishmaniasis/burden/en/](http://www.who.int/leishmaniasis/burden/en/)). CL is endemic in more than 70 countries of the tropics and neo-tropics, with the majority of cases reported from Afghanistan, Algeria, Brazil, Colombia, Iran, Pakistan, Peru, Sudan, Syrian Arab Republic, Tunisia, and Yemen[14](#page-3-9) ([http://www.who.int/leishmaniasis/burden/](http://www.who.int/leishmaniasis/burden/en) [en](http://www.who.int/leishmaniasis/burden/en)). CL is under-reported in most areas, and active surveillance reveals a fivefold to tenfold higher number of actual cases. Ninety percent of the world's VL cases were reported from Brazil, Ethiopia, India, Kenya, Somalia, South Sudan, and Sudan ([http://www.who.int/](http://www.who.int/leishmaniasis/burden/en/) [leishmaniasis/burden/en/\)](http://www.who.int/leishmaniasis/burden/en/)[.14](#page-3-9) Incident cases of VL in the Indian subcontinent have decreased 75% since 2005, with an active elimination program [\(www.who.int/gho/neglected\\_diseases/](http://www.who.int/gho/neglected_diseases/leishmaniasis/en/) [leishmaniasis/en/](http://www.who.int/gho/neglected_diseases/leishmaniasis/en/)). Although most parasite transmission is by the bite of infected sandflies, several other routes of transmission include blood transfusion,[15](#page-3-10) needle sharing in drugs users[,16](#page-3-11) congenital transmission,[17](#page--1-0) and laboratory accidents.[18](#page--1-1)

#### **IMMUNOLOGY**

The protective immune response to leishmaniasis is primarily cell mediated. High titers of antibodies detected in VL appear to have little role in host defense against the parasite. In contrast, a positive leishmanin skin test or interferon-gamma release assay result correlates with resistance to leishmaniasis. Some patients with sub-clinical, self-curing VL have positive leishmanin skin tests associated with well-developed tuberculoid granulomas demonstrated in liver biopsies. Cell-mediated immunity (CMI) is not entirely beneficial, as it also causes tissue destruction.

A protective immune response to *Leishmania* includes production of interleukin (IL)-12, interferon-gamma, and tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNF-〈) in VL; for CL it is IL-2, IL-12, and interferongamma. Macrophages are stimulated to kill intracellular amastigotes through release of reactive oxygen species and nitric oxide. In CL, memory T cells and CD8 T cells are important for durable immune responses. Contrarily, IL-10 and transforming growth factor (TGF) beta are associated with active VL or persistence of CL. Poor nutritional status and immune-compromised states are major risk factors for symptomatic VL.

*Leishmania* RNA viruses, double-stranded RNA viruses that parasitize the parasite, have been found in many *Leishmania* species, particularly in South America. An association with ML and clinically antimony-unresponsive CL/ML has been reported[.19,20](#page--1-2)

#### **SPECTRUM OF CLINICAL DISEASE**

In leishmaniasis, there is a spectrum of clinical disease[.21](#page--1-3) In CL, the spectrum varies from progressive non-healing lesions associated with anergy (diffuse CL) to the exaggerated hypersensitivity seen in ML and leishmaniasis recidivans, in which severe tissue damage is mediated by the immune response. In VL, many infections are asymptomatic or sub-clinical and self-healing, although malnutrition or an immunosuppressive process can reactivate latent infection[.22](#page--1-4)

#### **DIAGNOSTIC TESTING**

Parasitologic diagnosis refers to the demonstration of amastigotes in tissues or clinical specimens, visualizing promastigotes within in vitro cultures, or the detection of parasite genetic material with molecular assays. Immunologic diagnosis refers to the detection of an antibody or delayed-type hypersensitivity/interferon-gamma release assay response in the host to *Leishmania* antigens.

It is important to note there is not a single diagnostic test that is optimal in all clinical settings. It is always preferable to perform more than one parasitologic assay when possible. For example, smear, culture, and polymerase chain reaction (PCR) can be employed for the confirmation of parasite presence.

Promastigotes can be grown in a variety of media at 22°C to 25°C. A biphasic medium, for example, Nicolle's modification of Novy and MacNeal's medium (NNN) is often used,[23](#page--1-5) or Schneider's *Drosophila* medium supplemented with fetal bovine serum. Promastigotes are generally noted 2 to 7 days after inoculation of amastigotes into Schneider's medium and after 7 to 21 days in NNN medium.

Molecular-based assays are the most sensitive diagnostic approach[.24](#page--1-6) Whole-blood PCR had a pooled sensitivity of 93% and specificity of 95.6%[.25](#page--1-7) There was no statistical difference in *Leishmania* detection between samples of bone marrow, buffy coat, or whole blood. In another study, splenic parasite load and quantitative PCR parasite equivalents were positively correlated[.26](#page--1-8) PCR is also time saving compared with parasite culture. However, there is a lack of standardization of PCR assays with different techniques, targets, and levels of sensitivity; additional performance characteristics remain to be defined in more detail. Molecular assays are also being used to determine species identification, as is matrixassisted laser desorption/ionization (MALDI) mass spectrometry technology.[27](#page--1-9)

#### **PRINCIPLES OF TREATMENT**

#### **Definition of Cure**

Cure or response to treatment is defined as clinical or parasitologic. Achievement of clinical cure is the patient care goal. Clinical cure is the resolution of the signs and symptoms of disease within a defined period. A satisfactory clinical response to VL treatment is resolution of fever and an improved sense of well-being in the first week accompanied by resolution of anemia, splenomegaly, and weight gain over months. Final clinical cure is achieved with no recurrence of symptoms (no relapse) at 6 months. In CL, the complete epithelialization of an ulcer at 3 months without recurrence up to 6 months is a common definition of clinical cure.

Parasitologic cure refers to the eradication of *Leishmania* parasites, which occurs infrequently; infection is usually life-long. Parasitologic response is often defined as the decrease or absence of parasites by smear or culture within a defined period after treatment. For example, a splenic aspiration may be 3+ before therapy and smear-negative at the end of therapy, indicating a parasitologic response. Parasitologic response end points are utilized in research studies to assess response to treatment but are not commonly used or recommended in routine clinical care.

#### **Persistence of Viable Parasites**

Successful chemotherapy leading to clinical cure does not eradicate parasites from the host. For example, viable parasites can be obtained from healed scars of New World CL years after successful therapy leading to clinical cure[.28](#page--1-10) Reactivation of VL after immunosuppression results from old foci of infection that were controlled by an immune response[.29](#page--1-11) Recurrent disease in patients with AIDS–*Leishmania* co-infections supports the fact that an intact cellular immune response is required for sustained clinical cure.

#### **Variability of Treatment Regimens**

*Leishmania* are a diverse group of protozoan parasites found in many different geographic regions of the tropical and sub-tropical world. Each parasite "species" exists within a unique zoonotic or anthroponotic cycle. Each geographic region has a unique combination of parasite strains, sandfly vectors, mammalian reservoirs, and human hosts of different genetic backgrounds. A treatment regimen that is efficacious in one area may not be efficacious in another. For example, treatment that works best for VL in India may not be optimal for East Africa[.30](#page--1-12) Miltefosine treatment of *L.*(*V.*) *braziliensis* CL in Guatemala resulted in poor healing responses (45%), but efficacy was 85% for *L.*(*V.*) *braziliensis* CL in Brazil[.31,32](#page--1-13) Therefore it is not possible, or desirable, to recommend a single treatment regimen that would be safe and effective for all forms of the disease in all geographic regions.
