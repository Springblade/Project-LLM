# **<sup>150</sup> 150** Fever in the Returned Traveler

*Michael Marks, Victoria Johnston, Michael Brown*

# KEY FEATURES

- • Travel, especially to low-income regions, is associated with an increased risk of infections not typically seen in high-income countries (e.g., malaria, enteric fever, dengue, chikungunya, Zika, and schistosomiasis).
- • Although gastroenteritis, respiratory tract infections, and self-limiting viral infections are common, a minority of patients will have a potentially life-threatening tropical infection.
- • The evaluation of an ill returned traveler requires a detailed travel history with an understanding of the geographic distribution of infections, risk factors for acquisition, incubation periods, clinical presentations, and appropriate laboratory investigations.
- • A syndromic approach to specific investigations, and to presumptive therapy pending laboratory confirmation of the diagnosis, is appropriate.
- • Travel is also a risk factor for acquisition of antimicrobial-resistant bacteria, such as those containing extended spectrum β-lactamases, that become part of the traveler's colonizing flora.
- • As a rule, malaria should be excluded in all travelers presenting with a fever who have visited the tropics.

# **INTRODUCTION**

Up to 70% of travelers to low-income regions report health problems, the majority of which are self-limiting; however 8% to 15% of travelers are ill enough to seek medical attention while abroad or on return home, with fever a common presenting complaint[.1–3](#page-8-1) The etiology is often a self-limiting, globally endemic infection, such as influenza or gastroenteritis; however, conditions not normally seen in the patient's country of origin are increasingly seen. These can be life threatening, such as malaria, and others can have public health consequences, such as enteric fever.

To evaluate febrile returned travelers, it is necessary to have an understanding of the geographic distribution of infections, risk factors for acquisition, incubation periods, and clinical presentations. A risk assessment can then be made, initial investigations instigated, and, when appropriate, presumptive therapy started.

# **EPIDEMIOLOGY**

The epidemiology of fever in returned travelers reflects factors relating to the individual traveler and to the wide spectrum of etiologic pathogens. Many pathogens—for example, influenza—have a global distribution; however, others are only found in distinct geographic locations. Among patients with undifferentiated fever, malaria, dengue, and enteric fever are the most common tropical diagnoses.[3](#page-8-2) The following factors influence an individual's risk of acquiring infection [\(Table 150.1\)](#page-1-0)[.4](#page-8-3)

#### **Individual Factors**

- • *Purpose and duration of travel:* Individuals visiting friends and relations (VFR) and long-stay travelers (e.g., aid workers) are at greatest risk of acquiring malaria, enteric fever, hepatitis A, tuberculosis, and sexually transmitted infections (STIs), including HIV. This is partly due to longer duration of travel and closer proximity to the local population.
- • *Immune status:* Migrants returning to their home countries may be immune to certain infections, such as hepatitis A and acute schistosomiasis; however, they may incorrectly consider themselves immune to others, such as malaria. Consequently, VFR travelers are less likely to seek pre-travel advice, take malaria prophylaxis, or receive vaccines.[4](#page-8-3) Travelers with HIV, malignancy, or on immunosuppressant drugs are at increased risk of opportunistic infections, including non-typhoidal *Salmonella* and penicilliosis.
- • *Risk activities:* Certain activities are an exposure risk (e.g., freshwater swimming and schistosomiasis, unprotected sexual intercourse and HIV).

# **Pathogen Factors**

- • *Geographic distribution:* Risk varies with country and environment (e.g., urban or rural, mountains or coastal plains). Although malaria is the most common infection diagnosed in travelers returned from sub-Saharan Africa, dengue is more prevalent in travelers returning from Southeast Asia and enteric fever from southcentral Asia (see [Table 150.1\)](#page-1-0).
- • *Incubation period:* Most travelers become symptomatic within 21 days of exposure, with the majority presenting within 1 month of return. However, some pathogens have a much longer incubation period (e.g., *Plasmodium vivax* and tuberculosis); patients can present months or, rarely, years later ([Table 150.2](#page-2-0)).

#### **CLINICAL FEATURES**

Patients can present with undifferentiated fever or with organspecific symptoms, such as gastroenteritis or respiratory infection. For more detailed descriptions, relevant chapters on specific infections should be consulted.

### **Undifferentiated Fever**

#### Malaria

Malaria is a potentially fatal infection in travelers returning from the tropics, particularly from sub-Saharan Africa.[5](#page-8-0) It should be excluded in all travelers with a history of fever. The risk of travelers acquiring malaria outside sub-Saharan Africa has decreased substantially in recent years, especially in those from India and South America[.6](#page-8-4) Most short-term travelers present within 1 month of return; however, *P. falciparum* occasionally presents up to 6 months later, and *P. vivax, P. ovale,* and *P. malariae* can present a year or more after return.[7](#page-8-5) Many travelers do not take chemoprophylaxis, or take it inadequately.[4](#page-8-3) When malaria is acquired despite chemoprophylaxis, the onset of symptoms is often delayed, severity of illness reduced, and microbiologic diagnosis may be obscured.[8](#page-8-6) Chemoprophylaxis can obscure the diagnosis, so in

cases where malaria is thought likely, chemoprophylaxis can be stopped while patients are investigated[.5](#page-8-0)

Nearly all patients with malaria give a history of fever; however, up to half are afebrile on presentation, although specific fever patterns are uncommon[.9](#page-8-7) Headache, myalgia, arthralgia, and malaise are frequently described, and some patients report diarrhea or cough. Complications occur mainly with *P. falciparum* infection but can also occur after infection with *P. vivax* and *P. knowlesi.* In patients with confusion, seizures, or reduced consciousness level, cerebral malaria or hypoglycemia should be considered; hypoxia, tachypnea, and signs of pulmonary edema indicate respiratory involvement.

*CMV*, Cytomegalovirus; *EBV*, Epstein–Barr virus; *HIV*, human immunodeficiency virus; *MERS*, Middle Eastern Respiratory Syndrome. Table adapted with permission from British Infection Society. Fever in returned travelers presenting in the United Kingdom: recommendations for investigation and initial management.[5](#page-8-0)

#### Enteric Fever (*Salmonella* Typhi, *S.* Paratyphi)

Enteric fever is a potentially life-threatening infection that requires early diagnosis and management. It is seen particularly in VFR travelers returning from Asia[,3](#page-8-2) although there have been outbreaks in Malawi and Kenya, and this may translate into more imported cases[.10](#page-8-8) With an incubation period of 7 to 18 days (range up to 60 days), most patients present within a month of return. A history of vaccination pre-travel has little predictive value; it provides incomplete protection against *S.* Typhi and no protection against *S.* Paratyphi.

In addition to fever, symptoms include headache, constipation/ diarrhea, and dry cough. Complications, in particular encephalopathy and gastrointestinal bleeding and intestinal perforation, occur infrequently; they are more likely if the duration of illness is >2 weeks.

#### Rickettsiae

The most common travel-associated rickettsial infections are due to *Rickettsia africae* (African tick typhus). Endemic throughout sub-Saharan Africa, it is a common diagnosis in those who have visited game parks in southern Africa. *R. conorii* (Mediterranean spotted

**Fig. 150.1** Patient returned 2 days previously from a safari holiday in Botswana. On further examination, an eschar was found. Diagnosis: African tick typhus.

<span id="page-2-1"></span>fever or tick bite fever) is endemic throughout sub-Saharan Africa, the Mediterranean, Caspian littoral countries, the Indian subcontinent, and the Middle East. Travelers infected with *R. typhi* (murine typhus) and *Orientia tsutsugamushi* (scrub typhus) are rarely seen.

Rickettsiae have an incubation period of 5 to 7 days (up to 10 days) and similar presentations. More than 80% of patients infected with *R. africae* or *R. conorii* describe fever, headache, and myalgia. The classic signs of inoculation eschar, rash, and lymphadenitis are seen in <50%; however, retrospective cohorts report higher rates [\(Fig. 150.1\)](#page-2-1).[11](#page-8-9) Complications (e.g., reactive arthritis) are rarely encountered in African tick typhus; mortality rates of up to 32% have been reported for Mediterranean tick bite fever, 17% for scrub typhus, and 4% for murine typhus.[12–14](#page-8-10)

#### Arbovirus

There are over 500 arthropod-borne viruses worldwide, although not all cause human disease. The majority are usually restricted to specific geographic locations; for example, Ross River virus in Australia. However, due to a combination of international travel and changes in vector distribution there have been changes in the distribution of many arboviruses. They have short incubation periods (<1 week) and result in self-limiting illnesses. Four clinical presentations predominate:

- • Systemic febrile illness (e.g., all arboviruses)
- • Hemorrhagic fever (e.g., dengue, yellow fever, Rift Valley fever, Crimean-Congo hemorrhagic fever)
- • Acute encephalitis (e.g., Japanese encephalitis, Rift Valley fever, West Nile virus, Eastern and Western equine encephalitis viruses)
- • Polyarthralgia or arthritis (e.g., chikungunya, Ross River)

Dengue is the most common arbovirus in travelers. Although widespread, it is a cause of fever mainly in those returning from Asia, the Caribbean, and South America[.15](#page-9-0) Most travelers present with a febrile illness associated with headache, retro-orbital pain, myalgia, arthralgia (especially back pain), and rash[.15](#page-9-0) The rash, initially erythrodermic, becomes petechial with disease progression ([Fig. 150.2\)](#page-3-0). Hepatitis, myocarditis, encephalitis, and neuropathy can occur. Bleeding gums, epistaxis, and gastrointestinal bleeding occur but are not necessarily indicative of dengue hemorrhagic fever, which, like dengue shock syndrome, is rare in travelers.

Chikungunya has a distribution similar to dengue with large epidemics in the Caribbean, South America, India, and Southeast Asia[.16](#page-9-1) The clinical presentation is similar to classic dengue fever; however, arthralgia is more prominent. In the majority of cases,

<span id="page-3-0"></span>the arthralgia settles; 5% to 30% develop chronic arthropathy with pain, stiffness and swelling lasting months to years.[17,18](#page-9-2)

Zika virus has caused large outbreaks in the Caribbean, South and Central America, and the Pacific and is increasingly reported in Asia.[19](#page-9-3) Acutely, the disease is similar to dengue. However, Guillain–Barré syndrome can be a complication, and during pregnancy Zika can lead to stillbirth and is associated with congenital abnormalities, including fetal microcephaly. Sexual transmission of Zika is well described[.19](#page-9-3) No clinical features reliably distinguish dengue, chikungunya, and Zika infection, although thrombocytopenia is normally more pronounced in dengue[.20](#page-9-4)

Large outbreaks of yellow fever continue to occur in both Africa and South America and may be associated with an increased risk of imported cases among travelers.

#### Acute Schistosomiasis (Katayama Fever)

This should be considered in febrile travelers returning from Africa. Travelers give a history of freshwater exposure 4 to 6 weeks (up to 9) before symptom onset. Some describe a self-resolving itchy rash immediately after exposure (swimmer's itch). Symptoms and signs include fever, lethargy, myalgia, arthralgia, cough, wheeze, headache, urticarial rash, diarrhea, and hepatosplenomegaly.[21](#page-9-5) The eosinophil count is usually elevated with acute schistosomiasis and provides supportive evidence for the diagnosis, but it may only appear a few days after symptom onset. Acute symptoms are self-limiting in most cases.

#### Leptospirosis

Leptospirosis has a global distribution. Infection occurs after exposure to rodent or dog urine–contaminated freshwater; for example, through recreational water sports, flooding, or occupation. After an incubation period of 7 to 12 days, patients classically present with a biphasic illness: a bacteremic phase with flulike symptoms lasting 4 to 7 days, followed 1 to 3 days later by an immune phase of fever, myalgia, hepatorenal syndrome, and hemorrhage.[22](#page-9-6) The severe end of the spectrum, Weil's disease, occurs infrequently but has a case fatality rate of 10% to 15%. Gastrointestinal and respiratory presentations and meningitis, myocarditis, and pancreatitis are occasionally described.

**Fig. 150.3** Patient returned 1 month previously from a 2-week holiday in Thailand. Two days prior to presentation, he developed fever, headache, and rash. On further questioning, he reported having unprotected sexual intercourse during his holiday. Diagnosis: secondary syphilis.

# <span id="page-3-1"></span>Amebic Liver Abscess

Amebic liver absces[s23](#page-9-7) should be considered in all patients with fever and a raised right hemi-diaphragm on chest radiography. It has a higher prevalence in developing countries. Travelers, exposed through fecal–oral transmission, will often present weeks to months after return (incubation period: 8–20 weeks). Most patients report fever, often localized abdominal pain, and hepatomegaly. Only 20% give a history of dysentery, and only 10% have diarrhea at presentation.

#### Brucellosis

Brucellosi[s24](#page-9-8) is acquired through ingestion of unpasteurized milk, although transmission can occur after direct contact with animal parts or, in laboratories, through inhalation of aerosolized particles. It has a global distribution, with a higher prevalence in the Middle East, Balkans, former USSR, the Mediterranean, and South America. Symptoms develop 2 to 4 weeks after exposure (up to 6 months) and vary from an acute febrile illness to a chronic low-grade relapsing fever; signs include lymphadenopathy, hepatomegaly, and splenomegaly. Complications of brucellosis are common—in particular, large-joint septic arthritis, sacroiliitis, and, less commonly, spondylitis of the lumbar spine. Other complications include epididymo-orchitis, septic abortion, neurologic involvement (meningitis, encephalitis, and abscess), and endocarditis.

#### Q Fever (*Coxiella burnetii* )

Q feve[r25](#page-9-9) is rarer than brucellosis, although it has a similar clinical history. It has a global distribution, with most cases related to occupational exposure, usually through inhalation of aerosolized particles. Community outbreaks, as reported in the Netherlands in 2008, occur.[26](#page-9-10) Most cases are asymptomatic; symptomatic patients present with fever, pneumonia, or hepatitis after exposure to farms or animals. Complications, including chronic infection, are well described, particularly endocarditis.

#### HIV and Other STIs

Between 5% and 51% of short-term travelers take part in casual sex while abroad, with higher rates reported in long-term travelers.[27](#page-9-11) Many STIs present as a febrile illness, including HIV seroconversion, secondary syphilis ([Fig. 150.3](#page-3-1)), and gonorrhea. People living

### **Respiratory Tract Infections**

Respiratory tract infections are diagnosed as the underlying cause of febrile illness in 7% to 24% of returning travelers.[4](#page-8-3) These include sinusitis, pharyngitis, tonsillitis, bronchitis, influenza, pneumonia, and pulmonary eosinophilia. Influenza is the most common vaccine-preventable infection acquired by travelers. The following are clinical and epidemiologic associations (see diseasespecific chapters for details).

#### Upper Respiratory Tract Infections

• Diphtheria: Patients with severe pharyngitis on return from the Indian subcontinent, Southeast Asia, Haiti, or South America.

#### Lower Respiratory Tract Infections

- • Middle Eastern Respiratory Syndrome (MERS), caused by a coronavirus, is a severe acute respiratory illness. Nosocomial transmission is well documented, so strict respiratory precautions must be initiated. Camels are known to be the reservoir[.29](#page-9-13)
- • Histoplasmosis or coccidioidomycosis: Exposure to damp conditions (e.g., bat-occupied caves) or dusty conditions, respectively. Coccidioidomycosis is restricted to certain areas in the Americas.
- • Legionella: Exposure to air conditioning or other aerosolized water sources in cruise ships or hotels.
- • Melioidosis (*Burkholderia pseudomallei*): Febrile patients from Southeast Asia with upper lung zone infiltrates or cavitation on chest radiography or septicemia.
- • Q fever: Fever, pneumonia, or hepatitis after exposure to farms or animals.
- • Tuberculosis: Travel to areas of high endemicity, particularly among VFRs, long-stay travelers, health care workers, and the immune compromised; symptomatic primary infection is uncommon.[30](#page-9-14)

• Fever, respiratory symptoms, and peripheral eosinophilia: Consider Loeffler's syndrome (*Ascaris,* hookworm, *Strongyloides*), acute schistosomiasis, tropical pulmonary eosinophilia (filaria), leaking hydatid cyst, visceral larva migrans, and paragonimiasis.[31](#page-9-15)

#### **Gastrointestinal Infections**

# Diarrhea

Travelers' diarrhea has a reported incidence of at least 200 cases/1000 ill returned travelers.[3](#page-8-2) Fever is self-reported in one third of these patients. Specific pathogens vary according to destination, setting, and season; however, enteric bacteria, including *Escherichia coli, Campylobacter, Salmonella,* and *Shigella,* are the most common. In up to 50%, no pathogen is identified. The combination of fever and bloody diarrhea is suggestive of bacterial or amebic dysentery, with the latter (uncommon in the returning traveler) often having a more indolent onset. Empiric antibiotics can be considered (see later). Any systemic febrile infection can have diarrhea at presentation; for example, severe sepsis, malaria, and pneumococcal pneumonia.

#### Abdominal Pain

Enteric fever, amebic liver abscess, viral hepatitis, and, rarely, leaking or secondarily infected hydatid cysts can cause fever and abdominal pain.

#### Jaundice

Infections presenting with fever and jaundice are listed in [Table](#page-4-1) [150.3](#page-4-1).

#### **Neurologic Infections**

Neurologic presentations, including meningitis and encephalitis, are reported in 15/1000 ill returned travelers.[3](#page-8-2) Cerebral malaria can present with encephalopathy, meningismus, seizures, or focal signs and should always be excluded.

#### Meningitis

Typical bacterial and viral causes should be considered. Causes of predominantly lymphocytic meningitis include arboviruses, brucellosis, leptospirosis, Lyme disease, Q fever, relapsing fevers, syphilis, tuberculosis, HIV seroconversion, and HIV-related opportunistic infections (e.g., cryptococcal meningitis). Some infections, such as enteric fever, rarely present with meningismus but the cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) is normal.

#### Encephalitis

In addition to typical causes of encephalitis, travel-related causes are arboviruses (e.g., West Nile virus, Japanese encephalitis, tickborne encephalitis), brucellosis, rabies, rickettsial infections, African trypanosomiasis, and tuberculosis. African trypanosomiasis (sleeping sickness) has been described in travelers returning from game parks in East and Central Africa, including Tanzania, Malawi, and Zambia.

# **PATIENT EVALUATION, DIAGNOSIS, AND DIFFERENTIAL DIAGNOSIS**

It is necessary to understand the epidemiology of specific pathogens and to obtain the travel history, including geographic destinations visited, dates of risk exposures, time of onset, and duration of

symptoms.[4](#page-8-3) The geography of exposure helps determine which infections the traveler may have been exposed to, and illness onset and symptoms help to estimate the incubation period (see [Tables](#page-1-0) [150.1](#page-1-0) and [150.2](#page-2-0)).

Many infections have similar clinical presentations; however, certain symptoms and signs can give clues; relevant examination findings include rash, eschar, hepatosplenomegaly, and jaundice ([Tables 150.3, 150.4, and 150.5](#page-4-1)). [Table 150.6](#page-5-1) lists the differential diagnosis in patients with chronic fever (>2 weeks) and is a reminder that non-infectious causes are seen in this group.

Travelers presenting with undifferentiated fever should have initial investigations [\(Table 150.7\)](#page-6-1); following these, specific studies may be appropriate, depending on the differential diagnosis [\(Table](#page-6-0)

[150.8](#page-6-0)). When tuberculosis is considered, it is essential that adequate samples of sputum or tissue for mycobacteria culture are obtained. Tuberculin skin tests and interferon-gamma release assays have a limited role in evaluation of patients with chronic fever.

Rarely, fever may be due to a viral hemorrhagic fever such as Lassa, Ebola, Marburg, or Crimean-Congo hemorrhagic fever. The diagnosis should be considered in travelers who have visited endemic regions within 21 days of symptom onset,[32,33](#page-9-16) in particular, travel to rural areas of sub-Saharan Africa (particularly west and

This table applies to patients in whom malaria has been excluded.

central Africa); contact with suspected cases, health care facilities, rats, or wild animals raises the index of suspicion. Symptoms and signs vary according to pathogen, with bleeding in advanced cases. These infections can be severe and have implications for nosocomial transmission. Diagnosis is by polymerase chain reaction (PCR) of blood, which should be performed prior to further investigations (which might result in exposure of health care staff); malaria must be excluded. A high index of suspicion, close liaison with specialists, and transfer to a specialist facility are usually necessary to manage these patients.

One diagnostic strategy is to perform a standard "geographic panel" of diagnostic tests, based purely on the travel history, in all febrile patients in whom malaria has been excluded. This approach may reduce the likelihood that less common diagnoses are missed if a clinician does not consider them, but may also increase testing costs.

#### **TREATMENT**

The relevant chapters should be consulted for detailed advice on the treatment of individual infections. Presumptive treatment may sometimes be started (see [Table 150.8](#page-6-0)).[4](#page-8-3)

#### **Malaria**

Parasitic confirmation (smears, rapid diagnostic tests [RDTs], or PCR) of suspected malaria is preferred, and empiric treatment is not recommended in clinical settings with good diagnostic facilities. However, diagnostic results must be accurate, timely, and available. Accuracy depends on the skills of the microscopist; RDT and PCR results reflect the performance characteristics of the assay. RDTs have high sensitivity for *P. falciparum* but can be lower for non-falciparum malaria. Presumptive treatment is not recommended, and facilities managing returning travelers should ensure an accurate diagnostic test result can be obtained within 6 hours.

# **Amebic Liver Abscess**

Metronidazole 750 mg three times daily for 7 to 10 days or tinidazole 2 g daily for 3 days should be started empirically in patients with an appropriate travel history, clinical presentation, imaging, and, where available, serology (can be falsely negative in early disease). Most patients demonstrate clinical improvement and resolution of fever within 48 to 72 hours. The main differential diagnosis is a pyogenic liver abscess; patients with sepsis require broad-spectrum antibiotics until the diagnosis is confirmed. Surgical or percutaneous drainage is rarely required and should only be considered if there is diagnostic uncertainty, symptoms persist after 4 days of treatment, or there is imminent risk of rupture into critical sites (e.g., left-lobe abscess rupturing into the pericardium).[34](#page-9-17) After treatment, patients should be given 10 days of a luminal amebicide to prevent relapse: diloxanide furoate (500 mg orally three times daily) or paromomycin (30 mg/kg orally in three divided doses).

# **Enteric Fever**

When there is a strong suspicion, a parenteral third-generation cephalosporin (e.g., ceftriaxone) can be commenced pending blood culture results. Fluoroquinolone-resistant isolates are reported in patients returning from Asia, but so far have been rarely reported in those returning from Africa[.35](#page-9-18) Ciprofloxacin 750 mg twice daily remains the treatment of choice for fully sensitive isolates. Azithromycin 1 g followed by 500 mg daily should be used as follow-on therapy where fluoroquinolone resistance is suspected or confirmed. Regardless of which antibiotic is used, fever can take time to resolve; failure to defervesce is not a reason to change antibiotics when the isolate is confirmed as sensitive.

# **Leptospirosis**

Due to the potential severity of the illness, the non-specific nature of initial investigations, and a minimum period of 6 to 10 days before confirmatory serology becomes available, a 5- to 7-day course of penicillin (benzylpenicillin 1.5 million units four times daily) or doxycycline (100 mg twice daily) should be considered in patients with a flulike illness within 7 to 12 days of freshwater exposure.

# **Rickettsiae**

Fever and headache, with or without rash, developing within 10 days of exposure to ticks in southern African game parks should prompt treatment with doxycycline 100 mg twice daily while other infections are excluded. A response is expected within 24 to 48 hours.

# **Acute Schistosomiasis**

Empiric treatment should be offered to travelers presenting with fever, urticarial rash, and eosinophilia (>0.45 × 109 /L) within 4 to 8 weeks of freshwater exposure[.31](#page-9-15) Praziquantel 40 mg/kg in a divided dose 4 hours apart will kill mature, but not immature, schistosomes (*Schistosoma japonicum:* 60 mg/kg in three divided doses). Treatment should therefore be given at the time of diagnosis but repeated 6 to 8 weeks later. Corticosteroids can help alleviate acute symptoms.

#### **Bacterial Sepsis**

International travel, particularly to India, the Middle East, and Africa, is associated with an increased risk of acquiring extendedspectrum β-lactamase–producing gram-negative pathogens[.36](#page-9-19) This should be taken into account when empiric antibiotics are indicated.
