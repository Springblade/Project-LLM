# Escherichia coli Diarrhea

Luis Cabrera-Sosa, Theresa J. Ochoa

#### **KEY FEATURES**

- There are six classic diarrheagenic *E. coli* (DEC) pathotypes: enteropathogenic (EPEC), shiga toxin-producing (STEC), enteroaggregative (EAEC), enterotoxigenic (ETEC), enteroinvasive (EIEC), and diffusely adherent *E. coli* (DAEC), and a newly recognized pathotype: adherent invasive *E. coli* (AIEC).
- DEC strains are responsible for 30% to 40% of diarrhea episodes in children in developing countries. The most common pathotypes in children are EAEC, EPEC, and ETEC
- In adults with traveler's diarrhea, the main DEC pathotypes are ETEC and EAEC.
- All DEC strains produce watery, self-limited diarrhea. STEC and EIEC are associated with bloody diarrhea, whereas EAEC, EPEC, and AIEC could produce prolonged or persistent diarrhea.
- STEC infection could induce hemolytic uremic syndrome (HUS). Children with STEC infection have bloody diarrhea, usually without fever. Antibiotics should not be used because they increase the risk of developing HUS.
- AIEC is associated with Crohn's disease.
- Diagnosis of DEC is mainly done by the detection of specific virulence genes by polymerase chain reaction (PCR) or other molecular methods. STEC could be diagnosed by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) or other immunologic methods.
- Hygiene, breastfeeding, and oral rehydration are recommended for DEC prevention and management. There are no effective vaccines against DEC.

#### INTRODUCTION

Escherichia coli are gram-negative bacteria that grow in the gastrointestinal tract as commensals. However, they can also cause extra-intestinal infections, such as urinary tract infections (UTIs), sepsis, and meningitis, or intestinal infections. Diarrheagenic E. coli are those that can cause diarrhea, mainly in children under 5 years of age. They can be classified according to clinical criteria and pathophysiology. Classically, six groups are described: enteropathogenic E. coli (EPEC), shiga toxin–producing E. coli (STEC), enteroaggregative E. coli (EAEC), enterotoxigenic E. coli (ETEC), enteroinvasive E. coli (EIEC), and diffusely adherent E. coli (DAEC). Acceptable 2. coli (AIEC) (Table 46.1).

# EPIDEMIOLOGY, CLINICAL MANIFESTATIONS, AND PATHOGENESIS

In general, DEC strains are responsible for 30% to 40% of all diarrhea cases in children in developing countries. The most common pathotypes in children are EAEC, EPEC, and ETEC.

In adults with traveler's diarrhea, the main DEC pathotypes are ETEC and EAEC. From a public health perspective, STEC is the most important pathogen because of its association with hemolytic uremic syndrome (HUS).

#### Enteropathogenic *E. coli*

EPEC was the first identified DEC. It is an important cause of infant diarrhea (predominantly in children under 2 years) in developing countries. Diarrhea caused by EPEC is mostly subclinical and acute, but may be moderate, severe, or persistent; lead to malnutrition; and can cause death, particularly in children under 12 months.<sup>5</sup> Fever, malaise, and vomiting are other common symptoms. With a large inoculum, EPEC may induce diarrhea after 12 to 24 hours. The distinctive characteristic of EPEC is its ability to produce an "attaching and effacing" (A/E) lesion in the enterocytes. The A/E lesion is originated by a tight attachment between the bacterium and the enterocyte, microvillus effacement, and accumulation of actin, forming a pedestal-like structure. EPEC has a pathogenicity island called the locus of enterocyte effacement (LEE), with type III secretion system (T3SS)-encoding genes. The T3SS injects enterotoxins (EspA-B-D) and other effector proteins into the enterocyte's cytoplasm. The LEE also encodes intimin (eae gene), an adhesin that mediates the intimate attachment, and its receptor, Tir, which is translocated into the enterocyte's membrane. Some EPEC strains, called typical EPEC (tEPEC), carry the E. coli adherence factor (EAF) plasmid, which encodes the IV bundle-forming pilus (BFP) and the plasmid-encoded regulator (Per, a transcriptional activator). Atypical EPEC strains (aEPEC) are bfp (-) (do not encode BFP), less genetically homogeneous than tEPEC strains, and more frequently detected in control and asymptomatic patients.7 tEPEC displays localized adherence patterns (Fig. 46.1), whereas aEPEC can produce other adherence patterns. The mechanism of how EPEC causes diarrhea is not well understood.4,6

#### Shiga Toxin-Producing *E. coli*

STEC, also referred as verotoxin-producing E. coli (VTEC) or enterohemorrhagic E. coli (EHEC), are E. coli strains that produce shiga toxins (Stx). STEC causes diarrhea in all age groups. Approximately 2,801,000 acute illnesses are estimated annually worldwide. Ruminants are the main STEC reservoir. STEC has a low infectious dose (50-100 colony-forming units [CFU]) and a short incubation period (3–4 days). STEC infection is characterized by abdominal cramps and bloody diarrhea, usually without fever. 10 Approximately 5% to 10% of children infected with STEC develop HUS, characterized by acute renal failure, thrombocytopenia, and microangiopathic hemolytic anemia. 911 STEC strains associated with disease in humans are called *EHEC*; the most common EHEC serotype is O157:H7, which is the predominant cause of HUS.<sup>10</sup> The Stx are composed of an A subunit and five B subunits. The A subunit inhibits protein synthesis by its RNA N-glycosidase activity and induces apoptosis. The B subunitpentamer binds to globotriaosylceramide-3 (Gb3) on the enterocyte. There are two types of Stx: Stx1 and Stx2. Both toxins are released through lambdoid phage-mediated lysis, which is induced by antibiotics. 11 Similar to EPEC, some STEC strains have the LEE plasmid, but it is not essential for pathogenesis. It is not well

<span id="page-1-1"></span>understood how STEC produces diarrhea.[10](#page-3-8) The 2011 German outbreak was caused by an O104:H14 strain that simultaneously produced Stx and some virulence factors of EAEC; it was called *enteroaggregative hemorrhagic* E. coli *(EAHEC).* This strain caused nearly 4000 cases of hemorrhagic colitis, more than 800 cases of HUS, and at least 50 deaths[.12](#page-3-10)

## **Enteroaggregative** *E. coli*

EAEC can produce a variety of clinical manifestations. It is associated with acute diarrhea in children; is the second most common cause of travelers' diarrhea; can produce acute and persistent diarrhea in HIV-infected patients; and can cause persistent diarrhea in malnourished children, mainly in children under 1 year of age in developing countries[.13](#page-3-11) In addition, EAEC is frequently isolated from asymptomatic patients[.14](#page-3-12) Diarrhea by EAEC is characterized by abdominal pain, nausea, vomiting, fever, watery stools, or blood or mucus in the stool.[15](#page-3-13) Although the inoculum dose is high (1010 CFU) for adults, it is unknown for children; the incubation period is 8 to 52 hours[.14](#page-3-12) EAEC are a heterogeneous group of pathogens characterized for their aggregative adhesion phenotype or "stackedbrick" pattern in HEp-2 cells ([Fig. 46.2](#page-1-3)), mediated by the aggregative adherence plasmids (pAA)[.16](#page-3-14) The pathogenesis of EAEC

<span id="page-1-3"></span>involves three steps: adherence to mucosal surface, biofilm formation, and release of toxins with inflammatory induction activity. The adhesion is mediated by the aggregative adherence fimbriae (AAF), which are encoded by the pAA plasmids. An important transcriptional activator for AAF and dispersin is *aggR,* but there are EAEC strains lacking this gene.[14,15](#page-3-12) Many factors are involved in biofilm formation, including AFF and *aggR* expression. The biofilm occurs mainly in the colon.[14](#page-3-12) EAEC can produce a variety of toxins, including EAST1 (EAEC heat-stable enterotoxin), which increases secretion of chloride; *Shigella* enterotoxin-1 (ShET1), which causes fluid accumulation; hemolysin E (HlyE), a poreforming toxin; and serine protease autotransporters of Enterobacteriaceae (SPATE), including plasmid-encoded toxin (Pet), a protein involved in intestinal colonization (Pic), and *Shigella* extracellular protease (SepA)[.14](#page-3-12)

## **Enterotoxigenic** *E. coli*

ETEC is an important cause of diarrhea in all ages. It is a common cause of infant diarrhea in developing countries, is the most common cause of traveler's diarrhea, and can be associated with diarrhea outbreaks caused by natural disasters in developing countries[.5,17](#page-3-3) Worldwide, more than 200 million ETEC diarrhea cases and between 50,000 and 90,000 deaths are estimated.[18](#page-3-15) In the GEMS study (Global Enteric Multicenter Study), ST-ETEC strains were associated with increased risk of death in moderate

and severe diarrhea[.5](#page-3-3) Watery self-limiting diarrhea with fever, abdominal cramps, nausea, and vomiting is distinctive of ETEC diarrhea. The infectious dose ranges between 106 and 108 CFU, and the incubation time is 1 to 2 days. ETEC secretes two major toxins: heat-labile (LT) and heat-stable (ST) enterotoxins, both encoded in plasmids. Other secreted toxins are EatA, EAST1, and CxeE[.1](#page-3-0) LT is an AB5 toxin with homology with choleric toxin; it binds to the GM1 ganglioside and increases the level of cyclic adenosine monophosphate (cAMP). ST is a non-antigenic polypeptide with no amino acid similarity with LT; it binds to the guanylyl cyclase receptor and increases the level of cyclic guanosine monophosphate (cGMP). The increase of cAMP and cGMP produce an elevated secretion of Cl and HCO3 to the lumen, causing the characteristic watery diarrhea.[16](#page-3-14) Before toxin secretion, ETEC colonizes the intestine by colonization factors (CF) and other non-fimbrial adhesins such as Tia, TibA, and EtpA[.4](#page-3-2) To date, more than 26 CF types have been identified; however, 30% to 50% of ETEC strains have no characterized CF. Worldwide, the most common CFs are CFA/I, CFA/II, and CFA/IV[.19](#page-3-16)

## **Enteroinvasive** *E. coli*

EIEC can cause diarrhea in children and adults in developing countries, and can cause outbreaks in developed countries. However, very few epidemiologic studies have been done to estimate its burden[.20](#page-3-17) It can produce dysentery-like illness or watery diarrhea; other symptoms include fatigue, malaise, fever, anorexia, abdominal cramps, tenesmus, scanty stools with blood and mucus, and dehydration[.1](#page-3-0) The inoculum dose is 106 CFU, and the incubation time is 24 hours[.20,21](#page-3-17) EIEC is biochemically very similar to *Shigella.* Both have the virulence plasmid VP, which confers the ability to invade the enterocytes. The VP plasmid encodes a T3SS; the proteins expressed by this system, namely translocators IpaB, IpaC, and IpaD, are essential for invasiveness.[20](#page-3-17) The bacteria penetrates the epithelial barrier by transcytosis through M cells. Once there, macrophages take up the bacteria; then they evade their degradation and invade the basolateral surface of intestinal epithelial cells by endocytosis. The bacteria promote their uptake into the phagosome. After escaping, EIEC can spread across the cells mediated by the effector proteins VirA and VirG. EIEC can destroy the epithelium by the inflammatory response induced upon invasion.[21](#page-3-18)

## **Diffusely Adherent** *E. coli*

DAEC is associated with diarrhea in children between 1 and 5 years old in developing and developed countries; it is implicated in UTIs and pregnancy complications, and can be isolated from asymptomatic children and adults.[22](#page-3-19) Diarrhea caused by DAEC is watery and can become persistent in young children.[3](#page-3-20) Although DAEC strains are very heterogeneous, the diffuse adherence (DA) pattern in HEp-2 or HeLa cells [\(Fig. 46.3](#page-2-0)) is a distinctive characteristic of all of them. This adherence is mediated by fimbrial (i.e., Dr) and afimbrial (Afa) adhesins, called *Afa/Dr adhesins.* These adhesins can interact with decay-accelerating factor (DAF) as receptors, which results in damage of microvilli by disorganization of the cytoskeleton. In addition, some adhesins can bind to carcinoembryonic antigen-related molecules (CEACAM), which lead to CEACAM aggregation and effacement of microvilli[.16,22](#page-3-14) Some DAEC strains do not produce Ada/Dr adhesins; instead, they encode an adhesin involved in diffuse adherence (AIDA-I) and are called *atypical DAEC.* DAEC can also cause a proinflammatory effect[.22](#page-3-19)

# **Adherent Invasive** *E. coli*

AIEC is a novel DEC pathotype implicated in ileal Crohn's disease; it is present in approximately 36% of cases. However, it can also be found in healthy people; therefore it is considered

<span id="page-2-0"></span>a pathobiont[.23,24](#page-3-21) AIEC strains are defined as *E. coli* strains that can adhere to Caco-2 or I-407 cells, invade I-407 cells, induce actin polymerization, and replicate within J774-A1 macrophages[.24](#page-3-22) AIEC do not have known virulent determinants; studies in the reference AEIC strain LF82 found no specific genes that can explain its characteristics.[23](#page-3-21) AIEC can adhere to CEACAM6 in the ileum, so mutations related to Crohn's disease can predispose patients to infection by AIEC; AIEC can also up-regulate CEACAM6 by itself.[25](#page-4-0) For its invasion to the epithelium, AIEC enters M cells by macropinocytosis and then is taken up by macrophages. After invasion, AIEC can reduce epithelial barrier function[.25](#page-4-0)

## **DIAGNOSIS**

Clinical and biochemical features can barely help to distinguish among the DEC pathotypes. Some O157:H7 STEC strains can be identified by culturing in MacConkey–Sorbitol agar because they are unable to ferment sorbitol. Despite their genetic similarity, some biochemical assays can be used to discriminate between EIEC and *Shigella*.

The HEp2 cell adherence assay can be used to identify EPEC, EAEC, and DAEC, based on their distinctive adherence pattern: localized or localized-like, aggregative ("stacked-brick"), and diffuse pattern, respectively [\(Figs. 46.1–46.3](#page-1-1)). For EAEC, this assay is considered the gold standard for its identification.[14](#page-3-12) The standard gentamicin protection assay, which evaluates the ability to invade cells and replicate within macrophages, is the only test for AIEC detection because there is no specific gene associated with this pathotype[.24](#page-3-22)

Some toxins and antigens can be detected by immunologic assays: for example, latex agglutination assay for O157 and H7 antigens, monosialoganglioside GM1 enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) for LT and ST, and commercial enzyme immunoassay (EIA) kits for Stx1 and Stx2, which is the preferred method for STEC detection because they can detect non-O157:H7 STEC strains. For the latter, the Centers for Disease Control (CDC) recommends these tests in all bloody stool samples from communityacquired diarrhea; however, it is not implemented in all.[1](#page-3-0)

Nowadays, molecular methods are preferred due to their high sensitivity and specificity and because they are less laborious and time consuming than traditional methods. The most utilized are the polymerase chain reaction (PCR)–based methods, both conventional and real time. For differentiating DEC pathotypes, many specific targets have been evaluated (see [Table 46.1](#page-1-0)). The simultaneous detection of many virulence genes for one pathotype can increase the sensitivity of the assay.

Some molecular diagnostic platforms are cleared by the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) for diagnosis of several gastrointestinal pathogens, including DEC (i.e., FilmArray GI panel). The problem with these panels is that they detect more co-infections than common PCR-based methods, even in samples from asymptomatic patients. Their high cost limits their use to reference and research laboratories[.26](#page-4-1)

Some studies have highlighted the need of not only detecting virulence genes, but also determining the bacterial load in the stool, mainly to distinguish between diarrhea and asymptomatic colonization[.27](#page-4-2) For this reason, quantitative PCR systems are recommended and used in many studies. In the GEMS study, for example, ST-ETEC and EIEC/*Shigella* had higher quantities associated with diarrhea cases.[28](#page-4-3)

Recently some isothermal amplification diagnostic methods have been developed, such as the loop-mediated isothermal amplification (LAMP) and the recombinase polymerase amplification (RPA). Because they avoid the use of thermocyclers, they have the potential to be used at the point of care. To date, LAMP assays for all DEC pathotypes, except DAEC, have been developed, whereas, only an RPA assay for STEC is reported[.29,30](#page-4-4)

## **TREATMENT**

Because dehydration is the main complication of diarrhea, adequate fluid management, including oral rehydration solutions (ORS), should be used in all children with diarrhea. It is also recommended to continue breastfeeding and start foods, if applicable, as soon as possible.[31](#page-4-5)

Except for traveler's and persistent diarrhea, antibiotics are not commonly used for DEC diarrhea. For children, there is no recommendation for antibiotic use because efficacy trials are lacking. For ETEC and EAEC, fluoroquinolones, azithromycin, rifaximin, amoxicillin/clavulanic acid, and nalidixic acid can be used in traveler's diarrhea in adults.[32](#page-4-6)

Many studies have reported antibiotic resistance in DEC strains, both from symptomatic and asymptomatic patients. This is an increasing worldwide problem. Of special interest is the increased rate of extended-spectrum β-lactamases (ESBL)–producing strains, especially the bla*CTX-M* genotype, in developing countries, because they have been associated with high morbidity and mortality.[33](#page-4-7)

Treatment of STEC is particularly difficult because it is known that antibiotics can induce Stx production. A recent systematic review found that antibiotic use was significantly associated with an increased risk of developing HUS[.34](#page-4-8) Another study found that the lack of intravenous fluid administration and a high hematocrit value before the development of HUS were associated with poor outcome in infected children.[35](#page-4-9) Therefore fluid administration in STEC infections should be recommended to reduce HUS morbidity. Treatment of HUS is supportive; many children require early dialysis.

## **PREVENTION**

As for all gastrointestinal diseases, food and personal hygiene, water quality, and sanitation are critical for the prevention of diarrhea, especially in developing countries.[36](#page-4-10) Breastfeeding has been proposed as the most cost-effective intervention for protecting children against diarrhea.[37](#page-4-11) In developing countries, lack of breastfeeding in infants less than 6 months of age is associated with 160% increase in diarrhea incidence and 950% increase in diarrhea mortality[.38](#page-4-12) Breast milk protects infants due to the presence of several bioactive components such as lactoferrin, oligosaccharides, and secretory immunoglobulins.[39](#page-4-13)

The development of vaccines against DEC could assist with diarrhea control, but to date, no effective vaccines are available. Many ETEC vaccines are being developed; however, their efficacy in children in developing countries is limited. The cholera vaccine Dukoral has been recommended for prevention of traveler's diarrhea due to ETEC; however, the evidence is insufficient[.40](#page-4-14) Vaccination of children and cattle has been proposed for STEC prevention. Two STEC vaccines (Econiche and Epitopix) have been developed, but they only target O157:H7 strains. In general, immune response to DEC strains is not fully understood, making vaccine design challenging[.40](#page-4-14)
