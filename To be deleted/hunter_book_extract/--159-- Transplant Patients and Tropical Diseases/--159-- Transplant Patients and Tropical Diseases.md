# **159** Transplant Patients and Tropical Diseases

*Elham Rahmati, Maria del Castillo, Neha Nanda*

## KEY FEATURES

- • "Travel for transplantation" differs from "transplant tourism," which is driven by commercialism and is associated with greater risk of infection and lower graft survival rates.
- • Solid organ transplant (SOT) recipients are less immunocompromised than stem cell transplant (SCT) recipients. The resulting disparities in quality of life and medical problems after transplantation can lead to acquisition of tropical infections during travel.
- • Exposure to tropical pathogens depends on the geography of travel; presenting clinical syndromes are often atypical, because immunosuppression can alter the pathogenesis.
- • Malaria predominates among tropical pathogens in transplant recipients.
- • Toxoplasmosis can manifest as asymptomatic parasitemia or disseminated disease in transplant recipients. Heart transplant recipients are at a high risk for toxoplasmosis.
- • *Strongyloides stercoralis* is an uncommon entity among transplant recipients; however, if unrecognized, the disease can be fatal.
- • Chagas and leishmaniasis are other tropical diseases in transplant recipients.

#### **INTRODUCTION**

International travel and transplantation can lead to acquisition of tropical diseases. These include infections related to trafficked organs, those acquired during transplantation, and infections in transplant recipients who are on immunosuppressive agents.

#### **TRANSPLANT TOURISM**

The Istanbul Declaration on Organ Trafficking and Transplant Tourism (2008) provides useful guidance. The declaration distinguishes between "travel for transplantation" and "transplant tourism." When organs, donors, recipients, or professionals move across jurisdictional borders, it is designated as travel for transplantation, which may be justified. When organ trafficking, commercialism, and diversion of resources undermine the ability of a host country to provide transplant services for its own population, it becomes unethical transplant tourism [\(Table 159.1\)](#page-0-0).[1,2](#page-3-0) The declaration gives strategies to prevent such practices by increasing the deceased donor pool through removing obstacles for donation and implementing national legislations for transplantation programs. In 2010 the World Health Organization (WHO) urged its members to implement policies and legislation regarding human tissue donation and transplantation in order to promote a voluntary, non-remunerated process and understanding of the risks caused by trafficking organs[.3](#page-3-1) Despite the Istanbul Declaration and efforts of the WHO to curtail unethical practices, risks for donors and recipients persist.

Organ trafficking and transplant tourism account for about 10% of annual organ transplants worldwide. This provides ample opportunity for the acquisition of tropical disease and reactivation of latent infections from donated organs[.1](#page-3-0)

In 2016, a total of 33,611 solid organ transplants (SOTs) were performed in the United States, a 20% increase over the previous 5 years. The most commonly transplanted organ is kidney, followed by liver. The pool of potential recipients has increased rapidly, while the organs available for transplant lag behind. There are organs for only 3% of the potential recipients, that is, 118,028 patients waiting for organ transplantation and only 3946 donors available.[4](#page-3-2)

Due to the disparity between the number of individuals awaiting organ transplantation and that of eligible donors, certain patients may seek options for transplantation outside of their home countries, and specifically, in tropical areas in which endemic diseases pose risks to the immunosuppressed host. China is a popular destination visited by potential transplantation recipients[.5](#page-3-3)

At the University of California at Los Angeles, 17 of 33 (52%) recipients who received an organ from another country experienced post-transplant infections.[2](#page-3-4) One recipient acquired hepatitis B and died of multi-organ failure[.6](#page-3-5) Stem cell transplants (SCTs) in medical tourists have resulted in meningitis after transplantation in China.[7](#page-3-6) Additionally, graft survival rates are lower and infection rates are generally higher among transplant tourists.

Some individuals undergoing transplantation in tropical regions are doing so as a result of illegal organ trafficking, making clinical information on these cases difficult to obtain and highly unreliable. For this reason, this chapter focuses on travelers who have undergone transplantation under ideal circumstances who subsequently visit areas where tropical diseases are endemic, in particular, how such travelers on immunosuppressive agents fare and how tropical infections can become more pathogenic and clinically unrecognizable in these settings.

#### **DEGREES OF IMMUNOSUPPRESSION**

In the last 20 years, agents have been introduced for induction and maintenance of immunosuppression in the transplanted population. Induction therapy is intense treatment administered at the time of transplantation to reduce the risk of acute rejection.

Induction strategies include conventional immunosuppressive agents and/or the use of antibodies directed against T-cell antigens, such as anti-thymocyte globulin and/or total body radiation in the case of bone marrow transplants. Maintenance immunotherapy is less potent and is used to prevent acute and late rejection of the transplanted organ ([Table 159.2](#page-1-0)).[8–10](#page-3-7)

With these treatments, the rate of graft survival and quality of life (QOL) after transplantation has significantly improved. Data show an impressive increase in 1-year allograft survival after kidney transplantation.[11](#page-3-8) Also, mental QOL improves after allogeneic bone marrow transplant and is comparable to the general population.[12](#page-3-9)

SCT recipients are the most immunosuppressed. As a result of conditioning therapy and graft-versus-host disease (GVHD), cutaneous and mucosal breakdown, neutropenia, lymphopenia, and hypogammaglobinemia, a loss of immune memory may occur. After engraftment, SCT recipients inherit their donor's hematopoietic profile. On the other hand, SOT recipients are less immunocompromised. Kidney transplant recipients require relatively minimal immunosuppression, liver and heart transplant recipients require moderate amounts, and those who undergo small bowel and lung transplantation require higher levels.

The types of infections that are seen in those who have received SOT and those who have received SCT are detailed in [Tables](#page-1-1) [159.3](#page-1-1) and [159.4](#page-2-0).

#### **DISEASE DISTRIBUTION IN RETURNING TRAVELERS**

In a cross-sectional survey of 2554 SOT recipients at the Mayo Clinic, 27% of the recipients reported travel outside of the United States and Canada after their transplant.[13](#page-3-10) Ninety-six percent of the travelers did not seek medical care before travel; 8% required medical attention due to illness. Pre-travel counseling and vaccination can help reduce morbidity in this population. Generally, SOT recipients are urged to delay travel for 3 to 6 months after transplant[.14,15](#page-3-11)

In 516 patients at Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center, international travel, mainly to low-risk destinations, was common among SCT recipients within 2 years of transplantation[.16](#page-3-12) However, 28% of the patients traveled to destinations that required vaccinations or malaria chemoprophylaxis, and only 56% of these sought pre-travel health advice. Only 16 patients (7%) developed illness after traveling that required medical attention. Travelers who fell ill were more likely to have traveled to Central and South America, Africa, the Middle East, and South and Southeast Asia; experienced longer trip durations; and visited family and relatives[.16](#page-3-12)

#### **MALARIA IN STEM CELL AND SOLID ORGAN TRANSPLANT RECIPIENTS**

Malaria is the most common tropical disease acquired abroad in all travelers returning with febrile illness from endemic areas; transplant recipients are no exception. Malaria should also be considered in transplant recipients whose donors were from endemic areas. In a comprehensive review of parasitic infections in transplant recipients, the majority of the malaria cases were attributed to the allografts (77.5%), whereas the remaining cases were due to blood transfusions, mosquito bites, or unclear sources[.17](#page-3-13)

Immunocompromised hosts can present with atypical symptoms and lack the classic cyclic temperature patterns of malaria[.17,18](#page-3-13)

*Plasmodium falciparum* carries the highest risk of severe disease. Initial diagnosis relies on blood smear or rapid diagnostic test. Screening of donors who have visited endemic areas before organ donation is suggested. Treatment does not change in transplant patients, with the caveat that anti-malarial medications interact with some immunosuppressants[.17–20](#page-3-13) Preventive measures such as chemoprophylaxis before visiting endemic areas and strict avoidance of mosquito bites is crucial.

There are only a handful of possible donor-derived cases of malaria among SCT: three cases of *P. vivax* and one case of *P. falciparum.*[21–24](#page-3-14) The majority of donor-derived malaria cases among SOT recipients are in renal transplants. Most cases had favorable outcomes. This is possibly due to the long cold preservation time of the kidneys, resulting in lower burden of parasites transmitted, in addition to the lower immunosuppression required in renal transplants.[17,20](#page-3-13)

#### **LEISHMANIASIS IN STEM CELL AND SOLID ORGAN TRANSPLANT RECIPIENTS**

The number of published cases of leishmaniasis in transplant recipients has quadrupled since the 1990s, accounting for more than 100 cases. Leishmaniasis affects men three times more than women, and older transplant recipients are at higher risk.[25–27](#page-3-15) It can have a broad clinical presentation, including visceral leishmaniasis (VL) (known as *kala-azar*), cutaneous, and mucocutaneous disease. VL is most common and is life threatening.[18](#page-3-16) Occasionally, cutaneous and mucocutaneous disease progresses to visceral disease. Disease is usually a reactivation of the dormant parasite. De novo transmission by infected sandfly and blood- or organ-derived transmission has been reported. Leishmaniasis is known for the triad of persistent fever, pancytopenia, and hepatosplenomegaly, although in transplant recipients the presentation is atypical.[27,28](#page-3-17)

Classically, the diagnosis of VL is made by histopathology of visceral organs, bone marrow, and, less frequently, by splenic aspirate. Among SOT recipients, splenic biopsy has a sensitivity of 98% compared with 70% in immunocompetent individuals[.18](#page-3-16) Polymerase chain reaction (PCR) assays of blood or bone marrow are 90% sensitive in detecting VL[.26](#page-3-18) For diagnosis of cutaneous or mucocutaneous leishmaniasis, histopathology and molecular testing of the tissue are used.

Liposomal amphotericin B is the drug of choice for treatment, with an estimated cure rate of 80% to 84% in VL among SOT compared with 55% to 66% in HIV co-infected individuals and 95% in the general population. The risk of relapse among transplant recipients is lower than in HIV. Miltefosine, either alone or in combination with amphotericin B, has been used in relapsed cases. Currently, there is no consensus regarding screening of recipients or donors. However, the American Society of Transplantation (AST) recommends screening high-risk populations. Given the low incidence of disease and sub-optimal screening tests, primary prophylaxis is not recommended.[25–29](#page-3-15)

In a review of 10 published cases of leishmaniasis among SCT, the majority of the cases were allogeneic. All cases had VL with one case of concomitant mucosal and one of cutaneous disease. GVHD and secondary infections like cytomegalovirus (CMV) were the most common complications. In the majority, diagnosis was made by bone marrow biopsy and bone marrow or blood PCR. All cases were treated with liposomal amphotericin, with a 30% relapse rate after 1 to 8 months; one recipient died.[26](#page-3-18)

Among SOT recipients, renal transplants comprise over 75% of the cases. This predominance is thought to be due to the higher number of kidney transplants. High doses of immunosuppressive drugs are a significant risk factor in the development of disease. The majority were treated with amphotericin, with a relapse rate of 25% within 1 year of treatment. Only one third of patients had the classic triad of leishmaniasis at the time of diagnosis, emphasizing the importance of a high index of suspicion in this population.[18,29](#page-3-16)

#### **STRONGYLOIDIASIS IN STEM CELL AND SOLID ORGAN TRANSPLANT RECIPIENTS**

*Strongyloides stercoralis* is uncommon among transplant recipients; however, if unrecognized, the disease can be fatal with the development of disseminated disease and hyper-infection syndrome. Reactivation of chronic *Strongyloides* infection is usual, although cases of donor-derived infection are reported[.30](#page-3-19) Clinical manifestations involve the gastrointestinal tract, lungs, or skin. In severe cases, the presence of gram-negative bacteremia could be a clue; this can occur as parasites migrate from the intestinal tract to the bloodstream. The classic eosinophilia of parasitic infections is not a reliable marker. Direct microscopic detection of the parasite is the gold standard for diagnosis. Molecular testing also offers high sensitivity and specificity.[31](#page-3-20) The AST guidelines recommend screening donors and recipients from endemic areas.

Ivermectin is used for both prophylaxis and treatment. In severe cases, addition of albendazole/thiabendazole has been used with equivocal results[.30](#page-3-19) Only 10 cases of strongyloidiasis among hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (HSCT) have been reported, with the majority in allogeneic recipients.[32](#page-3-21)

There has been a steady increase in the number of strongyloidiasis cases among SOT recipients that has been attributed to the transition from cyclosporine to tacrolimus. Cyclosporine has some anti-parasitic properties. Among 27 cases of donor-derived infections, over 50% were in kidney transplant and all had received tacrolimus[.30,32](#page-3-19)

### **TOXOPLASMOSIS IN STEM CELL AND SOLID ORGAN TRANSPLANT RECIPIENTS**

Endogenous reactivation of the dormant cyst during immunosuppression is the most common mode of disease acquisition. Transmission by transplantation of cyst-containing organ or ingestion of undercooked meat is reported.[33](#page-3-22)

Toxoplasmosis can manifest as asymptomatic parasitemia, ocular, cerebral, or disseminated disease. For diagnosis, PCR is more reliable than serology. Clinical signs and imaging should always raise the suspicion despite a negative PCR result.

Currently, screening of donors and recipients is not mandatory but is recommended by most experts. Chemoprophylaxis is effective in the following circumstances: in individuals who seroconvert, when there is discordant serology between donors and recipients, and in heart transplant recipients.[33](#page-3-22)

Among 180 immunosuppressed individuals who were PCRpositive for *Toxoplasma gondii,* over a third were allograft-HSCT recipients. These recipients tended to acquire infection shortly after engraftment with rapid progression to disseminated disease[.34](#page-3-23) SCT recipients have a high mortality of 33% to 62%[.34,35](#page-3-23)

Among SOT, heart transplant recipients are at the highest risk of acquiring donor-derived infection because heart muscles harbor cysts[.33](#page-3-22) SOT recipients are also prone to disseminated infection with a high mortality rate[.35,36](#page-3-24)

### **CHAGAS DISEASE (AMERICAN TRYPANOSOMIASIS) IN STEM CELL AND SOLID ORGAN TRANSPLANT RECIPIENTS**

Chagas disease is endemic in Latin America. Transplant recipients are infected through organ transplantation, blood transfusion, or reactivation of chronic disease, although post-transplant de novo infections have been reported. The risk of Chagas disease is highest during the first year after transplantation. Clinical presentation is similar to acute organ rejection, characterized by fever, rash, gastrointestinal symptoms, and myocarditis in heart transplants[.17,37,38](#page-3-13)

Pre-transplant screening of recipients and donors is done routinely in endemic areas. A heart for transplantation should not be accepted from an infected donor. For other organs, there is no consensus and the decision is made on a case-by-case basis[.17,38](#page-3-13) Microscopy, histopathology, serology, and molecular testing have variable sensitivity and specificity.[39](#page-3-25) Benznidazole is used as a first-line agent and nifurtimox as the second-line agent for treatment. Treatment of asymptomatic recipients is controversial. Clinical and laboratory surveillance of chronically infected recipients is recommended[.37,39](#page-3-26)

Among SCT recipients, only a limited number of case reports of Chagas disease have been published.[19](#page-3-27) Risk of reactivation is estimated at 17% to 40%, with a higher incidence in allogeneic compared with autologous or SOT recipients.[40](#page-3-28)

The risk of Chagas transmission from a seropositive donor to a seronegative recipient is the highest in heart transplants.[18](#page-3-16) This is because of preferential trophism of *Trypanosoma cruzi* for myocardial cells. In endemic areas, chagasic cardiomyopathy is the most common reason for heart transplantation.[37](#page-3-26)
