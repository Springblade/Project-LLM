# **138.3** Invasive Larvae of Flies (Myiasis) and Fleas (Tungiasis)

*David A. Warrell*

#### **MYIASI[S1-3](#page-1-0)**

Infestation of living animals by larval flies (Insecta, Diptera) is known as myiasis. In humans, larvae of three families of flies have been associated with myiasis: Oestridae (botflies), Calliphoridae (blowflies), and Sarcophagidae (fleshflies). Myiasis is classified by its location as cutaneous, wound (traumatic), nasopharyngeal, orbital, ophthalmic, aural, urogenital, pulmonary, and intestinal.

Primary or specific myiasis is caused by flies whose larvae are obligate parasites of living tissues; opportunistic or secondary myiasis by saprophagous larvae that feed on decaying tissue; and accidental myiasis by coprophagous larvae that enter the gastrointestinal tract by chance, or by inhalation of the gravid female fly to cause pulmonary myiasis.

Aural, nasopharyngeal, and malignant wound myiases are potentially lethal, demanding removal of the larvae, debridement, and reconstructive surgery. Diagnosis is by discovering and expertly identifying larvae (preserved in strong ethanol) from infested patients.

#### **CUTANEOUS MYIASI[S4](#page-1-1)**

Human bot flies, also known as *ver macaque, berne, el torsalo,* or *beefworm* (*Dermatobia hominis,* Oestridae), are a common cause of dermal myiasis in Central and South America. Their eggs are deposited on biting arthropods, such as mosquitoes, which carry them to the skin of the host. Here, the eggs hatch and the larvae burrow into the skin. The larva grows to more than 1 cm in length over the next 10 weeks, producing a boil with a small aperture ([Figs.138.3.1A and B\)](#page-0-0). An early symptom is sporadic pain caused by the spiny larva. Unless the eye is involved, infestation is generally harmless. Secondary infection of the wound is the most common complication.

Tumbu flies, also known as *putsi fIy* or *ver du cayor* (*Cordylobia anthropophaga,* Calliphoridae), occur throughout sub-Saharan Africa and southern Spain. Females lay their eggs, usually on urine- or feces-contaminated sand or moist soil and on soiled clothes hung outside to dry. Skin contact with viable ova on clothing results in infestation. Larvae penetrate the skin and grow to maturity in about 10 days. A painful inflamed boil develops, which seems to wriggle, exudes blood-stained pus, and has a definite head, through which the larval spiracles may protrude ([Fig. 138.3.2](#page-1-2)). There may be associated fever and lymphadenopathy.

Warble fly (*Hypoderma* spp., Oestridae, e.g., reindeer/caribou warble fly—*H. tarandi*) and horse bot fly (*Gasterophilus* spp., Oestridae) larvae, normally parasitic on deer, horses, and cattle, can invade human skin causing intense itching and migratory eruptions.[5](#page-1-3)

#### **Prevention and Treatment**

Ironing the washed clothing before it is worn destroys the eggs and prevents tumbu fly infestation. Larvae can be excised under local anesthetic. Folk remedies such as the application of raw meat, glue, or petroleum jelly to the lesion usually fail. Squeezing may rupture the larva, causing inflammation or a granulomatous reaction.

### **WOUND MYIASIS**

Larvae of many species of flies invade open wounds and feed on necrotic tissue—a habit that has been employed therapeutically to debride wounds and promote healing.

New World screw-worms *Cochliomyia hominivorax* (Calliphoridae) in the Americas and North Africa and Old World screw-worms, *Chrysomya bezziana* (Calliphoridae) and Wohlfahrt's wound myiasis fly *Wohlfahrtia magnifica* (Sarcophagidae) in the Old World are obligate parasites of living tissue. Larvae hatch from eggs laid on wounds in the ears, nasal cavity, orbit, mucous membranes, and genitalia. They burrow en masse into healthy tissue, causing destruction, and even death, from secondary bacterial infection.

A massive epidemic of *C. hominivorax* myiasis, mainly in sheep in Northern Africa, started in 1989. It was controlled by releasing 1260 million sterile male *C. hominivorax* flies in the 15,000 km2 infested area. Wounds should be protected from flies. Treatment involves surgical removal of the larvae, debridement of affected tissue, and treatment of secondary infection. Reconstructive surgery may be required.

## **OPHTHALMOMYIASIS (OCULAR MYIASIS[\)6,7](#page-1-4)**

Fewer than 5% of cases of human myiasis affect the eye. Usually, only external structures, such as the lids and conjunctivae, are infested, but some fly larvae can penetrate the conjunctiva or sclera, causing corneal ulceration and damage to anterior and posterior internal structures that may result in blindness. The usual cause of ophthalmomyiasis externa is *Oestrus ovis,* the cosmopolitan sheep and goat nasal botfly, whose natural host is herbivorous mammals. Although most common in tropical developing countries (especially in North Africa, the Middle East, and the Caribbean), it still occurs rarely in Western cities. Female flies eject their larvae into the nostrils of the host, where they mature. Human victims may give a history of having been buzzed in the face or struck on the eye by an insect and later developing irritation and redness of the eye, foreign body sensation, pain, lacrimation, palpebral edema, and signs of purulent conjunctivitis or a sty (hordeolum). *O. ovis* larvae cling to the conjunctivae and may cause follicular conjunctival reaction and pseudomembrane formation. They rarely develop beyond the first instar in humans and so symptoms are self-limiting, but symptoms are relieved by removing larvae under slit-lamp examination. Other causes of human ophthalmomyiasis include *Rhinoestrus purpureum, Dermatobia hominis, Hypoderma* spp. (Oestridae), *Cochlyomyia hominis, Lucilia* spp., and *Phormia* spp. (Calliphoridae). Larvae of *Hypoderma, Cochlyomyia,* and *Dermatobia* are more dangerous, as they may burrow into the eye, resulting in pain, nausea, and destruction. They must be surgically removed.

#### **CONGO FLOOR MAGGOTS**

Larvae of the fly *Auchmeromyia luteola* live in earthen floors of huts throughout tropical Africa between latitudes 18°N and 26°S.

They suck blood from those sleeping on the ground, causing local swelling and itching.

#### **Prevention and Treatment**

Avoid sleeping on the ground. Fumigate the hut. Treat bites symptomatically. If there are signs of infection, wipe the skin with tincture of iodine and give systemic antimicrobials.

#### **TUNGIASI[S8](#page-1-5)**

Tungiasis—also known as *nigua*, *pio/bicho de pie*, and *pique*, in South America, the Caribbean, and sub-Saharan Africa—is caused by the "chigger," "jigger," or "chigoe" flea (*Tunga penetrans,* family Hectopsyllidae), which must not be confused with trombiculid mites, also known as *"chiggers"* or *harvest mites*. Adult female fleas are acquired while walking barefoot in the sand. They burrow into the epidermis of the toes and foot, causing itching or painful lesions.

After fertilization, the female flea jumps (feebly) and burrows alongside the nailfold or into the skin of the groin, loses her legs, swells to 10 mm in diameter, and produces eggs each night. A painful swelling develops, typically under a toenail, with the risk of secondary infection and even fatal tetanus.

#### **Treatment**

The encapsulated flea must be curetted out and iodine applied. Complete enucleation is required.

#### **Prevention**

Wear proper shoes rather than walking barefooted.

#### **DIFFERENTIATING CUTANEOUS MYIASIS FROM OTHER CREEPING ERUPTIONS**

Arthropod infestations must be distinguished from "creeping eruption" (cutaneous larva migrans) caused by larvae of cat and dog hookworms, such as *Ancylostoma braziliense, Uncinaria stenocephala,* and *Ancylostoma caninum,* usually acquired by lying on a beach in Central/Southern America. Hookworm larvae move day by day, producing an itchy or painful tortuous, serpiginous track. Migratory myiasis larvae (*Gastrophilus* and *Hypoderma*) also produce dark serpentine tracks, initially without making any aperture, but they are large enough to be visible, move more slowly, migrate less extensively, and can persist for much longer (months) than hookworm larvae (see Chapter 124).
