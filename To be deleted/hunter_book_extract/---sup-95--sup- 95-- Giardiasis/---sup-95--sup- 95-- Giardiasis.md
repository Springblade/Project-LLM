#### KEY FEATURES

- • Giardiasis is a small-intestinal infection that presents with subacute diarrhea, malabsorption, and weight loss.
- • Asymptomatic infections are common, especially in children in highly endemic regions.
- • Transmission may occur by ingestion of contaminated water or from direct fecal–oral transmission.
- • The diagnosis is established by stool microscopy or stool antigen tests.
- • Nitroimidazoles are the mainstay of treatment.
- • Symptoms of irritable bowel syndrome may occur after resolution of infection.

### **INTRODUCTION**

Giardiasis is a small-intestinal infection resulting from infection with the flagellated protozoan parasite *Giardia lamblia* (syn. *G. intestinalis, G. duodenalis*), likely first reported by Van Leeuwenhoek in 1681[.1](#page-4-0)

### **EPIDEMIOLOGY**

*G. lamblia* is constituted by eight different molecular types (genotypes A–H), each with some degree of host specificity. It is likely some of these genotypes will eventually be considered distinct species. Genotypes A and B are found in humans and occasionally in a variety of other mammals. Conversely, genotypes C through H are found in a variety of other mammals.[1–3](#page-4-0) They have a moderate degree of host specificity and have never been identified from human infections. Therefore it is likely that most human infections result (directly or indirectly) from human-to-human transmission. However, there are clearly exceptions. Beavers have been implicated as a source of water-borne human outbreaks in a couple of reports. Some controversy remains regarding the potential of household pets, especially dogs, as sources for human infection. Most studies have shown the predominant or exclusive presence of genotypes C and D in dogs. However, some studies have identified genotypes A and B in dogs, fueling the controversy.

The most commonly identified risk factors relate to water-borne transmission, including backpacking, recreational water use, or having a shallow well for drinking water. Occasional large outbreaks due to contaminated water have been identified, including a recent outbreak of over 3000 symptomatic cases in a Norwegian city. The seasonality of infections in the United States with increased occurrence in the summer and early fall probably reflects the increased use of recreational water facilities.

The increased incidence in children who attend daycare facilities reflects direct fecal–oral transmission, and the increased incidence in homosexual men most likely results from oral–anal sexual contact. HIV infection has not been reported as a significant risk factor. Although less common than water-borne transmission, food-borne transmission has also been documented. Hypogammaglobulinemia has been associated with an increased risk of giardiasis[.4](#page-4-1) Isolated immunoglobulin A deficiency may also be a risk factor but remains controversial. Impaired gastric acid secretion also increases the risk for acquisition of giardiasis.

Within the United States, northern states have a higher incidence of giardiasis than the southern states, with case rates peaking at 30 per 100,000 population in Vermont (U.S. average = 7)[,5](#page-4-2) perhaps due to more prolonged cyst survival in cool moist climates. These rates markedly underestimate the incidence, but stool prevalence rates of 2% to 5% are primarily from symptomatic patients and are overestimates.

Although there is little evidence for acquired resistance to infection, there appears to be partial resistance to symptomatic infection. Evidence includes a water-borne outbreak of giardiasis in a ski resort in the Rocky Mountains of the United States, where local residents had a lower risk of symptoms. Similarly, very high rates of symptomatic disease (50%–100%) have been reported in Finnish travelers to St. Petersburg, Russia, in the 1960s. In contrast, children in highly endemic regions such as Peru or Palestine are frequently asymptomatic; for example, in a shanty town near Lima, Peru, where the quality of available drinking water is poor, children are universally infected by the age of 2 years and are rapidly reinfected after treatment.[6](#page-4-3) In these otherwise asymptomatic children, there is some evidence for growth retardation. However, because of malnutrition and other infection, it has been difficult to determine whether there is a causal relationship between giardiasis and growth retardation in these children. These observations suggest at least two very different patterns of transmission and disease. Populations with high rates of water contamination and continuing endemic transmission typically have high prevalence rates but few attributable symptoms. Conversely, in populations with generally safe water, transmission is irregular and prevalence is low. However, when infections do occur, they are frequently symptomatic.

## **NATURAL HISTORY, PATHOGENESIS, AND PATHOLOGY**

The life cycle of *G. lamblia* consists of two forms: the trophozoite and the cyst. The cyst is oval in shape and approximately 8 by 12 µm in size and contains four nuclei that can be visualized microscopically. The cyst is environmentally resistant, and as few as 10 cysts can initiate infection after ingestion. After passage through the stomach, the cyst excysts to produce two binucleate trophozoites that are pear-shaped and approximately 10 to 12 µm in length by 5 to 7 µm in width. The trophozoites move by beating four pairs of flagellae and attach to the wall of the small intestine by their concave ventral sucking disk ([Fig. 95.1\)](#page-1-0). When the trophozoites detach from the intestinal wall, an imprint displays the site of their attachment. The trophozoites replicate by binary fission, and some of these trophozoites encyst after exposure to bile or as a result of cholesterol starvation and are passed in the feces to continue the cycle of infection[.7](#page-4-4)

The course of naturally acquired giardiasis is highly variable, ranging from transient colonization to prolonged infection and from asymptomatic to severe diarrhea and weight loss. As noted earlier, partial immunity may account for some of those differences. In addition, there is some evidence for differences in pathogenicity among different isolates. In human volunteer studies, all 10 volunteers became infected with the GS isolate (genotype B) and 5 developed symptoms. On the other hand, none of the five volunteers were infected with ISR (genotype A1). Genotype A2 differs about 1% to 2% from genotype A1 in DNA sequence, whereas genotype

<span id="page-1-0"></span>B differs by nearly 20% from both, suggesting that it may properly be considered a different species. Interestingly, some studies correlating symptoms with genotype have found that genotype B infections are more frequently symptomatic, whereas others have found that symptoms are more associated with genotype A2. Genotype A1 has seldom been identified in these studies.

Patients with symptomatic disease have villous shortening, which can range from mild to severe, both from one patient to another and even within the same patient. Chronic inflammatory changes are frequently found.

There is no evidence for toxin-mediated diarrhea and mucosal invasion has not been convincingly shown. Therefore much of the recent interest has focused on an immunopathogenic mechanism for the diarrhea. Animal model[s8](#page-4-6) and human observations[9](#page-4-7) have shown epithelial cell dysfunction and impairment of the barrier function, likely involving intraepithelial lymphocytes.

The surfaces of trophozoites are coated with a cysteine-rich variant-specific surface protein (VSP) that evokes a significant immune response[.10](#page-4-8) However, the organism can switch expression from one to another member of this large gene family, and this antigenic variation may contribute to the chronicity of the infection.

### **CLINICAL FEATURES**

For patients who develop symptomatic disease, there is typically a 1- to 2-week incubation period after exposure, followed by diarrhea that may be self-limited but frequently lasts 6 weeks or longer in the absence of treatment. [Table 95.1](#page-1-2) shows the approximate frequency of symptoms reported from a number of studies of symptomatic giardiasis[.11–16](#page-4-5) Patients typically have diarrhea or loose stools marked by loose greasy stools with a foul odor. The daily stool volume is typically normal, and one to several stools daily is usual. The diarrhea is frequently accompanied by abdominal pain, bloating, flatulence, and malabsorption with weight loss (see [Table 95.1](#page-1-2)). Fatigue is commonly found. Fever is uncommon, and when present, it is found early and resolves within a few days. Bloody diarrhea and systemic toxicity are not seen with giardiasis and should raise the suspicion for invasive bacterial infections or amebiasis.

The physical examination is typically normal or demonstrates non-specific abnormalities. Mild abdominal tenderness may be present, but severe tenderness should suggest an alternative diagnosis. Likewise, significant fluid loss is uncommon with giardiasis, so evidence of dehydration on examination or by laboratory testing should prompt a search for alternative diagnoses.

#### **PATIENT EVALUATION, DIAGNOSIS, AND DIFFERENTIAL DIAGNOSIS**

Giardiasis should be suspected in patients who present with sub-acute or chronic diarrhea, especially when the diarrhea is accompanied by weight loss. The onset of giardiasis can be relatively indolent, and frequently patients do not present for evaluation early; therefore giardiasis should be considered seriously in patients with at least 5 to 7 days of diarrhea. In contrast, most diarrhea caused by viral and bacterial pathogens resolves within 3 to 5 days[.17](#page-4-9) In addition, the incubation period for giardiasis is typically 1 to 2 weeks, which distinguishes it from many other infectious etiologies. The differential diagnosis includes those illnesses that present with sub-acute or chronic diarrhea of a small intestinal source. The fluid and electrolyte loss caused by some small intestinal pathogens is distinctly uncommon with giardiasis. Thus the list of pathogens that could produce diarrhea mimicking giardiasis is short but could include atypical presentations of *Campylobacter* or *Salmonella* infections. Both celiac disease and tropical sprue present with chronic diarrhea that may be accompanied by weight loss. Giardiasis typically has a more readily defined onset of symptoms than celiac disease or tropical sprue. Celiac disease may be a more common cause of diarrhea in the United States but is much less common in many developing regions, so a travel and exposure history is important. Whipple's disease is rare but can present with chronic diarrhea and weight loss. Extraintestinal manifestations are common with Whipple's but are not seen with giardiasis, with the exception of the occasional urticarial rash that has been reported. Lactose intolerance is a common cause of chronic diarrhea but does not cause weight loss and resolves with elimination of lactose from the diet. Irritable bowel syndrome frequently presents with chronic diarrhea but does not cause weight loss; as noted later, it is particularly common after an episode of giardiasis. Chronic diarrhea is commonly found in advanced HIV infection, with or without an identifiable pathogen. Conversely, HIV-infected patients are at increased risk for a variety of enteric pathogens, but there is not a notable increase in frequency or severity of giardiasis in these patients. *Campylobacter* or *Salmonella* spp. can occasionally cause prolonged diarrhea, so these pathogens should be considered.

The initial diagnostic test when giardiasis is considered is a microscopic examination of a concentrated fecal specimen for cysts or trophozoites. Cysts are much more commonly found than trophozoites and can be identified equally well from fresh or preserved specimens. In contrast, freshly collected specimens are required for the identification of trophozoites. When trophozoites

Numerous antigen-based and nucleic acid–based tests are on the market. This is a partial list. The major focus in nucleic acid testing has been in multiplex tests, some of which are limited to parasites and others that include parasites, bacteria, and viruses[.18,19,26](#page-4-10) *ELISA*, Enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay.

are found, they correlate highly with symptomatic infection. Three separate specimens should be evaluated for optimal sensitivity. Alternatively, several commercial *Giardia* cyst antigen tests are available, all of which detect cyst antigens in fecal samples, either by immunoassay or by immunofluorescence or chromatographic detection ([Table 95.2](#page-2-0)). These are more sensitive than conventional microscopy, such that a single test can suffice. The sensitivity of the immunoassay tests is in the 93% to 100% range and the fluorescent antibody test near 100% but with the caveat that there is not an adequate gold standard for a validation of the diagnosis, so these numbers should be taken with caution. The specificity of the tests is in the 98% to 99% range, so there should be few false-positive results in populations with a high prevalence. One limitation of these antigen-based tests is that they detect cysts but not trophozoites. However, the enzyme immunoassay is less labor-intensive and does not require the availability of a fluorescent microscope. The use of polymerase chain reaction (PCR) testing has been reported, particularly in multiplex assays for multiple gastrointestinal pathogens (see [Table 95.2\)](#page-2-0).[18,19](#page-4-10) Some include a broad panel of parasites, bacteria, and viruses, whereas others are limited to parasites. All these tests have good sensitivity and specificity for *G. lamblia,* but the exact clinical role of these multiplex tests is still in flux.

For some patients with giardiasis, fecal examinations are repeatedly negative, but *Giardia* trophozoites can be detected in the duodenum by endoscopy or by the string test. The string test involves the patient swallowing a capsule on the end of a string, pulling it out after 4 hours to overnight, and then examining the end microscopically for the presence of trophozoites. An alternative approach is to perform an upper endoscopy with a biopsy and sampling of duodenal contents (see [Fig. 95.2](#page-3-0) for a histologic specimen of the small intestine showing a flattened villous and a mononuclear inflammatory response), which adds the potential of identifying other entities such as tropical or celiac sprue.

There are no serologic tests that are useful for the diagnosis of giardiasis.

In clinical practice, it is very common to empirically treat for giardiasis in patients who have a clinical presentation consistent with giardiasis, especially in resource-poor areas.

#### **TREATMENT**

Drugs from several different classes have excellent efficacy for treatment of giardiasis ([Table 95.3\)](#page-3-1)[.20–23](#page-4-11) The nitroimidazoles are the most commonly used drugs in the United States, and perhaps worldwide, primarily metronidazole and tinidazole. These two drugs are essentially 100% absorbed by the oral route. Initial concerns regarding metronidazole in pregnancy have been allayed, at least for the second and third trimesters, by extensive experience with treating bacterial vaginosis. Nausea and a metallic taste are common and potentially treatment-limiting side effects. These drugs also have a disulfiram-like activity after ethanol ingestion, so alcohol use during treatment is prohibited. Single doses and short courses of therapy with metronidazole have had high failure rates, so treatment should be continued for 5 to 10 days, whereas tinidazole demonstrates excellent efficacy with single-dose therapy, which may make it the preferred agent in many settings. Secnidazole and ornidazole are other nitroimidazoles that have excellent efficacy with single-dose treatment courses but are not available in the United States.

Albendazole is an anti-helminthic agent that inhibits tubulin and has activity against giardiasis. In addition, its broad antihelminthic activity may be an advantage in settings with a high prevalence of intestinal helminth infections. However, single-dose therapy has demonstrated poor efficacy for the treatment of giardiasis, so treatment courses of 5 days are used. Some studies have shown reduced efficacy in comparison with nitroimidazoles[.23](#page-4-12) Albendazole has been associated with embryopathy, so it should be avoided at least during the first trimester of pregnancy.

Quinacrine has excellent efficacy and at one time was the drug of choice in the United States, but has been largely replaced by the nitroimidazoles, partly because of nausea and vomiting and occasional reports of psychosis.

Nitazoxanide has activity for *Giardia* and *Cryptosporidium* as well as other microbes and has been approved for use in the United States. It has been studied in children using 3-day courses, yielding response rates of about 70% to 80%, and has been well tolerated.

Furazolidone became popular for treating giardiasis in children because it is tolerated better than quinacrine and is available in liquid suspension. In clinical studies, it has yielded cure rates of 80% to 94%. However, compliance is more difficult than with some drugs, because it is administered four times daily for 7 to 10 days.

Paromomycin has been evaluated in a few earlier studies, demonstrating an efficacy of about 55% to 90%.[20](#page-4-11) It is commonly recommended for treatment of giardiasis during pregnancy, at least during the first trimester, because of its perceived safety in that setting.

Persistent symptoms after treatment of giardiasis are common and usually do not represent continued infection. After a large

outbreak of giardiasis in Norway, as much as 40% of patients had prolonged fatigue and abdominal symptoms without evidence of ongoing infectio[n24](#page-4-13) or benefit from *Giardia*-specific treatment. Persistent gastrointestinal symptoms are common after treatment of several other intestinal pathogens as well[.25](#page-4-14) Therefore if someone has persistent or recurrent symptoms after treatment for giardiasis, the presence or absence of giardiasis should be confirmed by fecal examination. A negative test in someone with persistent diarrhea but no weight loss suggests post-infectious irritable bowel disease or perhaps lactose intolerance. However, with a negative fecal examination in the setting of weight loss, upper endoscopy should be considered to identify other diagnoses such as gluten enteropathy.

For patients with documented relapse after treatment, retreatment is usually effective. Drug resistance has been proposed as a possible reason for treatment failure; however, because of culture difficulties, few susceptibility studies have been performed. In addition, relapses may be more common in the setting of immunoglobulin deficiency, so immunoglobulin levels should be determined. Patients who fail re-treatment with a standard course of a nitroimidazole usually respond to subsequent treatment with metronidazole in addition to either albendazole or quinacrine.

#### **PREVENTION**

The majority of cases of giardiasis occur through the ingestion of contaminated water, so backpackers and travelers to regions with inadequately purified water should purify the water by filtration with a 1- to 2-µm (or smaller) pore size or by heating the water to 70°C for 10 minutes or boiling. Halogenation will also inactivate cysts but must be prolonged. Contaminated hands are the source of *Giardia* in the setting of daycare or food; therefore handwashing should be employed.
