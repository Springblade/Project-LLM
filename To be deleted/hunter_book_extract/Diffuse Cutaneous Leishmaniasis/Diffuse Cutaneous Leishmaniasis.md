## Diffuse Cutaneous Leishmaniasis

Diffuse CL in Ethiopia and Kenya responds poorly to treatment with SbV. The WHO currently recommends 20 mg SbV/kg per day intramuscularly or intravenously plus paromomycin 15 mg (11-mg base)/kg per day intramuscularly for 60 days or longer to treat diffuse CL[.80](#page--1-1) Other regimens to consider include pentamidine, miltefosine, paromomycin, and combination SSG and paromomycin[.16](#page-0-0) Whatever the regimen used, treatment should be prolonged for several weeks beyond clinical healing, and anticipate that failure is common.

#### **PREVENTION AND CONTROL**

## **Vector Control**

Reducing the vector population can decrease the incidence of CL. Improved general sanitation and removal of refuse and rubble in which sandflies breed reduce the incidence of urban CL. Residual spraying with DDT for malaria control had eliminated CL in many areas, although it has returned with the cessation of spraying.

# **Immunization**

Intracutaneous vaccination with live, attenuated *L. major* promastigotes ("leishmanization") was used for many years in Russia, Israel, and Iran. A lesion was allowed to develop resulting in a single scar in a cosmetically acceptable location, and the immunity that developed was comparable to that after a natural infection.[22,23](#page-0-1) There is a small risk of developing a CL lesion requiring treatment or the development of leishmaniasis recidivans at the site of immunization, as well as theoretical risk if the vaccinee is immunocompromised[.24](#page-0-2)

# **104.4** Cutaneous Leishmaniasis of the New World

*Naomi E. Aronson, Alan J. Magill* [†](#page-0-3)

#### **DEFINITION**

<span id="page-0-3"></span>CL of the New World is a zoonosis caused by parasites of the species complexes *L. mexicana* and *L. Viannia braziliensis* (see [Table](#page--1-0) [104.1.1\)](#page--1-0). ML, also known as *espundia,* is characterized by destructive oral, nasal, or pharyngeal lesions and is usually associated with *L.*(*V). braziliensis* infection. Local names for New World CL include uta (Peru), chiclero ulcer or bay sore (Mexico), dicera de Baurid (Brazil), and pian bois or forest yaws (Guyana). Collectively, these diseases are also referred to as *American CL.*

# **ETIOLOGY**

New World CL parasites are divided into two complexes, the *L. (Leishmania)* complex and *L. (Viannia)* complex, that are known to infect humans (see [Table 104.1.1\)](#page--1-0). *L. infantum* (*syn. chagasi*) has also been isolated from lesions of CL, albeit less frequently.

# **DISTRIBUTION AND EPIDEMIOLOGY**

The geographic distribution of New World CL is shown in [Fig.](#page--1-2) [104.3.1B.](#page--1-2) New World CL in returning travelers from endemic areas should be considered when evaluating an ulcerative lesion in persons with an exposure.[1,2](#page-4-0) Sylvatic or wild transmission cycles are adapting to peri-domestic environments, with domestic animal reservoirs associated with increasing urbanization. In addition, people moving into endemic areas for natural products extraction (oil and gas, timber, road building, etc.), armed conflicts, and increasingly adventurous travel/ecotourism lead to new infections and epidemics of CL in non-immune people[.3](#page-4-1)

# *Leishmania mexicana*

The parasite causing chiclero ulcer is common throughout southern Mexico, Belize, and Guatemala and causes the rare cases of CL acquired in Texas and Oklahoma. It is transmitted by *Lutzomyia olmeca,* which is not highly attracted to humans. Chicle tree workers collecting gum latex, timber cutters, road builders, and agricultural workers are commonly infected.

## *Leishmania amazonensis*

This parasite occurs in the Amazon region of Brazil and neighboring countries. It is primarily a disease of forest rodents, but marsupials and foxes can be secondary hosts. Infection rates of 20% occur in some rodent species in Brazil, but human disease is uncommon because the vector *Lutzomyia flaviscutellata* is nocturnal, is not very anthropophilic, and lives in swampy areas of the forest seldom frequented by people.

#### *Leishmania venezuelensis*

This parasite has been isolated only from humans with CL and diffuse CL in Venezuela.

#### *Leishmania (Viannia) braziliensis*

*Leishmania (V.) braziliensis* causes CL and ML in humans. Human infection occurs in all endemic countries of the Americas except Guyana, Surinam, and the United States. *L.(V.) braziliensis* likely causes a spectrum of illness across its geographic range and is associated with multiple sandfly vectors. Disease is common among persons living in farming communities in newly cleared forest areas and in road construction and mining workers[.4](#page-4-2)

#### *Leishmania (Viannia) panamensis*

This parasite is found from Guatemala in the north, through Central America, to Colombia and Ecuador in the south. The principal reservoir is the tree sloth, *Choloepus hoffmanni.* Other sloths, procyonids, and forest primates are secondary hosts. The major vector, *Lutzomyia trapidoi,* usually lives in the forest canopy in close contact with the known reservoirs; but when rainfall is moderate, it can be found close to the ground where it can bite humans. Human disease is common in rural agricultural workers, especially before deforestation is complete, and in military personnel participating in jungle warfare training.

## *Leishmania (Viannia) guyanensis*

Pian bois or forest yaws, the human disease caused by *L.(V.) guyanensis,* occurs in the Guyanas and northern Brazil. The principal vector, *Lutzomyia umbratilis,* has a high infection rate (up to 7%) and readily bites humans in the daytime when disturbed from its resting sites on tree trunks. The major reservoir of *L.(V.) guyanensis* is the two-toed forest sloth.

# *Leishmania (Viannia) peruviana*

*Leishmania (V.) peruviana* is found in high Andean valleys between 800 and 3000 meters above sea level in Peru. Dogs with inapparent infection are the principal reservoir hosts for transmission. Human disease (uta) is contracted peri-domestically; in some villages, 90% of people are infected or scarred.

# **Infections Caused by Other** *Leishmania* **Species**

Parasites have been cultured from lesions of CL in various parts of South America that have isoenzyme patterns and growth characteristics in culture and laboratory animals that are different from those of known species of *Leishmania. L. infantum (syn. L. chagasi)* causes non-ulcerative nodular CL (see [Fig. 104.3.3\)](#page--1-3).

#### **Diffuse Cutaneous Leishmaniasis**

Diffuse CL is rarely seen in Bolivia, Brazil, Colombia, Costa Rica, Dominican Republic, Ecuador, Guatemala, Mexico, Peru, Venezuela, or the United States. Diffuse CL in the New World is usually associated with *L. mexicana* and *L. amazonensis* infections. The initial lesion is usually a macule, papule, or nodule (rarely an ulcer). Because of an immunologic defect in the host, the parasite spreads locally and hematogenously to cause generalized nodular lesions consisting of heavily parasitized macrophages. The nasal mucosa and laryngopharynx are sometimes involved, but visceral lesions do not occur.

#### **Disseminated Cutaneous Leishmaniasis**

Disseminated leishmaniasis (DL) is a syndrome described mainly in immunocompetent persons in Brazil, principally caused by *L.*(*V.*) *braziliensis* or *L. amazonensis* infection.[5,6](#page-4-3) Persons with DL have hundreds of skin lesions that are pleomorphic, acneiform papules or ulcers in several non-contiguous body sites [\(Fig. 104.4.1](#page-1-0))[.7](#page-4-4) Mucosal involvement occurs in up to 44% of patients.[8](#page-4-5) The infecting *L.*(*V*). *braziliensis* strain produces high levels of

pro-inflammatory cytokines. DL is also seen in immunocompromised hosts (AIDS, solid organ transplant), but the pathogenesis is different and parasites are plentiful.[9,10](#page-4-6)

# **CLINICAL MANIFESTATIONS**

#### **Cutaneous Disease**

The lesions of New World CL progress similarly to those of Old World disease. A few weeks to several months after infection, an erythematous, often pruritic, papule develops at the site of inoculation. The initial papule may become scaly or gradually enlarge, "like a volcano," developing a raised, indurated margin with central ulceration. Nodular lesions are seen in about 10% of cases. Ulcerative lesions are usually painless unless secondarily infected. The natural history varies depending on the infecting species, the location of the lesion on the body, and host immunity. *L. mexicana* infections generally have one or a few lesions that heal spontaneously within 6 months. In Guatemala, 22 out of 25 lesions caused by *L. mexicana* (88%) completely re-epithelialized by a median lesion age of 14 weeks (range: 6–44 weeks) and 17 (68%) were classified as cured 6 months later.[11](#page-4-7) However, lesions on the ear (chiclero's ulcer) occur in 40% of patients and are chronic, lasting many years. Cutaneous lesions caused by parasites of the *L.*(*V.) braziliensis* complex generally require 6 to 18 months for spontaneous healing but sometimes persist much longer.[12](#page-4-8) In addition, enlargement of the lymph nodes draining the bite site commonly accompanies, or precedes, the ulcer in *L.*(*V.*) *braziliensis* infections.[13,14](#page-4-9) Multiple skin lesions are common with *L. guyanensis* infections, and subcutaneous lymphatic nodules resembling sporotrichosis are often seen in *L.* (*V.*) *panamensis* infections [\(Fig. 104.4.2](#page-2-0)).

#### **Mucosal Leishmaniasis**

ML is a metastatic complication usually associated with New World CL and is the primary reason that New World CL is treated systemically. About 5% to 10% of persons infected with *L.* (*V.*) *braziliensis,* or, less commonly, *L.* (*V.*) *panamensis, L.* (*V.*) *guyanensis,* or *L. amazonensis* develop mucous membrane involvement during or months to years after their skin lesions have healed[.4,15–17](#page-4-2) ML is more commonly seen in Bolivia, Brazil, and Peru and is less common in northern South America and Central America[.16](#page-4-10) The nasal mucosa is the first site involved; patients may complain of nasal

stuffiness, difficulty in breathing through their nose, and occasional epistaxis as their first symptoms. This proceeds to septum ulceration (covered with a mucopurulent exudate) and often subsequent mutilating destruction of the nasal septum [\(Fig. 104.4.3\)](#page-2-1), palate, lips, pharynx, and larynx in severe ML. The lesions are chronic and progressive, and death can be caused by suicide, aspiration, or inanition. Hoarseness should prompt evaluation of the vocal cords for laryngeal involvement. ML does not spontaneously resolve, and it is more difficult to treat (especially in patients with severe or extensive disease); secondary bacterial infections are common.

#### **DIAGNOSIS**

# **Demonstration of the Organism**

As in other forms of leishmaniasis, definitive diagnosis requires demonstration of the parasite. The methods are the same as those for diagnosis of CL of the Old World, and multiple assays are recommended to maximize diagnostic yield (see [Section 104.3](#page--1-4)). It is important to completely debride the crusted exudative material from the ulcer before trying to scrape or aspirate. This can be painful for the patient, and local anesthesia with injectable 1% lidocaine with epinephrine is recommended. Yields of parasites are similar whether the material is collected from the edge of the lesion or from the ulcer base, provided appropriate debridement is performed. The sensitivity of culture can also be improved by 20% to 25% if three to five cultures per ulcerative lesion are

<span id="page-2-1"></span>![](_page_2_Picture_15.jpeg)

obtained.[18,19](#page-4-11) Organisms are generally more numerous in smears and biopsy specimens of CL caused by *L. mexicana* but are often scanty in *L.*(*V.*) *braziliensis* infection, especially in long-standing disease. Culture or PCR may allow species identification, which can guide management. PCR is an essential tool for diagnosis of pauciparasitic ML. Although assay performance is laboratory dependent, the use of real-time PCR to amplify *Leishmania* DNA targets is now common in endemic areas.

# **Serologic Tests**

Standard serologic tests are not useful for diagnosis of New World CL or ML.

#### **Differential Diagnosis**

New World CL must be distinguished from sporotrichosis, blastomycosis, yaws, syphilis, cutaneous tuberculosis, *Mycobacterium marinum* infection, actinomycosis, vasculitis, and dermatologic cancers. Diseases that may resemble espundia include paracoccidioidomycosis, histoplasmosis, tuberculosis, syphilis, malignant tumors, and lethal midline granuloma. Nodular diffuse CL must be differentiated from lepromatous leprosy.

#### **TREATMENT**

Detailed clinical practice guidelines for the diagnosis and treatment of leishmaniasis have been published by the Infectious Diseases Society of America and the American Society of Tropical Medicine and Hygiene. These can be found at [https://www.idsociety.org/](https://www.idsociety.org/practice-guideline/leishmaniasis/) [practice-guideline/leishmaniasis/.](https://www.idsociety.org/practice-guideline/leishmaniasis/)

#### **New World Cutaneous Leishmaniasis**

Systemic chemotherapy is generally indicated in New World CL, in contrast to Old World CL. New World CL tends to be more severe and to last longer than CL of the Old World. Indications for systemic treatment include the multiplicity of lesions, the chronicity of untreated disease, or progression of mucosal disease in the absence of chemotherapy. The therapeutic decision is a risk:benefit ratio of the intervention for each patient; no single treatment approach fits all clinical presentations. Experience with local therapy for New World CL is limited, as local therapy was long considered unsuitable, especially in those patients infected with *L.(V.) braziliensis* or *L.(V.) panamensis* because of the potential risk of ML and the expectation that systemic treatment could prevent metastasis and mucosal involvement. However, systemic treatment does not guarantee prevention of later ML. Investigation is ongoing as to the role of local therapy in the treatment of New World CL.

#### Pentavalent Antimonial Drugs

A randomized controlled trial in patients with *L.*(*V.*) *panamensis* infection showed that treatment with SSG at a dosage of 20 mg of SbV/kg/day for 20 days gave a significantly higher cure rate than did a dosage of 10 mg of SbV/kg/day for 20 days[.20](#page-4-12) This dosage and duration are also recommended for other forms of New World CL. Lower doses and shorter regimens may be effective in certain geographic regions. Toxicity of SSG is discussed in Chapter 174. If toxicity does occur at the higher doses, the drug should be withheld for a few days until side effects resolve and treatment can often be resumed.

#### Amphotericin B

In patients unresponsive to SbV, amphotericin B deoxycholate is usually effective. One mg/kg doses are administered by slow intravenous infusion on alternate days. Prolonged treatment to a total of 2 to 3 g is generally required. L-amB is increasingly used to treat cutaneous CL in higher-income countries with generally good results, although there are reports of failure[.21,22](#page-4-13)

### Pentamidine

Pentamidine was as effective as pentavalent antimonials for curing CL caused by *L.(V.) panamensis* or *L.*(*V.*) *guyanensis* in Brazil, Colombia, French Guiana, and Suriname. Recent trials in Colombia have shown that 2 mg/kg given intramuscularly every other day for seven doses or 3 mg/kg given every other day for four doses cured 72 out of 75 (96%) evaluable patients[.23](#page-5-0) The injections were well tolerated, and no significant side effects were noted. It is, however, less effective than pentavalent antimonials for CL caused by *L.*(*V.*) *braziliensis.*

#### Azoles

Ketoconazole yielded a 70% cure rate in patients with CL caused by *L.*(*V.*) *panamensis* in Guatemala; however, it is less effective for *L.*(*V.*) *braziliensis,* curing only 7 out of 23 (30%) infections[.24](#page-5-1) Fluconazole has been studied in *L.*(*V.*) *braziliensis* and *L.*(*V.*) *guyanensis* treatment with poor effect.[25,26](#page-5-2) A systematic review of azoles for the treatment of leishmaniasis found an overall healing rate of 49% for *L.(V.) braziliensis* infections and 89% for *L. mexicana*.

#### Miltefosine

Oral miltefosine is approved by the FDA for the treatment of CL caused by *L.*(*V.*) *braziliensis, L.* (*V.*) *guyanesis,* and *L.*(*V.*) *panamensis* and ML due to *L.* (*V.*) *braziliensis.* Current WHO recommendations include miltefosine at 2.5 mg/kg day orally for 28 days (maximum dose of 150 mg daily).[80](#page--1-1) Miltefosine is also 75% effective against CL caused by *L.*(*V.*) *braziliensis* acquired in Bahia, Brazil[,32](#page--1-6) 70% effective in Colombia, and 70% in Bolivia[,27](#page-5-3) but only 53% effective in Guatemala[.31](#page--1-5) The response of *L.*(*V.*) *braziliensis* to miltefosine treatment may vary depending on the geographic area.

#### Local Agents

The risk of ML from *Viannia* infection is observed to be less in Latin American countries above Costa Rica. Additionally, *L. mexicana* does not have an ML risk. Because of this, it may be acceptable to treat CL acquired north of Costa Rica or CL caused by *Leishmania* species not *Viannia* subgenus with topical therapy. Intralesional injections of SbV, accepted therapy for CL in the Old World, have not seen wide use in the Americas. There are insufficient data with which to base recommendations.

Thermotherapy has been used in Colombia, Guatemala, Mexico, and Peru with success (overall efficacy 73%) and could be a treatment consideration for lower-risk ML-associated species.[28](#page-5-4)

Topical application of paromomycin formulations has been evaluated in Ecuador and Colombia. In Ecuador, an open, nonrandomized trial of 15% paromomycin with 12% methyl benzethonium chloride in white paraffin cured 90% of 52 patients[.29](#page-5-5) In Colombia, another open, non-randomized trial of 15% paromomycin with 5% methyl benzethonium chloride combined with parenteral meglumine antimoniate at 20 mg SbV/kg daily for 7 days cured 18 out of 20 (90%) patients[.30](#page-5-6)

#### **Mucosal Leishmaniasis**

Current WHO recommendations for the treatment of ML include 20 mg SbV/kg/day intramuscularly or intravenously for 30 days, SbV plus oral pentoxifylline at 400 mg/8 h for 30 days[,31](#page-5-7) amphotericin B deoxycholate at 0.7 to 1 mg/kg by infusion every other

![](_page_4_Picture_3.jpeg)

**Fig. 104.4.4** Relapsed New World cutaneous leishmaniasis postantimonial treatment. (Courtesy Glenn Wortmann, Washington Hospital Center, Washington, DC.)

<span id="page-4-14"></span>day up to 25 to 45 doses, or liposomal amphotericin B 2 to 3 mg/ kg daily by infusion up to a total dose of 40 to 60 mg/kg. Miltefosine at 2.5 to 3.3 mg/kg/day orally for 28 days was found to be efficacious in an open-label study in Bolivia.[32](#page-5-8) The cure rate for the 36 patients who had "mild" disease (i.e., affecting nasal skin and nasal mucosa) was 83%; for the 36 patients with more extensive disease (involving the palate, pharynx, and larynx), the cure rate was 58%.

In patients with advanced ML, adequate nutrition must be ensured, and destructive or obstructive lesions may require ventilatory support. Plastic surgery may be required after parasitologic cure in those with extensive tissue destruction from espundia.

## **Diffuse Cutaneous Leishmaniasis**

Venezuelan diffuse CL often improves after initial treatment with SbV, although relapse is invariable; patients who relapse often do not respond to additional SbV treatment. Miltefosine produces a dramatic clinical and parasitologic response in patients with diffuse CL, and improvement continued during drug administration, but patients relapse and develop new lesions when treatment is stopped.[33](#page-5-9) Continuous use or intermittent treatments may be useful.

# **PROGNOSIS**

Cutaneous lesions usually heal (complete epithelialization) within 3 months after initiation of treatment with SbV, although large ulcers may require longer [\(Fig. 104.4.4](#page-4-14) shows the appearance of relapsed infection). Mucosal disease caused by *L.(V.) braziliensis,* which may appear many years after the primary cutaneous lesion has resolved, is progressive unless treated. The risk of espundia may be reduced in persons whose primary cutaneous lesions are adequately treated. Diffuse CL is characteristically a relapsing or chronically progressive disease.

# **PREVENTION AND CONTROL**

Vaccines and chemoprophylactic drugs are not available. Because of the forest location of vectors and reservoirs, control of American CL and ML is not possible. The only exception is uta, which, because of its domiciliary nature, can be minimized by spraying houses with insecticides. Insect repellents, long-sleeved shirts, and fine-mesh bed nets may reduce the risk of infection for individual travelers. Permethrin-impregnated clothing is also effective. In a study of Colombian military personnel in an endemic area for 6.6 weeks and followed for an additional 12 weeks, 4 out of 143 (3%) soldiers wearing permethrin-impregnated uniforms acquired disease, whereas 18 out of 143 (13%) soldiers who did not wear impregnated uniforms acquired disease[.34](#page-5-10)
