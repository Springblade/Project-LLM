# *Mycobacterium marinum* Infection: Fish Tank Granuloma

Francisco Vega-López

### **KEY FEATURES**

- This condition is suspected after a history of exposure by occupation or leisure to water in a fish tank, swimming pool, aquaria, vivarium, or seawater with infected fish and/or amphibians.
- Clinical signs manifest 2 to 8 weeks after exposure to infected fish or water. The "sporotrichoid" distribution of non-healing nodules frequently involves fingers, hands, and the rest of the upper limbs unilaterally and with proximal dissemination.
- Severe and chronic nodular lesions unresponsive to treatment occur in the immunocompromised host.
- Investigate and rule out the possibility of sporotrichosis, cutaneous leishmaniasis, sarcoidosis, and cutaneous tuberculosis, among other differential diagnoses.
- The history of exposure, the typical clinical skin lesions, and the variable presence of granulomatous inflammation on histology are the gold standards for diagnosis. The isolation or identification of *Mycobacterium marinum* in the laboratory, which can be difficult, confirms the etiologic diagnosis.
- *M. marinum* is a multi-drug-resistant organism; however, cure can be achieved in ≈85% of cases with combinations of rifampin, ethambutol, tetracyclines, macrolides, fluoroquinolones, amikacin, or imipenem. Relapse is not uncommon.

### INTRODUCTION

Mycobacterium marinum is an environmental mycobacterium ubiquitous in fresh, brackish, and sea waters. It infects more than 150 species of fish and also causes clinical illness in frogs, eels, oysters, toads, and snakes. It is responsible for human granulomatous cutaneous infection through direct inoculation into the skin. Currently, it is an uncommon human disease manifested sporadically, and most cases respond to treatment with combinations of antimycobacterial drugs.

### **EPIDEMIOLOGY**

The disease is uncommon and usually presents as sporadic individual cases, although outbreaks involving dozens of individuals have been reported after contact and exposure to a common source of infection. It can be acquired in fresh or sea water. Humans acquire the infection most commonly when handling fresh water in aquaria

or when harvesting, and infection represents an occupational risk for biologists, veterinary doctors, and fishermen.

### NATURAL HISTORY, PATHOGENESIS, AND PATHOLOGY

Inoculation of *M. marinum* takes place through skin abrasion or injury while handling infected fish or water. Skin lesions appear at the inoculation site 2 to 8 weeks after introduction and tend to spread proximally on the affected limb. Sporotrichoid nodules may develop. Spontaneous resolution has been observed, and relapse is not uncommon after weeks or months of apparently successful treatment. The clinical features can last for many years if left untreated. Glycin-rich proteins have been identified as contributors to bacterial virulence, and corresponding pathogenic loci have been determined for *M. marinum*. The genomic diversity of *M. marinum* has been associated with variation in host response and pathogenicity.

Histologic examination may reveal chronic, non-specific inflammation or a mixed inflammatory picture with granuloma formation. Typical advanced cases may reveal well-formed epithelioid tuberculoid granulomas, and intra-cellular acid-fast bacilli can be observed by special stains in a small proportion of cases.

### **CLINICAL FEATURES**

A single erythematous papule or small nodule, with a smooth or warty surface, may appear at the inoculation site, commonly on the dorsal aspect of a finger. Dissemination takes place during the following weeks, and nodular lesions can be observed following the lymphatic track (Fig. 64.1). The lesions are commonly asymptomatic but may become tender and pyogenic if suprainfection occurs (Fig. 64.2). Extensive skin involvement or frank dissemination can occur in immunocompromised individuals. Septic arthritis, nose and facial mutilation, and nodular vasculitis have been described.<sup>2</sup>

#### DIAGNOSIS

The diagnosis is usually made on clinical grounds, taking into account appropriate exposures, clinical manifestations, duration, histology, and microbiology. Polymerase chain reaction (PCR) assays are available.

### TREATMENT

Therapy usually involves clarithromycin and ethambutol or rifampin (Fig. 64.3) for 1 to 2 months after resolution. Treatment courses usually are in the 3- to 4-month range. Relapse can occur.<sup>3</sup> Simple localized disease may be successfully treated with single agents (clarithromycin, trimethoprim–sulfamethoxazole, or doxycycline), although most experts would usually treat with two agents.
