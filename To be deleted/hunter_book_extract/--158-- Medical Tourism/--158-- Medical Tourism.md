# **158** Medical Tourism

*Stephen T. Green*

## KEY FEATURES

- • Medical tourism is the practice of traveling outside of a patient's local area for the sole purpose of accessing medical services, which may include international travel.
- • Its popularity continues to grow.
- • Associated risks include all the issues common to practitioners of international travel medicine, including a range of tropical conditions, with additional bespoke risks related to the medical care itself.
- • Quality control, risk, and safety are key issues but difficult to control for, especially if the health care provider is not engaging in independent holistic accreditation or some similarly robust external review process.
- • Patients can return to their home country with on-going health care and other needs related to their treatment and problems resulting purely from having traveled overseas.
- • The range of services available through medical tourism continues to grow.
- • New risks and problems are identified from time to time.
- • Medical tourism throws up a range of ethical and legal issues which merit discussion.
- • Synonyms: medical travel, health care tourism.

#### **INTRODUCTION**

Throughout history people have traveled purely for reasons of accessing health care. The Ancient Greeks were quite possibly the first to lay the foundations of a comprehensive medical tourism network when, in honor of Aesculapius, the god of medicine, they erected the Asculepia Temples, which became perhaps the world's first organized health centers and to which people traveled from all over the ancient world. After this, when in 1248 AD the Mansuri Hospital was built in Egypt, it became the largest and most advanced hospital in the world of its time, with a capacity to accommodate 8000 people and was a magnet for foreigners seeking health care, regardless of race or religion. During the 16th century, Europe's wealthy elite rediscovered Roman baths and flocked to spa towns such as Bath, St. Moritz, Ville d'Eaux, Aachen, and Baden Baden to "take the waters" based on the (often unsubstantiated) promise that it would prove beneficial for a vast variety of health conditions.

Toward the end of the 20th century, several factors served to increasingly internationalize the delivery of medical services to patients and have influenced consumption and production of health care services to a much greater extent than has ever been the case before. These factors include:

- • A growth in the numbers of patients willing to cross national borders
- • Advances in medical technology

- • Increased interest of the business world in health care–related business and access to capital funding
- • Greater attention to and by national and independent health care regulatory regimes
- • Greater movement of health care professionals of all types across national borders

This phenomenon, known as *medical tourism* (or sometimes *medical travel*), has arisen for many reasons and has a number of manifestations. First, patients can travel from developed countries to less well-developed countries because of, among other things, high costs of accessing health care in the home country. Second, affluent patients will travel from developing countries to developed or other developing countries seeking medical treatments that are considered to be inadequate, unsafe, or unavailable in their home countries. Third, patients can move from developed countries to other developed countries, such as the cross-border flow of patients occurring in the Western European Union. This chapter concentrates mainly on the first manifestation.

Aside from new patterns of health care consumption coming into being, medical tourism has also given rise to new risks, with these risks emerging both out of the fact that the individual is undergoing medical/surgical treatment and is also an international traveler. Medical tourism therefore represents a means by which:

- • Human beings will be induced to travel to potentially unfamiliar places where they might potentially come into contact with unfamiliar diseases, including tropical diseases
- • Micro-organisms and antimicrobial resistance can be transported across international borders, some of which might be unusual and unfamiliar to medical staff in the country of origin
- • New challenges are generated for domestic health care provider systems, such as the UK's National Health Service
- • New ethical and quality assurance dilemmas are generated
- • Patients might also enjoy an overseas holiday while receiving medical treatment

#### **SERVICES AVAILABLE VIA MEDICAL TOURISM**

From a perusal of marketing materials, both in print and on the Internet, it is apparent that the range of investigations and treatments available around the world for prospective medical tourists to access are very wide, including, for example:

- • Health check-ups and diagnostics
- • Cosmetic surgery: liposuction, dermabrasion, breast, face, and Botox injections
- • Cardiology/cardiac surgery: coronary revascularization, percutaneous transluminal septal myocardial ablation, and even cardiac transplantation
- • Dentistry: cosmetic, reconstructive, and implants
- • Orthopedic surgery: hip replacement and resurfacing and knee replacement
- • Bariatric surgery: gastric bypass and gastric banding
- • Fertility/reproductive system: in vitro fertilization (IVF), preconception gender selection, and transgender reassignment
- • Organ, cell, and tissue transplantation: renal and hemi-liver transplantation
- • Eye surgery: refractive surgery such as LASIK and cataract surgery

- • Stem cell therapy
- • Opiate and alcohol detoxification services
- • Spa services
- • Complementary and traditional medicine services: Ayurvedic medicine and Chinese traditional medicine

Not all of these procedures are legal or acceptable everywhere in the world (see later).

#### **STATISTICS ON MEDICAL TOURISM**

No totally reliable official or unofficial estimates exist of the total number of medical tourists and their origin.[1](#page-3-0) A report from 2007 authored by the leading international consultancy Deloitte estimated the number of U.S. citizens leaving that country in search of treatment to be 750,000 in 2007, with the suggestion that this number would reach somewhere between 3 and 5 million by 2010[.2](#page-3-1) It has been estimated that U.S.-origin medical tourists are thought to represent roughly 9% of the total worldwide number of medical tourists,[3](#page-3-2) so this would suggest that the total worldwide figures could lie somewhere between 30 and 50 million traveling abroad for reasons of medical tourism annually. Although difficult to verify, some support for these numbers comes from reports that a single hospital in Bangkok, Thailand, admitted close to around 430,000 patients in 2003, with that hospital admitting 93,000 Arab patients alone, and given that even the most conservative estimates of inward medical tourism to India place the annual number of medical tourists at 150,000, and the equivalent figure for Singapore is around 400,000, the numbers appear not to be insignificant[.4](#page-3-3) Having said that, a large U.S.-based study in 2010 that surveyed 45 companies representing around 70% of the market found that they had referred around 13,500 U.S. patients for health care overseas, a number far lower than prior reports of over 500,000[.5](#page-3-4)

Research related to medical tourism, especially in relation to economically important matters, definitely has commercial importance, and at the time of writing access to accurate data and scientifically sound analysis remains elusive[.1](#page-3-0)

#### **LOCATIONS FOR MEDICAL TOURISM SERVICES**

As a general rule, and ignoring the issue of standards of care and quality, the cost of accessing health care is much less in Asia, South and Central America, and Africa. This is undoubtedly one, but not the only, driver for the growth of medical tourism.

Looking at the phenomenon from the standpoint of its relevance to tropical and infection medicine, any global map of medical tourism destinations must include:

- • Asia, especially India, Malaysia, Singapore, Korea, and Thailand
- • The Middle East, especially Dubai and Jordan
- • South Africa
- • South and Central America, especially Brazil, Costa Rica, and Mexico
- • Eastern Europe, especially Hungary, Poland, and Ukraine
- • Southern Europe and the Mediterranean, especially Turkey, Cyprus, and Malta

In some countries, hospitals have been built specifically to cater for and develop the medical tourism market, with varying degrees of success.[6](#page-3-5)

Although there is no doubt that medical tourism services are being made available in the countries mentioned earlier, as well as in many others not mentioned, estimates of numbers of medical tourists making use of the services in those countries that are based on industry sources may be biased and inaccurate. For this reason, it is vital that awareness of the potential risks is raised among the general population in countries sourcing medical tourists so that decisions to take this route to accessing treatment can be made on the basis of the best available data and advice, and appropriate pre-travel steps taken (see later).

### **INFECTION-RELATED RISKS**

There is clearly a potential for the spread of infection associated with at least some of these services.

- • Some procedures carry with them the risk of hemorrhage and the requirement for blood product transfusions, with all the recognized risks of acquiring blood-borne viruses such as HIV[7](#page-3-6) and other pathogens, including tropical diseases[.8](#page-3-7)
- • The cross-border transmission of antimicrobial resistance as a consequence of undergoing surgery and other procedures overseas has been described.[9](#page-3-8) This has included issues with New Delhi Metallo-beta-lactamase-containing organisms.[10](#page-3-9)
- • Transmission of serious viral infections at the time of transplantation have been described, such as rabie[s11](#page-3-10) and West Nile virus[.12](#page-3-11)

If such potentially devastating adverse events are to be avoided, it is vital that those hospitals and clinics providing medical tourism services, and the staff working within them, maintain the highest standards of clinical governance; however, ensuring that this is and remains the case presents a challenge (see later).

A second area of relevance to infection medicine is the clear need for pre-travel preventive medicine to play a part in the process. Some countries (e.g.,India,Thailand, Brazil) where medical tourism services are being advertised and accessed are the very same countries in which people who would be planning to travel to them for other reasons, such as vacation or business, would ordinarily be told to seek the advice of an expert in travel health due to the well-recognized issues around malaria and other tropical (and potentially preventable) diseases that are extant. In particular, non–vaccine-preventable diseases such as dengue, chikungunya, and Zika are not uncommon in some medical tourism provider countries and obviously merit advice regarding mechanical and chemical protection, and issues like eating and drinking safely and safer sex are just as relevant as in any other species of international traveler.

A third area involves patients who are seeking surgical services overseas, as, depending on their destination, it may be advisable for them to, for example, receive pre-travel vaccination against hepatitis B or even rabies or yellow fever. They may also require advice regarding, say, the prevention of deep venous thrombosis during long-distance air flights. All of this would necessitate health care professionals in the countries of origin, such as in the UK or the United States, to be proactive in this process.

#### **QUALITY CONTROL, SAFETY, AND RISK**

Although few would disagree that providing health care, especially of an adequate standard, is of overwhelming importance in any society, it must also be acknowledged that it is a complex and challenging process with medical, dental, social, political, ethical, business, and financial ramifications. For example, if one takes the example of infection control in a hospital's ward, outpatient clinic, kitchen, mortuary, laboratory, or blood bank, this cannot be accomplished without there being demonstrably good governance in place throughout the organization.

Medical tourism compounds these difficulties, as only through independent and transparent external scrutiny is it possible to establish if an individual hospital or clinic, and its staff, are fit for purpose and functioning in a safe way. Worldwide, independent external assessment is increasingly being used to regulate, improve, and market health care providers in the medical tourism field, with the most common models employed being holistic accreditation, peer review, statutory inspection, ISO certification, and evaluation (usually internal) against the "business excellence" framework.[13](#page-3-12)

The most robust model, from a clinical perspective, is widely accepted to be holistic accreditation. Accreditation has been defined thus: "Accreditation is usually a voluntary program, sponsored by a non-governmental agency (NGO), in which trained external peer reviewers evaluate a health care organization's compliance with pre-established performance standards. Accreditation addresses organizational, rather than individual practitioner, capability or performance. Unlike licensure, accreditation focuses on continuous improvement strategies and achievement of optimal quality standards, rather than adherence to minimal standards intended to assure public safety."[14](#page-3-13) Holistic accreditation systems are structured so as to provide objective measures for the external evaluation of quality and quality management in a hospital or clinic, and hence provide an independent hands-on verification of quality, the results and conclusions of which can be referred to by interested parties such as the general public, governments, third-party payers such as insurance companies, and others. Examples of such independent accreditation schemes include JCI (Joint Commission International) from the United States, QHA Trent Accreditation from the UK, and Accreditation Canada International. Currently, it is not compulsory for private-sector health care providers such as hospitals and clinics to go through independent accreditation of any type anywhere in the world, including in the UK, and without some form of reputable external scrutiny in place it is challenging to see how interested parties can have any true idea of whether or not a hospital or clinic they might be contemplating using is safe and fit for purpose.

Complaints may sometimes arise during the delivery of health care—for example, patients may be the victim of medical negligence or a medical accident—and for medical tourists (who have had their care within a foreign legal jurisdiction), obtaining a satisfactory resolution of a problem of this type can be very challenging, if not impossible. In some provider countries, such as Malaysia and Singapore, doctors routinely carry medical indemnity from organizations such as the Medical Protection Society from the UK, which helps protect patients should they take successful legal action against a doctor, as they will be appropriately remunerated. However, in some countries, such as Thailand or India, it is not routine for doctors to subscribe to a medical indemnity organization,[4](#page-3-3) and hence medical tourists might not enjoy the same level of protection in the event of an iatrogenic injury as they would in their home country.

The lack of legal safeguards in particular countries can sometimes be made use of by patients, such as happens with the growing use of stem cell injections to treat a wide variety of conditions without a strong scientific evidence base to justify their usage in such settings, and pre-conception sex selection, which is not legal in the UK but is tolerated in the United States[.15](#page-3-14)

Importantly, deaths have occurred among medical tourists. In 2005 the wife of a prominent African politician died after undergoing liposuction in Spain, and one UK resident who went to the United States specifically to receive silicone injections into her buttocks for cosmetic purposes died of complications—the procedure is not practiced in the UK.[16](#page-3-15)

Specific issues have arisen from time to time, such as the advent of Zika virus and its effects on assisted conception/IVF medical tourism.[17](#page-3-16)

#### **THE RETURNING MEDICAL TOURIST**

Upon returning home, patients may require routine-type follow-up after, for example, undergoing surgery such as the fitting of a gastric band. Sometimes the medical tourism provider will make arrangements for this to happen in the patient's home country, but sometimes they will not.

Furthermore, problems can occur. For example, if a person returns home from a period overseas during which they had been a medical tourist and they have subsequently become ill, they must be fully assessed to establish if they are:

- • Ill because of the surgery itself
- • Ill because of a complication of the surgery (e.g., a wound infection)
- • Ill because of another procedure they underwent (e.g., a blood transfusion)
- • Ill because of the journey by air (e.g., deep venous thrombosis ± pulmonary embolus)
- • Ill as a result of having visited a tropical or sub-tropical country and acquired a condition endemic to that country, such as malaria, typhoid, Zika, or a rickettsial disease
- • Ill but not related in any way to any of the earlier points

Such situations can lead to difficulty for patients.In 2018 people who are entitled to UK National Health Service (NHS) care remain in the fortunate position that they are entitled to access that care even where problems occurred as a result of their having undergone treatment overseas as a medical tourist. The author is aware of examples where a patient returned with a serious wound infection after orthopedic surgery and another who acquired acute hepatitis B during a renal transplant. In both cases on-going care was provided free at the point of care by the NHS.

In contrast, in parts of the world where a patient has no consistent entitlement to access socialized medicine (such as in the United States), a returning medical traveler who subsequently develops a problem once they are home may be left in considerable difficulties, both medically and financially, and with no chance of seeking correction of their problem or redress from the organization and doctors who provided the care overseas. There are a number of examples of this having occurred in the press.

#### **GENERAL CONCERNS**

Medical tourism remains an area that is relatively understudied by the scientifically oriented (as opposed to the "commercially oriented") community.

In their 2011 Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD) report, Lunt et al. expressed concerns and identified gaps in the knowledge base that strongly merit attention. Among these are[18:](#page-3-17)

- • Significant gaps in the research evidence.
- • A lack of systematic data concerning health services trade, both overall and at a disaggregated level in terms of individual modes of delivery, and of specific countries. This is both in terms of the trade itself, as well as its implications.
- • Mechanisms are needed that help us track the balance of trade around medical tourism on a regular basis. The evidence base is scant to enable us to assess who benefits and who loses out at the level of system, program, organization and treatment.
- • There is the possibility of resources being taken away from the domestic population and invested into private hospitals.
- • The lack of data is significant if countries are to keep fully informed about the significance (potential or actual) of medical tourism for their health systems.
- • There is scant evidence on long- or short-term follow-up of patients returning to their home countries after treatments at the range of destinations.

At the time of writing, these and many other issues remain to be resolved.

### **CONCLUSIONS**

If an individual patient is planning to become a medical tourist and that trip is known about by an expert health care team in advance and planned for, then from the purely individual medical standpoint, this would be the ideal situation, as proper planning and action can be put in place. For example, a patient planning to undergo cosmetic surgery in a country where hepatitis B is highly endemic and malaria is present can be appropriately vaccinated and prophylaxed in advance. Likewise, if a hemodialysis patient wishes to go overseas to access a kidney transplant that might otherwise have been impossible for them to obtain in their home country, then steps could be taken prospectively by the home medical team to improve the outcome.

However, work has been undertaken to study UK doctors' attitudes to working with UK-based patients who wish to travel as medical tourists to access renal and hemi-liver transplants, including in relation to infection prevention and control.[19,20](#page-3-18) This and other work have revealed that it is fair to say that some services are happier to assist patients with this endeavor than others.

Indeed, some doctors and others within the health care professions and wider society continue to have deep objections to being involved in medical tourism, and there are a large number of ongoing challenging ethical issues around medical tourism. These include:

- • Rewarded organ donation
- • Elderly women in their sixties being enabled to carry babies to term
- • The use of surrogacy
- • Pre-natal gender selection for non-medical reasons
- • Unproven claims regarding the value of stem cell injections in a wide range of condition[s21](#page-3-19)
- • The practice of traveling to Switzerland from the UK with the sole intent of accessing euthanasia (this is legal in Switzerland but illegal in the UK)

This is not an exhaustive list.

*Primum non nocere* can be a challenging maxim to apply to medical tourism, but as its prevalence grows, it is increasingly something that health care workers and health care provider systems are going to have to confront. For some patients and some health care systems it has the power to provide answers for problems that might otherwise seem intractable.
