## Dracunculiasis

*Donald R. Hopkins*

#### KEY FEATURES

- • Human dracunculiasis manifests as an ulcer on the skin, with the nematode *Dracunculus medinensis* protruding through the lesion.
- • It is an incapacitating disease of poor residents in rural areas without access to safe drinking water. It severely affects agricultural productivity and school attendance.
- • Infection occurs after ingestion of freshwater copepods or inadequately cooked aquatic animals that contain the larval worm. Acute manifestations begin about 1 year after infection with the formation of a skin blister, accompanied by redness and irritation (burning sensation); this is usually preceded by fever and allergic symptoms, including intense generalized itching.
- • The intense skin irritation prompts the patient to seek relief by immersing the lesion in water. The blister breaks and an ulcer-like lesion develops with the anterior end of the parasite exposed. This allows the adult female worm to discharge larvae into the water.
- • Lesions occur on the lower extremities, including the ankle or foot in about 90% of cases, but the parasite can exit from anywhere on the body.
- • Abscesses can occur if the worm is broken during manual extraction or if they die before exiting the body and calcify. Chronic manifestations of arthritis, synovitis, and muscle and tendon contractures with resultant ankylosis of the limb are rare.
- • Synonyms include Guinea worm disease, dracontiasis, and dracunculosis.

#### **INTRODUCTION**

Dracunculiasis is caused by the nematode *Dracunculus medinensis,* and is a disabling disease of poor rural residents in parts of three countries in Africa[.1,2](#page-3-0) *D. medinensis* has been known since ancient Egyptian times, and the life cycle of the parasite was fully described by Alexei Fedechenko in 1870[.3](#page-3-1) Infection manifests with the emergence through a lesion on the skin of 2- to 3-foot (≈1 m)-long worms; it has an enormous adverse impact on agricultural production and school attendance. Infection is close to being eradicated.

#### **EPIDEMIOLOGY AND ERADICATION**

During the nineteenth and twentieth centuries, dracunculiasis was common in much of southern Asia and in North, West, and East Africa. The Dracunculiasis Eradication Program began in 1980; in 1986 an estimated 3.5 million cases occurred annually in India, Pakistan, and 16 African countries[.4](#page-3-2) Transmission of dracunculiasis in Yemen was confirmed during 1994, and the World Health Organization (WHO) declared the Central African Republic to have indigenous transmission in 1996, making it the twentieth endemic country.[5](#page-3-3) South Sudan, the twenty-first endemic country, became independent of Sudan in 2011. By 2017, only 30 cases were reported, from Chad and Ethiopia [\(Fig. 118.1](#page-1-0)).[1,2](#page-3-0) Disease in Asia was eradicated in 1997.

People usually become infected when they drink water containing tiny freshwater copepods called *cyclops* or *water fleas,* which act as intermediate hosts and harbor infective larvae[.6](#page-3-4) Since 2012 there has been increasing evidence of an unusual life cycle of *D. medinensis* in Chad, involving a paratenic host in fish, frogs, or other aquatic animals and predominately affecting domestic dogs, with occasional infections of humans who eat infected, inadequately cooked aquatic animals[.7,8](#page-3-5)

When ingested copepods are killed by the digestive juices in the stomach, the larvae are released and move to the small intestine, where they penetrate the intestinal wall and migrate to the connective tissues of the thorax[.6](#page-3-4) Male and female larvae mature and mate 60 to 90 days after infection. Over the next 10 to 14 months, gravid female worms mature, reaching lengths of 70 to 100 cm (2–3 feet), and slowly migrate to the surface of the body [\(Fig. 118.2\)](#page-1-1), where they become visible through ulceration. On contact with freshwater, powerful contractions cause a loop of the worm's uterus to break and discharge a swarm of motile larvae. Contraction of the worm and discharge of larvae may be repeated if the lesion is again submerged in water, until the entire brood of larvae is discharged. Motile free-swimming larvae are ingested whole by copepods and mature in the body cavity in about 2 weeks. Stagnant sources of drinking water such as ponds; cisterns; pools in dried-up river beds; and shallow, unprotected, hand-dug wells commonly harbor copepods and are the usual sites of infection transmission.

Seasonality varies according to location. In endemic countries in the Sahel area of Africa (Chad, Ethiopia, South Sudan), transmission usually peaks during the rainy season at mid-year (May– September). This is because stagnant surface sources of water are more common in these areas during the 5- to 6-month-long rainy season. The seasonal emergence of the worm often coincides with harvest or planting seasons, and thus significantly affects agricultural productivity and school attendance. Most cases usually occur in older children and working-age adults.

#### **NATURAL HISTORY, PATHOGENESIS, PATHOLOGY, AND CLINICAL FEATURES**

Infected people remain asymptomatic for approximately a year after infection, until the mature female worm approaches the skin and forms a painful papule in the dermis. This papule can become a blister within 24 hours or may enlarge for several days before blistering [\(Fig. 118.3\)](#page-2-0). The blister is accompanied by redness and induration, and is usually preceded by systemic symptoms of low-grade fever and allergic symptoms (erythema, urticarial rash, intense pruritus, dizziness, nausea, vomiting). The lesion produces intense irritation and burning, inducing the patient to seek relief by immersing the affected limb in water, where the blister breaks, allowing the adult worm to discharge larvae into the water ([Fig. 118.4](#page-2-1)).

Eighty to ninety percent of lesions occur on the lower extremities, including the ankle or foot. However, worms can exit from

More than one worm may emerge from a given patient either simultaneously or sequentially over a period of weeks or months. As the worm emerges through the skin lesion, the affected person pulls it out slowly and carefully (because of inflammation and pain), usually by winding a few centimeters of the worm each day on a small stick. This very painful process may last many weeks.

Pain and other symptoms may lessen with the rupture of the blister, but pyogenic organisms invariably invade the superficial lesion and worm tract and aggravate the condition (see [Fig. 118.4](#page-2-1)). If the worm breaks during extraction and the remaining part retracts into the tissue, an intense inflammatory reaction occurs, with pain, swelling, and cellulitis along the worm tract and usually the formation of an abscess. The reported period of incapacitation ranges from 2 to 16 weeks (average 8.5 weeks[\)9–16](#page-3-6) and more than half of a village's population may be affected at the same time. In addition to the blisters and skin lesions, secondary bacterial infections can lead to sepsis, abscesses, septic arthritis, contracture of muscles near joints, or even tetanus.[17](#page-3-7)

Chronic manifestations are due to inflammation of the joints, with signs and symptoms of arthritis, synovitis,[18](#page-3-8) and muscle and tendon contractures with resultant ankylosis of the limb.[19](#page-3-9) Migration of the worms to the retroperitoneum and from the retroperitoneum to the subcutaneous tissue in the leg sometimes results in aberrant (ectopic) locations such as the pancreas, lung, periorbital tissues, testis, pericardium[,20](#page-3-10) and the spinal cord, producing compressio[n21](#page-3-11) as well as focal abscess formation.

#### **PATIENT EVALUATION, DIAGNOSIS, AND DIFFERENTIAL DIAGNOSIS**

No serodiagnostic tests are available to detect an incubating Guinea worm. Diagnosis is based on the clinical history and findings with an appropriate exposure. The blister fluid is bacteriologically sterile and initially contains polymorphonuclear leukocytes and later lymphocytes, eosinophils, and macrophages. Larvae are always present in the fluid, and white blood cells adhere to them.[6](#page-3-4) With time, the blister and worm tract often become secondarily infected.

Differentiation between human and zoonotic species of *Dracunculus* (which rarely affect humans) requires morphologic

Therefore efforts are underway to map the genome of the Guinea worm's DNA in order to ascertain the infecting parasite's species. Although there are several zoonotic species of *Dracunculus*, only *medinensis* is specific to humans. A molecular tool is now available to differentiate between *D. medinensis* and other tissue-dwelling nematodes, including other *Dracunculus* species that may rarely infect humans.[22](#page-3-12) Work on determining the genome of *D. medinensis* is ongoing at the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, Wellcome Trust Sanger Institute, and Vassar College (Eberhard ML, personal communication).

#### **TREATMENT**

There is no curative drug or vaccine against dracunculiasis. Infected people do not develop immunity. Applying wet compresses to the lesion may relieve pain during the worm's emergence. Placing an occlusive bandage on the wound keeps it clean and may help to keep the patient from contaminating sources of drinking water. Oral analgesics and anti-inflammatory medicines can be administered to alleviate pain and inflammation. Topical antiseptics or antibiotic ointment may minimize the risk of secondary bacterial infections, reduce inflammation, and permit removal of the worm by gentle traction over a number of days. Systemic antibiotics can be used in established infections. Patients usually recover completely, but repeated infections occur.

#### **PREVENTION**

Prevention of dracunculiasis includes educating the at-risk population about the disease and avoidance measures. These measures include filtering drinking water to remove copepods, preventing infected people from entering water intended for drinking, cooking aquatic animals well, and tethering infected dogs. Developing safe sources for drinking water is also a key feature of control.
