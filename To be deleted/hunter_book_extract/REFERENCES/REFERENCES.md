# **130.2** Diphyllobothriasis

*Karen A. Alroy, Robert H. Gilman*

#### **INTRODUCTION**

The broad tapeworm, *Diphyllobothrium latum,* is the most common species of *Diphyllobothrium.*[1](#page-2-0) This tapeworm is acquired by ingestion of larval stages (plerocercoid) present in raw or insufficiently cooked fish. Worldwide, other species can infect humans, such as *D. nihonkaiense* and *D. klebanovskii* found in Japan and far-eastern Siberia, respectively. Other *Diphyllobothrium* species that primarily infect piscivorous birds (*D. dendriticum*) and dogs in Alaska (*D. dalliae*) can also infect humans[.2](#page-2-1)

#### **EPIDEMIOLOGY**

*Diphyllobothrium* tapeworms are associated with cold-water regions such as Scandinavia and North America[.3](#page-2-2) Diphyllobothriasis is caused by the consumption of raw or poorly cooked fish, including raw salted or marinated fish fillets commonly eaten in Europe and South America and sushi and sashimi in Japan[.4](#page-2-3) *D. latum* is found in salmonid species and in the musculature of several fish species in North America (pike, yellow perch, walleye, and sauger), Europe, and Northern Asia (pike, perch, ruffe, and burbot).

Endemic countries of Western Europe and North America have seen decreasing trends of human diphyllobothriasis over the last 20 years[.5](#page-2-4) The decline is due to increased awareness of the disease, stricter monitoring of food fish, and higher standards of public hygiene; however, it may re-emerge due to global importation and popularity of eating raw fish.[6](#page-2-5) Diphyllobothriasis was reportable in the United States until 1982. Most North American cases have occurred in the Great Lakes region, central Canada (Manitoba), and Alaska. Between 1977 and 1981, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) estimated about 125 to 200 cases occurred in the United States.[5](#page-2-4) In 2013, five species of wild Pacific salmon were identified carrying *D. nihonkaiense,*[6](#page-2-5) and a human case in the Pacific Northwest of the United States was detected in 2015.[7](#page-2-6) Reports of diphyllobothriasis have increased around Swiss, Italian, and French lakes where raw or undercooked perch is consumed. Sporadic cases have occurred in countries previously considered disease free (Austria, Czech Republic, Belgium, the Netherlands, and Spain)[.5](#page-2-4)

Chile, Peru, Argentina, Brazil, and Ecuador have reported human infections caused by *D. pacificum* and *D. latum.*[8–10](#page-2-7) Diphyllobothriasis is frequently reported along the coast of the Sea of Japan, largely caused by *D. nihonkaiense.* Since 1970, an average of 100 cases per year have been reported in Japan.[11](#page-2-8) Prevalences of 1.0% to 3.3% have been reported in Okhotsk (Russia). Rare clinical cases have been reported in the Middle East, and there are no reliable reports from Africa and Australia[.12](#page-2-9)

## **NATURAL HISTORY, PATHOGENESIS, AND PATHOLOGY**

Unembryonated eggs are released into the stool; a single worm can produce up to 1 million eggs per day ([Fig. 130.2.1](#page-1-0)). The motile first-stage larva hatches in the water and can infect many species of copepods, a small crustacean, that is the first intermediate host[.13](#page-2-10) The larva penetrates the copepod intestinal wall and develops into the procercoid. The second intermediate host (freshwater,

<span id="page-1-0"></span>**Fig. 130.2.1** Life cycle of *Diphyllobothrium latum. D. latum* tapeworm eggs are passed in feces (1). Eggs mature (2) and release coracidia (3). After ingestion by a freshwater crustacean (the copepod first intermediate host), coracidia develop into procercoid larvae (4). When the copepod is ingested by a second intermediate host, typically minnows and other small freshwater fish, procercoid larvae migrate into the fish flesh and develop into plerocercoid larvae (5). These second intermediate fish hosts can be eaten by larger predator species (e.g., trout, perch, walleyed pike) (6). If humans eat these fish raw or undercooked, they acquire the parasite (7). Tapeworms attach to the intestinal mucosa by means of the two bilateral groves (bothria) of their scolex (8). The adults can reach more than 10 m in length, with more than 3000 proglottids. Immature eggs are discharged from the proglottids (9) and are passed in the feces. (From Centers for Disease Control and Prevention: [https://www.cdc.gov/dpdx/diphyllobothriasis/index.html.](https://www.cdc.gov/dpdx/diphyllobothriasis/index.html))

anadromous, or marine fish) ingests infected copepods, and procercoids enter host tissues and develop into the plerocercoid stage. After fish ingestion by humans, plerocercoids develop rapidly into adult tapeworms, yielding their first eggs 2 to 6 weeks later[.14](#page-2-11) Most *Diphyllobothrium* species have low specificity at the adult stage, implying that humans can become infected with parasites of carnivore mammals or fish-eating birds.[5](#page-2-4)

*Diphyllobothrium* tapeworms can grow up to 2 to 15 meters in length (3000–4000 segments). Parasites can live up to 20 years and can grow as fast as 22 cm/day. *Diphyllobothrium* are characterized by a scolex with a paired slitlike attachment groove (bothrium) on the dorsal and ventral surfaces. A proliferative zone (neck) is usually present posterior to the scolex. The remaining body (strobila) is composed of a high number of proglottids, each containing one set of genital organs of both sexes.[5](#page-2-4)

Eggs are passed in stools approximately 15 to 45 days after larvae ingestion. Tapeworm segments can also be detected in stools. Adult parasites can survive for decades[.5](#page-2-4)

# **CLINICAL FEATURES**

Although most *Diphyllobothrium* species are large and can have a mechanical effect on the host, infections are often asymptomatic. Diarrhea, discomfort, and abdominal pain are observed in about 20%. Other symptoms include fatigue, constipation, pernicious anemia, headache, and allergic reactions. Tapeworms usually attach in the ileum; rarely, the worms attach in a bile duct. Rare massive infections can result in intestinal obstruction, and migrating segments can cause cholecystitis or cholangitis.[15](#page-2-12)

Approximately 80% of all of the vitamin B12 that is ingested by the host becomes absorbed by the worm, making B12 relatively unavailable to infected individuals[.5](#page-2-4) Megaloblastic anemia can occur with prolonged or heavy *D. latum* infections and is characterized by macrocytic red cells and often associated with low platelet or white blood cell counts. A low or deficient level of vitamin B12 is observed in about 40% of *D. latum*–infected individuals; however, only 2% or less develop clinical anemia[.5](#page-2-4) *Diphyllobothrium*-associated pernicious anemia is now rarely reported.[16](#page-2-13)

Symptoms with *D. nihonkaiense* infection are generally mild[.17](#page-2-14)

## **PATIENT EVALUATION, DIAGNOSIS, AND DIFFERENTIAL DIAGNOSIS**

Human broad tapeworm diagnosis is based on finding eggs of an ovoid shape with an operculum on a narrowed pole. Species differentiation of *Diphyllobothrium* is based on the shape and size of the scolex, which is typically absent from clinical samples[.5](#page-2-4) Molecular tools are the most reliable approach to confirm *Diphyllobothrium* species; however, these are not commercially available.[18](#page-2-15)

## **TREATMENT**

A single oral dose of 10-25 mg/kg praziquantel is highly effective against *D. latum* infections. Lower doses such as 10 mg/kg can be effective against *D. pacificum*[19](#page-2-16) and *D. nihonkaiense* infections[.20](#page-2-17) A single dose of niclosamide (child <10 kg, 0.5 g; child 10-35 kg, 1 g; adults, 2 g) is an alternative.

Although cumbersome in practice, intraduodenal gastrographin (for contrast-enhanced intestinal radiographs) can be efficacious in treating large cestodes. It leads to discharge of a complete, living worm with the scolex and is suitable for species identification.[5](#page-2-4)

Infections with *Diphyllobothrium* tapeworms can be prevented by eating well-cooked fish or deep-frozen fish (at least −20°C for 7 days) or by placing the fish in a concentration of brine (12% NaCl)[.12](#page-2-9)
