# KEY FEATURES

- • Bites by venomous helodermid lizards (Gila monsters and Mexican beaded lizards of Central America) are rare: envenoming causes severe pain, swelling, hypotension, nausea, vomiting, sweating, and sometimes angioedema and evidence of myocardial effects.
- • First aid involves urgent disengagement of the animal's jaws. As no antivenom is available, treatment is supportive and symptomatic.
- • Varanid, iguanid, and agamid lizards may be capable of envenoming—notably the Komodo dragon.

# **INTRODUCTION**

Venomous salivary secretion has been demonstrated in iguanas (Iguanidae), glass/alligator lizards (Anguidae), and monitors (Varanidae)—notably the Komodo dragon (*Varanus komodoensis*), which has been responsible for human fatalities that were attributed to trauma or infection of the bite wounds[.1](#page-1-0) However, the only two lizards of proven medical importance are members of the family Helodermatidae that inhabit dry forests and deserts in western Central America[.2–4](#page-1-1) The Mexican beaded lizard or escorpión (*Heloderma horridum*) ([Fig. 137.4.1A and B\)](#page-0-0) is the larger (up to 1 m in total length and 2 kg in weight) with a relatively longer tail and a more arboreal habit. It is found in western Mexico and south to Guatemala. The Gila monster (*Heloderma suspectum*) (see Fig. [137.4.1B\)](#page-0-0), which reaches a total length of 55 cm and a weight of 1 kg, occurs in the southwestern United States (southeast Nevada, southwest Utah, southeast California, southwest New Mexico, Arizona) and adjacent areas of Mexico (Sonora and northern Sonaloa). The two species overlap in Mexico (southern Sonora and northern Sinaloa).

# **VENOM APPARATUS**

Venom from bulging multi-lobed anterior submandibular glands pools in labial gutters in the lower jaw. When threatened, the lizards open and shut their mouths to promote drooling of venomenriched saliva. When they bite and chew, venom is inoculated by the mandibular (dentary) teeth, of which the fourth to the seventh are most prominently grooved, and the maxillary teeth, which are less grooved ([Fig. 137.4.2A and B\)](#page-1-2).

# **VENOM COMPOSITION[4,5](#page-1-3)**

*Heloderma* venoms contain toxic proteases, hyaluronidase, phospholipase A2, horridum/gila toxin (a glycoprotein tissue kallikrein-like

A synthetic homologue of exendin-4, exenatide, is a high-affinity GLP-1 receptor agonist that has been developed for treatment of type 2 diabetes mellitus.

# **HELODERMA BITES**

These are virtually never accidental because helodermids are reclusive and non-aggressive animals that inhabit thinly populated rural areas. Almost exclusively, bites are inflicted on the fingers, hands, and forearms of young men who are handling or trying to catch the lizards. Alcohol consumption seems to have contributed on many occasions, as is the case with bites by pet exotic snakes. Bites may be "slashing" in type, in which the anterior

# **SYMPTOMS OF ENVENOMIN[G6–9](#page-1-4)**

Envenoming by *H. suspectum* and *H. horridum* causes identical clinical syndromes. Pain may start immediately and is described as throbbing or burning. It may radiate up the bitten limb to the shoulder, chest, and epigastrium, and is often excruciating in intensity, persisting for 24 hours or more. Swelling also develops rapidly, extending in some cases to involve the whole limb, but although it may be tense, compartment syndrome has never been described. The bite site is erythematous or cyanosed with traumatic ecchymoses and persistent bleeding, but tissue necrosis does not develop. Red lymphangitic lines extend up the limb, and regional lymph glands may become tender and enlarged. Local paresthesia, hyperesthesia, and even paralysis have been described.The earliestsystemic symptomsstart within 5 minutes of the bite: dizziness, weakness, nausea, vomiting, profuse generalized sweating, breathlessness, and weakness. Hypotension and tachycardia are commonly recorded. These symptoms may be transient or recurrent. Less commonly, there is angioedema (swelling of lips, tongue, throat, and upper airway)[,10](#page--1-0) increased secretions, chills, fever, and tinnitus.

# **INVESTIGATIONS**

Neutrophil leukocytosis is common. In exceptional cases, thrombocytopenia and mild coagulopathy have been described. Electrocardiographic changes include T-wave abnormalities, conduction defects, and, in one case, myocardial infarction and acute kidney injury were documented in a previously fit 23-year-old man[.11,12](#page--1-1) Clearly, envenoming may be life threatening but the few alleged fatalities, all reported before 1930, are difficult to attribute.

# **FIRST AID**

The longer the lizard is allowed to retain its grip and to chew, the more venomous saliva will be inoculated into the wound. The priority is to disengage, but the powerful jaws make this difficult. Pulling the animal off by its tail is quick but risks extending the bite wounds and detaching teeth. Expert opinion currently favors levering the jaws apart with a screwdriver, putting the attached lizard under the water tap, placing its four feet on the ground, or introducing some alcohol into its mouth.

# **TREATMENT**

Severe pain is relieved by local anesthetic or systemic analgesia. Opiates may be required. The wound should be explored for shed teeth, which are not detectable by radiography. The risk of infection has not been studied, but prophylactic antibiotics are not justified. However, tetanus toxoid is recommended, and the wound should be observed for evidence of sepsis. Specific antivenoms have been raised experimentally in rabbits but they are not generally available. Hypotension can be treated with intravenous fluids and, if necessary, with epinephrine or dopamine. Angioedema responds to epinephrine, antihistamine, and hydrocortisone. Otherwise, treatment is symptomatic and supportive, and the patient may be expected to recover completely in less than 1 week.
