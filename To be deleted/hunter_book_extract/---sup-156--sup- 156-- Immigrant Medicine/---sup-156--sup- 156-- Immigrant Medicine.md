## KEY FEATURES

- • Health professionals need to be aware of key health concerns of immigrants and refugees.
- • To determine the health needs of immigrants, health professionals must consider where they have lived and traveled before arriving in the destination country, as well as their underlying health status, age, and the duration of time since arrival.
- • Screening for tuberculosis, HIV, and hepatitis B is important for all migrants.
- • Standardized screening protocols can help identify common infectious diseases.
- • Non-communicable diseases such as hypertension, diabetes, and mental health conditions are common.

# **INTRODUCTION**

Almost 250 million people live outside their country of birth about 3% of the world's population. Between 1965 and 1990, the number of international migrants grew by an annual rate of 2.1%; today this rate is 2.9%. The number of foreign-born individuals living in the United States increased from just over 9 million in the 1960s to over 43 million in 2015, about 13% of the population. The proportion of foreign-born individuals from Europe has decreased, while the proportions of those from Latin America, Asia, and Africa have increased significantly during this period.[1](#page-3-0)

The health status of immigrants reflects circumstances in their birth countries, exposures and experiences during their route of migration, and the situation at their destination. Infections contracted at birth, such as hepatitis B, may not manifest until decades after migration. Infections contracted in adolescence or adulthood, such as human papillomavirus, can lie dormant until years after migration. The route of migration may increase the risk of infections such as tuberculosis (TB), malaria, or schistosomiasis by exposing individuals to more crowded conditions or to vectors and diseases not present in their region of birth. Health care providers must address infectious diseases that may be unfamiliar or that have been eliminated by immunization and public health programs in the area in which they trained.

# **PRE-DEPARTURE AND POST-ARRIVAL HEALTH ASSESSMENT**

Some immigrants may have received health screening or assessment before departure from their birth country. Although well-defined procedures for health screening pre- and post-migration to some countries exist for refugees and internationally adopted children, other groups may have received minimal or no health preparation[.2](#page-3-1) Access to health care after immigration can be highly variable. Any health professional may see an immigrant for their first contact with the health system, whether a dentist, emergency room nurse or physician, primary care provider, or school nurse.

Some screening tests should be performed routinely for all immigrants, based upon prevalence of these conditions, availability and accuracy of screening tests, existence of effective interventions once these conditions are identified, and the potential risk that not identifying these conditions poses to both the immigrant and their contacts ([Box 156.1](#page-1-0)).

The first such disease is TB. Since early this century, the largest proportion of new TB cases identified in the United States is in immigrants. Elimination of TB in the United States and many other countries depends on treating and eliminating TB where it is endemic, but also on identifying and treating latent TB infection in new arrivals[.3,4](#page-3-2)

Screening for hepatitis B also should be performed. The majority of newly identified cases of hepatitis B in the United States are in the foreign-born. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) recommends routine testing for hepatitis B infection in all immigrants from areas where the prevalence of disease is ≥2% and for U.S.-born children not immunized at birth whose parents were born where prevalence of hepatitis B infection is ≥8%[.5](#page-3-3)

Additional evaluation of new immigrants and those who have not received a thorough health assessment in the past should include a complete history and physical examination, including vital signs, hearing, vision, dental screening, and mental health assessment. Some information may not be revealed until development of a trusting relationship with health professionals, particularly when immigrants have experienced traumatic experiences or are unfamiliar with the U.S. health system and its focus on preventive strategies and health promotion.

Laboratory screening tests include complete blood count with differential (identifies anemia, possible hemoglobinopathy, eosinophilia, or other blood abnormality), urinalysis (identifies hematuria, proteinuria, or glucosuria), and lead levels for children. Immigrants should be offered the same age-appropriate screening and immunizations that are given to U.S.-born individuals. Stool for ova and parasites is no longer needed for refugees who undergo pre-departure treatment for soil-transmitted helminths, but may be appropriate for immigrants not treated before departure or who are symptomatic. Serologic tests for parasites may be needed for individuals with eosinophilia or with signs or symptoms of specific parasitic diseases. Detailed information about the diagnosis of specific parasitic infections is available elsewhere in this text.

## **INFECTIOUS DISEASES OF IMMIGRANTS**

This chapter focuses on infectious diseases that clinicians may see at any time after migration and are likely to be related to the migrant's country of origin or migration process.

#### **Febrile Illnesses**

Priority should be given to identifying illnesses that can be rapidly fatal or pose a threat to public health. Delayed diagnosis of *Plasmodium falciparum* malaria can be lethal, and undiagnosed TB or measles can lead to secondary cases.

Fever soon after immigration from malarial countries could be malaria; 95% of imported *P. falciparum* cases occur within 1 month of arrival. Fever with rash suggests dengue or Zika virus, whereas fever with rash and arthritis can indicate chikungunya virus. Early fevers can also be due to typhoid and paratyphoid,

rickettsial infections, and amebic liver abscesses. Fever months after migration can be caused by TB, primary malarial infection, or relapse of *P. vivax* and *P. ovale.* Many less common infections are associated with fever, though other accompanying signs and symptoms can suggest these diagnoses. Other febrile illnesses with short incubation periods, such as influenza or meningococcemia, can occur in immigrants exposed after migration but may be more relevant to returning travelers.[6](#page-3-4)

#### **Pulmonary**

TB is the most important pulmonary infection of immigrants and refugees (Chapter 43). All immigrants should be screened for symptoms with either an interferon-gamma release assay or a tuberculin skin test; those with positive tests should be evaluated for active TB. If there are no signs or symptoms of disease, a diagnosis of latent TB infection is appropriate, and treatment is recommended per national recommendations. Prior vaccination with bacillus Calmette–Guérin (BCG) vaccine is not a contraindication to testing for TB; interferon-gamma release assays are not affected by prior BCG and may be preferred in these circumstances. Susceptibility testing of TB isolates is important in guiding therapy, especially when immigrants are from areas of drug-resistant TB[.7](#page-3-5)

Cavitary pneumonia, localized extrapulmonary disease, or disseminated infection can also suggest histoplasmosis, coccidioidomycosis, or blastomycosis. Disease can reactivate from latent infection in the setting of an underlying condition such as AIDS. *Histoplasma capsulatum* is widely distributed in Latin America, the Caribbean, and Southeast Asia. In Africa, a variant strain, *H. capsulatum var. duboisii*, involves skin and bones rather than the lungs. Parts of Mexico and Central and South America are endemic for *Coccidioides immitis.* Paracoccidioidomycosis is endemic in southern Mexico and Central and South America. *Blastomyces dermatitidis* occurs in immigrants from Mexico, Central America, and Africa. Melioidosis, caused by *Burkholderia pseudomallei,* and paragonimiasis, caused by the lung fluke *Paragonimus westermani,* can be found in immigrants most commonly from Southeast Asia. Melioidosis is associated with chest pain but also a non-productive or productive cough with normal sputum findings. A chronic cough can suggest paragonimiasis.

Cystic lesions in the lung could be from hydatid disease caused by *Echinococcus granulosus* and should be distinguished from cavitary lesions. Immigrants from the Middle East and other sheep-raising parts of the world can harbor hydatid cysts of the lung that can reach a large size without producing symptoms.

Eosinophilia with wheezing can occur with tropical pulmonary eosinophilia (TPE), a hypersensitivity reaction of lymphatic filarial parasites that usually affects people living in the tropics of India, Southeast Asia, and certain parts of China and Africa. Peripheral eosinophilia >3000 cells/mm3 is suggestive of TPE. These patients also have high titers of anti-filarial antibodies, an absence of microfilariae in the blood, and a raised serum total IgE.

Pulmonary infiltrates in an immigrant receiving corticosteroids or other immunosuppressive medications should raise the question of *Strongyloides stercoralis* hyper-infection syndrome, even without peripheral blood eosinophilia. *Strongyloides* is able to complete its life cycle within the human host (autoinfection); an individual remains infected, often asymptomatically, for years. If the host becomes immunosuppressed, larvae multiply and disseminate widely and can lead to death if untreated[.8](#page-3-6)

# **Gastrointestinal**

*Helicobacter pylori* is prevalent in the developing world, where it is usually acquired at a young age. *H. pylori* infection can be asymptomatic, but a wide range of symptoms, including abdominal pain, weight loss, nausea, dyspepsia, vomiting, and bloating, have been attributed to it. *H. pylori* causes chronic gastritis and increases the risk of duodenal and gastric ulcers; persistent infection increases the risk of gastric cancer. Treatment is recommended for those with gastric ulcer disease or malignancy; treatment for other clinical manifestations associated with *H. pylori* infection remains controversial.[9](#page-3-7)

Infection with intestinal nematodes is common and can be associated with abdominal pain, though often it is asymptomatic. Anemia and protein deficiency due to blood loss can be seen with the hookworms *Ancylostoma duodenale* and *Necator americanus. Ascaris lumbricoides* can cause impaired nutritional status, especially in children, and *Trichuris trichiura*, pus-filled, bloody stools and rectal prolapse.

Diarrhea can be from bacterial, viral, or parasitic infections. Time since arrival, recent exposures, and specific clinical symptoms help focus the evaluation. *Giardia lamblia,* a common cause of diarrhea in children, is often asymptomatic in immigrants. Chronic diarrhea or epigastric pain, particularly in the immunosuppressed, suggests a diagnosis of *Strongyloides stercoralis.*[10](#page-3-8)

*Entamoeba histolytica* is frequently asymptomatic but has the potential to cause invasive disease, dysentery, and hepatic abscess if not diagnosed and treated. In dysentery there is blood or pus in the stool along with abdominal pain and fever. Liver abscess can present with fever, right upper quadrant pain, weight loss, hepatomegaly, and jaundice. It usually presents within several months of departure from endemic areas and frequently in young men. Most cases of amebic dysentery or liver abscess in the United States originate from Mexico, but other Latin American countries, South Africa, India, and Southeast Asia also have high rates of amebic disease.

Prolonged constipation or dysphagia among immigrants from Latin America south of the equator can indicate chronic Chagas disease caused by *Trypanosoma cruzi.* Infected individuals can have symptoms of achalasia or evidence of megaesophagus or megacolon. Infection can be diagnosed by serology and polymerase chain reaction (PCR) and is discussed in more detail in Chapter 103[.11](#page-3-9) Infection can be transmitted congenitally and through blood donation; the United States, Canada, parts of Latin and South America, and parts of Europe routinely test blood donors for infection.

Jaundice can be associated with hepatitis, schistosomiasis, or the liver fluke *Clonorchis sinensis.* Hepatitis A and B can also present with abdominal pain but can be accompanied by fatigue, nausea, and jaundice. Acute hepatitis A is unusual in older immigrants from developing countries because of prior infection. Hepatitis B and C infection can be asymptomatic and put the individual at risk for late complications of cirrhosis or hepatocellular carcinoma. Hepatitis E is rare in immigrants but is worthy of note because the case fatality rate is high in pregnant women.

## **Neurologic and Ophthalmologic**

Seizures can be caused by neurocysticercosis, TB, and, less commonly, toxoplasmosis, especially if there is co-infection with HIV. Although rare, sleeping sickness, which occurs in West Africa and is caused by *Trypanosoma brucei gambiense,* and East African trypanosomiasis, caused by *T. brucei rhodesiense,* can present as altered day–night sleeping patterns. East African trypanosomiasis is less common in migrants and presents acutely, whereas West African trypanosomiasis is more common, chronic, and should be considered years after infection.

Visual deficits can occur with onchocerciasis caused by *Onchocerca volvulus.* Loiasis can present acutely when an adult *Loa loa* worm migrates across the conjunctiva. Immigrants from Africa, the Middle East, and Asia can show evidence of trachoma, the leading cause of blindness worldwide, caused by *Chlamydia trachomatis;* acute disease is not commonly seen in immigrants to the United States.

Ocular toxocariasis is associated with eye pain, leukocoria, strabismus, and loss of visual acuity and can be mistaken for retinoblastoma. Toxoplasmosis can present with blurry vision, floaters, eye pain, conjunctivitis, and photophobia; chorioretinitis is the hallmark of this condition, especially in congenital infection. Syphilis and TB are associated with uveitis, chorioretinitis, and visual loss.

## **Cardiac**

Symptomatic atrioventricular block or sustained ventricular tachycardia in immigrants from Mexico or Central and South America suggests Chagas disease. Spain is second to the United States in having the largest number of immigrants from Latin America[,11](#page-3-9) and many of these are from *Trypanosoma cruzi*–endemic areas such as Bolivia, where there is the highest prevalence of *T. cruzi* infection[.12](#page-3-10) An estimated 10 million people are infected, and although most are asymptomatic, about 25% develop arrhythmias, heart block, or congestive heart failure years to decades after infection. Reactivation of chronic Chagas disease can occur in people with HIV or other immunosuppressive conditions.

Structural abnormalities of the heart include aortic aneurysms associated with syphilis and aortic or mitral valve abnormalities associated with rheumatic fever. Recurrent rheumatic fever can present with fatigue, fever, chest pain, and a changing or new murmur on the background of previous rheumatic valvular disease. It is sometimes indistinguishable from the clinical manifestations of endocarditis. TB can present with pericarditis and should be included on the differential of an immigrant with chest pain.

#### **Genitourinary**

Screening urinalysis is helpful in identifying glycosuria associated with diabetes; hematuria, which suggests schistosomiasi[s13](#page-3-11) and other chronic kidney diseases; and proteinuria, which could be associated with recurrent urinary tract infections, HIV, glomerulonephritis, polycystic kidney disease, or chronic kidney disease.

Painless genital ulcers occur in syphilis and granuloma inguinale, which is caused by *Klebsiella granulomatis,* seen rarely in the United States, but is not uncommon in developing countries. A disseminated rash follows the ulcer of syphilis and is usually what prompts the patient to seek medical care. Painful ulcers suggest herpes simplex or chancroid, caused by the bacteria *Haemophilus ducreyi.* The incubation period of herpes is usually a few days to a week, whereas chancroid typically presents a few days to 2 weeks after exposure.

Buboes or abscesses in the groin can indicate lymphogranuloma venereum, caused by the invasive serovar L1, L2, or L3 of *Chlamydia trachomatis.* Symptoms occur days to a month after exposure. Rectal pain and inflammation after anal sex also can be associated with this infection.

Hydroceles, acute episodes of local inflammation of the skin or lymph nodes, or periodic limb swelling suggests lymphatic filariasis, endemic in Asia, Africa, and Central and South America. Lymphatic dysfunction can also lead to lymphedema of the breast, penis, and scrotum.

Infections that can present as infertility include schistosomiasis and TB. Prior gonococcal or chlamydia infection can also be associated with inability to conceive.

#### **Dermatologic**

Erythema nodosum can occur with TB, leprosy, and dimorphic fungi. Erythema can also signify cellulitis; recurrent cellulitis is a complication of the lymphedema of lymphatic filariasis.

Ulcerative skin lesions can be caused by leishmaniasis in immigrants from the Indian subcontinent, Southwest and Central Asia, Southern Europe, the Middle East, East Africa, Central America, and South America. Less common causes of ulcerations include an ulcer with eschar from the bacteria *Bacillus anthracis* and painless, large Buruli ulcers usually seen on the extremities from *Mycobacterium ulcerans.*

The nematode *L. loa* can cause erythematous, pruritic, occasionally painful subcutaneous swelling on the extremities. *Paragonimus,* usually non-*westermani,* can cause migratory swellings or firm, mobile, and tender subcutaneous nodes, often in the lower abdominal and inguinal regions. The trematode *Fasciola* is associated with larger, up to 5 cm, subcutaneous nodules. Onchocerciasis presents with depigmentation, severe itching, and subcutaneous nodules. Areas of depigmentation can also be seen with leprosy and yaws.

Superficial migratory lesions include larva currens, caused by infection with *Strongyloides stercoralis,* and cutaneous larva migrans, usually seen on the feet, buttocks, or abdomen and caused by dog and cat hookworms. Pruritus and excoriations from scratching are typical of onchocerciasis, scabies, and pinworms. Scabies mites burrow into the webs of fingers and toes, the wrists and backs of elbows, the knees, and around the waist and umbilicus and can cause characteristic linear lesions. An itchy rectal area suggests pinworms[.14](#page-3-12)

#### **NON-INFECTIOUS DISEASES OF IMMIGRANTS**

Fatigue, bruising, and non-healing sores can suggest blood disorders, including anemias and thalassemias, particularly among people from the Mediterranean, Africa, and Asia. Some of these blood disorders are genetic, whereas others are caused by nutritional disorders such as iron, B12, or folate deficiency or chronic diseases such as hookworm infestation, HIV, lead intoxication, kidney disease, or malignancy. Immigrants are likely to bear a disproportionate burden of disease due to infection-associated cancers, such as hepatoma from chronic hepatitis B and C, carcinoma of the cervix caused by human papillomavirus, Epstein–Barr virus– associated Burkitt's lymphoma, human herpesvirus-8–associated Kaposi's sarcoma, and HIV-associated lymphomas.

Malnutrition and stunting of growth can be severe in immigrant children and refugees as a result of food deprivation and infection. Malabsorption can result from intestinal protozoan infections or, rarely, tropical sprue; lactose intolerance is common among African and certain Asian immigrant groups. Immigrants can present with specific nutritional disorders such as bowing of the legs in children or osteomalacia in adults with vitamin D deficiency, xerophthalmia secondary to vitamin A deficiency, endemic goiter associated with iodine deficiency, or acrodermatitis with zinc deficiency.

Depression and stress are common among immigrants who are adapting to a new culture and language. Post-traumatic stress disorder and other psychiatric problems are seen in refugees, especially those who have experienced torture, rape, and other physical trauma in war-torn countries. Those who care for immigrants may find that disclosures of trauma occur only after development of a trusting relationship with the health care provider. Many validated screening instruments are available, including the Harvard Trauma Questionnaire to check for post-traumatic stress disorder, the Hopkins Symptom Checklist which screens for anxiety, and the Beck Depression Inventory.[15](#page-3-13)

#### **CONCLUSION**

Diseases seen in immigrants may be the result of exposures in their country of origin, during migration, or exposures occurring after arrival at their destination. Health professionals must take a detailed history about the type and duration of symptoms and think systematically while remembering where an immigrant has lived. It is always necessary to consider non-infectious processes as well, particularly mental health issues, which may not manifest until some time after arrival.
