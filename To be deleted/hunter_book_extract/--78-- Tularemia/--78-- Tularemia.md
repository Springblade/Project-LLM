# **78** Tularemia

*Max Maurin*

### KEY FEATURES

- • Tularemia is a rare zoonosis caused by the gram-negative bacterium *Francisella tularensis,* including subspecies *tularensis* (type A) and subsp. *holarctica* (type B).
- • The more virulent type A strains are mainly found in North America, whereas type B strains are found in the entire Northern Hemisphere and Australia.
- • A wide spectrum of animal species is susceptible to *F. tularensis* infection, but lagomorphs and small rodents are responsible for most human infections.
- • Humans become infected through direct contact with infected animals, through the bite of an arthropod, or after exposure to a *F. tularensis*–contaminated environment.
- • Tularemia is often a systemic disease with potential spread of bacteria to the entire reticuloendothelial system as a result of the intracellular lifestyle of *F. tularensis,* which can multiply within phagocytic cells, such as macrophages.
- • Six main syndromes are recognized based on the bacteria's portal of entry and resulting clinical manifestations: the ulceroglandular and glandular forms (skin), the oculoglandular form (conjunctival mucosa), the oropharyngeal form (digestive mucosa), the pneumonic form (respiratory mucosa or lung tissue via bacteremia), and the typhoidal form (severe systemic disease without detectable portal of entry or localized infection).
- • Although usually benign, tularemia may evolve to be a chronic, disabling, and even fatal disease. The high mortality rate of the pneumonic form of tularemia explains the potential use of *F. tularensis* for biological warfare and bioterrorism.
- • Patients with tularemia of mild to moderate severity should be treated with a fluoroquinolone as a first-line drug, or doxycycline as an alternative, whereas gentamicin should be given to patients with severe systemic disease.
- • There is no commercially available vaccine in the United States to prevent tularemia.

### **INTRODUCTION**

Tularemia is a zoonotic disease caused by *Francisella tularensis,* a bacterium first isolated in 1911 from ground squirrels in Tulare County, California.[1,2](#page-5-0) The genus *Francisella* was coined to honor Edward Francis, an American bacteriologist who greatly contributed to the description of the clinical and epidemiologic aspects of tularemia. *F. tularensis* is highly virulent in many animal species and humans. In the early 21st century, a renewed medical and scientific interest in this pathogen arose from its classification in the category A of select agents of the Centers for Diseases Control and Prevention.[3](#page-5-1) As a result, tularemia is currently considered an emerging or reemerging disease in many geographic areas.

### *F. TULARENSIS*

*F. tularensis* is a fastidious, gram-negative, facultative intracellular bacterium.[1](#page-5-0) This species is currently divided into sub-species, clades, and sub-clades of variable geographic distribution and virulence[.4,5](#page-5-2) Only two sub-species are responsible for tularemia: (1) subsp. *tularensis* (type A strains), mainly found in North America, comprising two major clades (AI and AII) and four subclades (AIa, AIb, AIIa, and AIIb); the AIb subclade contains the most virulent *F. tularensis* strains; and (2) subsp. *holarctica* (type B strains), found in the entire Northern Hemisphere but also Australia, comprising four major clades (B4 in North America, B6 in Western Europe, B12 in Eastern Europe and Central Asia, and B16 in Japan and other areas in Eastern Asia) and a higher number of subclades ([Fig. 78.1\)](#page-1-0).

### **EPIDEMIOLOGY**

Tularemia is classically a disease of the Northern Hemisphere,[1,6](#page-5-0) but type B strains have recently been detected in Australia.[7,8](#page-5-3) The highest incidences of human infections are currently observed in the United States, Russia, Scandinavia, Turkey, and Japan (see [Fig.](#page-1-0) [78.1](#page-1-0)). Unusual tularemia outbreaks have occurred in the last two decades in the United States, Turkey, Scandinavia, Bulgaria, Kosovo, Germany, and Spain, a previously non-endemic country[.9](#page-5-4) The spread of *F. tularensis,* whether intentional (bioterrorism) or not (e.g., importation of animals for hunting), in endemic or nonendemic areas is an ongoing public health threat.

In the United States, most human infections occur in Mid-Western states (Arkansas, Missouri, South Dakota, and Oklahoma) and in Massachusetts (particularly on Martha's Vineyard Island). Tularemia is absent from Hawaii. The AI strains are predominant in the central and eastern United States, and the AII strains are mainly found in California.[5,10](#page-5-5) Tularemia is endemic in all European countries except Iceland and the UK.[11](#page-5-6) A few type A strains were detected in the 1980s in fleas and mites collected in Slovakia and Austria, but no type A infection has been reported so far in humans in these countries.[12](#page-5-7) In Asia, tularemia is mainly found in Turkey, Japan, and the northern part of China.[13–15](#page-5-8)

A wide range of wildlife animal species may be carriers of or infected by *F. tularensis,* but lagomorphs (hares and wild rabbits) and small aquatic rodents (field mice, voles, muskrats, beavers, lemmings, etc.) are considered the main sources of human infections.[1](#page-5-0) Possums may carry type B strains in Australia.[8](#page-5-9) Domestic animals (especially dogs, cats, sheep, etc.) may be contaminated from the wildlife fauna. Arthropods, especially *Ixodidae* ticks and mosquitoes (mainly in Sweden and Finland), are involved in the transmission of *F. tularensis* within the animal reservoir ([Table 78.1](#page-1-1)). *F. tularensis* may also survive for prolonged periods in the hydro-telluric environment, potentially because of interactions with free-living protozoa.[16](#page-5-10)

Human contamination by *F. tularensis* can be achieved by different modes,[1](#page-5-0) including (1) animal bites or scratches; (2) manipulation of infected animals and carcasses (especially lagomorphs); (3) ingestion of undercooked meat prepared from infected animals (e.g., hare meat or terrine); (4) inhalational (including inhalation of atomized field rodents during mechanical landscaping/

mowing and/or contaminated dust); (5) drinking contaminated water (especially spring water and water from private water wells) in specific endemic areas (e.g., Turkey and Norway); (6) arthropod bites, mainly *Ixodidae* ticks, but also mosquitoes (e.g., *Aedes cinereus*) in Sweden and Finland, and occasionally tabanid flies; and (7) contact with a contaminated water or soil environment, including through a skin injury during gardening or contact with contaminated water during canyoning, crayfish fishing, etc. (see [Table](#page-1-1)

[78.1](#page-1-1)). Tularemia is more common in some occupationally exposed individuals (including farmers, veterinarians, landscapers, forest guards, military personnel, and laboratory workers handling *F. tularensis* cultures) and in persons engaged in certain leisure activities (including hunters, trappers, gardeners, and persons walking in tick-infested lands).

In some endemic areas, tularemia may be a seasonal disease. Arthropod-borne tularemia cases usually occur in spring, summer, and early autumn during the main activity of these vectors. In contrast, tularemia caused by direct contact with game animals usually occurs during the winter hunting season.

## NATURAL HISTORY, PATHOGENESIS, AND PATHOLOGY

Human inoculation with *F. tularensis* can occur through the skin, the conjunctiva, and the digestive or respiratory mucosa, leading to a cutaneous ulcer, conjunctivitis, pharyngitis (rarely enteritis), or pneumonia, respectively.<sup>17</sup> From this local infection site, bacteria rapidly invade the regional lymph nodes, resulting in a lymphadenopathy and a transient *F. tularensis* bacteremia. In most patients, the immune response will control the disease. In about 20% to 30% of cases, the lymphadenopathy will evolve to chronic suppuration and necrosis. Rarely, *F. tularensis* bacteremia may lead to severe sepsis and secondary localizations (e.g., meningitis, encephalitis, pneumonia, endocarditis, osteomyelitis).

*F. tularensis* virulence is mainly related to its ability to multiply within macrophages, due to specific virulence factors encoded by a pathogenicity island (FPI). <sup>18</sup> Additionally, *F. tularensis* does not trigger a high pro-inflammatory host response and possesses type IV pili, allowing tissue adhesion and invasion, and a surface exopolysaccharide capsule preventing the killing action of serum complement during bacteremia.

A humoral response develops within 2 weeks after infection with *F. tularensis*, with antibodies primarily directed against the bacterial LPS, but also against outer membrane proteins (OmpA, FopA) and intracellular proteins (GroEL, KatG). However, cell-mediated immunity (i.e., CD4+ and CD8+ T cells) is assumed to play a major role in controlling intracellular multiplication of *F. tularensis*.

Pathologic aspects of tularemia are not specific, but *F. tularensis* may be visualized in infected tissues by using specific antibodies. <sup>20</sup> In chronically enlarged lymph nodes, histologic lesions may range from well-defined zones of acute inflammation and necrosis located within the outer cortex of lymph nodes, to generalized necrosis that can obliterate the node. Granulomatous inflammation may be present. Caseous necrosis is usually absent. Post-mortem examination of infected tissues may reveal well-developed granulomas in lungs, liver, spleen, and lymph nodes, suggesting tuberculosis. Necrotizing pneumonia with abundant fibrin, cellular debris, edema, and neutrophils within alveolar walls and alveolar spaces may be observed.

### **CLINICAL FEATURES**

The incubation period of tularemia is typically 3 to 5 days, but may be up to 2 weeks. 1,2,21,22 The spectrum of the clinical manifestations may range from a few symptoms to a fulminant infection. However, most patients have symptoms of mild to moderate severity and seek medical attention several days or weeks after disease onset. The initial medical presentation of tularemia often corresponds to flulike symptoms, including fever, chills, headaches, myalgias, and arthralgias. A generalized papular or maculopapular rash that may become vesicular or pustular is frequently observed. Erythema nodosum is more common in women.

After a few days of evolution, six clinical forms are classically recognized and may occasionally be combined. 1,2,21,22 They are referred as the *ulceroglandular*; *glandular*; *oculoglandular*; *oropharyngeal*, *pneumonic*, and *typhoidal* forms. In a given geographic area, their prevalence varies according to the usual route of *F. tularensis* contamination.

The ulceroglandular and glandular forms occur after skin inoculation of *F. tularensis*. The former combines a cutaneous lesion at the site of *F. tularensis* inoculation and a regional palpable lymphadenopathy (Figs 78.2 and 78.3). The skin lesion first corresponds to a small papule that develops within

<span id="page-2-1"></span>a few days into a pustule and then a cutaneous eschar that is typically erythematous, indurated, and non-healing. In the rarer glandular form, a cutaneous lesion is missing. In both forms, the patient usually consults when the lymph nodes become severely enlarged and tender. The lymphadenopathy typically lasts for several weeks to months and evolves to suppuration in about 20% to 30% of cases (sometimes with skin fistulization), especially when adapted antibiotic therapy has been delayed for more than 2 weeks. Surgical treatment is often needed for cure, but lymph node incision should not be performed in the early stage of the disease because of the frequent spread of infection to surrounding tissues.

The oropharyngeal form of tularemia usually occurs a few days after oral contamination with *F. tularensis*, either though fingerto-mouth transmission of this pathogen (e.g., after manipulation of an infected animal) or via ingestion of undercooked food or water contaminated with *F. tularensis*. The disease often manifests as clustered cases, either in a family (food-borne infections) or in

a localized population (water-borne infections). Patients usually present with fever and acute exudative or membranous pharyngitis and rapid development of swollen cervical lymph nodes. Enlarged tonsils with yellow-white pseudo-membranes may suggest diphtheria. Pharyngitis is usually severe, of prolonged duration (several weeks to months), and resists β-lactam therapy. Complications may include cervical lymph node suppuration with skin fistulization and tonsillar phlegmon. Gastrointestinal tularemia probably develops in patients after ingestion of a high dose of bacteria and may manifest with mild diarrhea, abdominal pain, nausea, vomiting, and gastrointestinal bleeding. Enlarged mesenteric lymph nodes may be found. Extensive ulceration of the bowel may lead to severe symptoms and even death.

The oculoglandular form usually corresponds to conjunctival inoculation of *F. tularensis* by touch with a contaminated finger, for example, after manipulation of an infected animal or after crushing a tick. Symptoms usually manifest early and correspond to Parinaud's oculoglandular syndrome, combining a granulomatous unilateral conjunctivitis with homolateral regional lymphadenopathy ([Fig. 78.4](#page-3-0)). The inflamed conjunctiva is painful, with numerous yellowish nodules and pinpoint ulcers. Enlarged lymph nodes may be found in the pre-tragal, retroauricular, or cervical regions. β-Lactams are not effective, and the conjunctivitis may last for several weeks or months without appropriate antibiotic treatment. The most frequent complications include keratitis, sometimes with corneal perforation, lymph node suppuration, and cellulitis in nearby skin tissue.

The pneumonic form may develop after inhalation of an infectious aerosol or, alternatively, as a secondary localization of *F. tularensis* bacteremia. The clinical manifestations may vary from a fulminant pneumonia with lung tissue necrosis, usually in patients infected with a type A strain[23](#page-5-15), to a tuberculosis-like sub-acute or chronic pneumonia with hilar and mediastinal lymph nodes that may persist for several months after resolution of pneumonia, a presentation more frequently observed in patients infected with a type B strain, in Eurasia.[2](#page-5-16) However, in most patients, symptoms are those of atypical pneumonia, including fever, a non-productive cough, dyspnea, and pleuritic chest pain. Bilateral patchy infiltrates are found on chest radiography. Pleural effusions and empyema may develop.

The typhoidal form corresponds to a rapid systemic progression of tularemia with fever, a typhoid state, and shock in the absence of an apparent portal of entry (e.g., skin lesion) or lymphadenopathy. This form is often fatal when caused by type A strains.

Other rare clinical manifestations of tularemia, either inaugural or occurring as a complication of the classic clinical forms, may include meningitis, encephalitis, pericarditis, endocarditis, peritonitis, hepatitis, splenitis, osteoarticular infections, septic shock with rhabdomyolysis, and acute renal failure.

### **PATIENT EVALUATION, DIAGNOSIS, AND DIFFERENTIAL DIAGNOSIS**

Mild to moderate tularemia cases are usually managed on an outpatient basis. Patients with severe clinical manifestations (pneumonia, typhoidal tularemia, patients with secondary localizations, etc.) should be hospitalized and possibly admitted to an intensive care unit, especially if septic shock is present.

Non-specific biologic abnormalities may include moderate leukocytosis with granulocytosis, a relative increase in mononuclear cells, an inflammatory syndrome with mild elevation of C-reactive protein, and, rarely, a mild elevation of liver enzymes.

Tularemia diagnosis is usually confirmed by serologic methods, especially the microagglutination test, the indirect immunofluorescence assay, and enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) techniques[.2,6,22,24](#page-5-16) These tests are both sensitive and specific, but antibody titers are usually only detected at significant levels 2 to 3 weeks after symptom onset, peak after 6 to 8 weeks of progression of the disease, and then decline slowly over months or years. Cut-off titers may vary between laboratories using different techniques and antigens. A seroconversion or a fourfold rise in antibody titers between acute-phase and convalescent-phase sera is considered diagnostic. Cross-reacting antibodies have been reported between *Francisella* spp., *Brucella* spp., *Proteus* OX19, *Yersinia enterocolitica* O:3, and *Yersinia pestis* antigens, but titers are usually low and not confounding. Serologic tests cannot determine the *Francisella* sub-species and clade involved.

*F. tularensis* culture remains tedious and hazardous for laboratory personnel[.2,22,24](#page-5-16) Type A strains are class 3 pathogens and should be grown in a Biosafety Level (BSL) 3 laboratory, in biosafety cabinets with hoods to minimize aerosol-based exposure. Ideally, clinical samples should be directly inoculated to an antibiotic-containing medium to prevent overgrowth by commensal species, or kept at 4°C during transportation to the appropriate laboratory. Isolation of *F. tularensis* requires enriched medium containing cysteine (e.g., Thayer–Martin medium, chocolate agar supplemented with Polyvitex or Isovitalex) and incubation at 37°C for a minimum of 3 to 5 days. Automated blood culture systems are useful in the rare patients with bacteremia. *F. tularensis* may be grown from blood, skin eschar discharges, lymph node samples, conjunctival or throat swabs, cerebrospinal fluid (CSF), sputum, and other suppurations or organ biopsies. Culture sensitivity is considered low (about 25% for cutaneous and lymph node samples) and decreases significantly after administration of effective antibiotics. Suspected colonies may be rapidly identified as *F. tularensis* by using a specific antiserum, MALDI-TOF (matrix assisted laser desorption ionisation-time of flight) mass spectrometry (using an appropriate database), or by polymerase chain reaction (PCR) amplification of specific genes (e.g., *fopA* or *tul4*). Molecular methods also allow accurate determination of the involved *F. tularensis* sub-species, clade, and sub-clade, including analysis of whole-genome restriction digests by pulse-field gel electrophoresis, multiple-locus variable number tandem repeat analysis, and analysis of canonical SNPs (single nucleotide polymorphisms).

Direct PCR testing of clinical samples now provides a rapid, sensitive, and specific diagnosis of tularemia and carries a much lower infection risk for laboratory personnel than culture[.2,22,24](#page-5-16) Sensitivities of 73% to 78% and >90% have been reported for skin and lymph node samples, respectively, from patients with ulceroglandular tularemia. PCR often remains positive despite previous administration of antibiotics or when testing formalin-fixed tissue specimens. PCR targets are either genus or species specific, and include the insertion sequence *ISFtu2,* the 16SrRNA-encoding gene, the succinate dehydrogenase gene *SdhA,* and genes encoding outer membrane–associated proteins (Tul4, a 17-kDa lipoprotein encoded by the *tul4* gene; OmpA, a 43-kDa protein encoded by the *fopA* gene; and an unnamed 23-kDa protein).

Tularemia should be systematically evoked in patients living in (or visiting) an endemic area, with compatible clinical manifestations and a potential exposure. When suggestive epidemiologic conditions are lacking, however, the differential diagnosis of tularemia may be wide because symptoms are poorly specific. Ulceroglandular tularemia is the most easily diagnosed form, but atypical skin lesions associated with enlarged lymph nodes may suggest infections caused by *Staphylococcus aureus, Streptococcus pyogenes,* or *Mycobacterium marinum,* as well as cat scratch disease, pasteurellosis, syphilis, anthrax, rat bite fever, rickettsiosis, and sporotrichosis. The chronically evolving lymphadenopathy of the glandular form is more challenging and may suggest other infectious diseases (tuberculosis, non-tuberculous mycobacterial diseases, cat scratch disease, plague, lymphogranuloma venereum, Epstein–Barr virus [EBV], cytomegalovirus [CMV] or HIV infections, toxoplasmosis, or histoplasmosis) and non-infectious diseases (immunologic diseases, malignant diseases including lymphoma, etc.). Oropharyngeal tularemia may suggest *S. pyogenes* (group A) infection or diphtheria in the case of pseudomembranous pharyngitis. Failure of β-lactam therapy may prompt the clinician to make further investigations, but diagnosis is often delayed. Parinaud's oculoglandular syndrome is not specific, and *Mycobacterium tuberculosis, Bartonella henselae,* and herpesvirus are more frequent etiologies of this syndrome, among others. *F. tularensis* pneumonia should be considered together with other causes of atypical pneumonia, including plague and anthrax in the context of bioterrorism. The symptoms of typhoidal tularemia may be observed in many other severe infectious diseases.

### **TREATMENT**

Human tularemia cases are usually more severe in North America than in Eurasia. The global mortality rates for type A and type B infections are 0.5% to 1% and <0.1%, respectively, when appropriate antibiotic therapy is administrated.[22,24](#page-5-19) Higher mortality rates (30% or more) have been reported in patients with the pneumonic or typhoidal forms and in immunocompromised patients. Importantly, by studying 316 human isolates collected from tularemia cases occurring in the United States in the 1964 to 2004 period, Kugeler et al.[25](#page-5-20) reported variable mortality rates according to the *F. tularensis* genotype involved: 24% for AIb strains, 7% for B strains, 4% for AIa strains, and 0% for AII strains, respectively.

In vitro, most strains of *F. tularensis* are resistant to penicillin G and aminopenicillins because of the action of a β-lactamase[.26](#page-5-21) Susceptibility to third-generation cephalosporins (e.g., cefotaxime, ceftriaxone) varies according to the strains studied, but these antibiotics are not effective against intracellular *F. tularensis.* Thus beta-lactams are considered clinically unreliable. Chloramphenicol, cotrimoxazole, and most macrolides (especially erythromycin) are poorly effective. The B12 strains of *F. tularensis* display much higher resistance levels to erythromycin than other genotypes. Azithromycin (an azalide) and telithromycin (a ketolide) are more effective than erythromycin, but remain inactive against the B12 strains. Rifampin is active in vitro, but is not used as monotherapy because of possible selection for resistance. The aminoglycosides, the fluoroquinolones, and the tetracyclines are highly active against *F. tularensis,* both in axenic medium and in cell systems.

The optimum treatment of tularemia cannot be based on randomized, controlled clinical trials because the disease is so rare. According to clinical experience, the aminoglycosides are considered the most effective antibiotics in patients with severe systemic diseases [\(Table 78.2](#page-4-1))[.6,22,24,27](#page-5-22) Because streptomycin is now difficult to obtain in many countries, gentamicin is currently used as an alternative, with the monitoring of antibiotic serum levels. However, aminoglycosides have many side effects (including ototoxicity and nephrotoxicity) and are only administrable parenterally.

The fluoroquinolones are now proposed as first-line drugs in the vast majority of patients with mild to moderate clinical manifestations,[6,22,24,27](#page-5-22) including in children, as the risk of skeletal toxicity appears low. Their clinical efficacy is better documented in type B than in type A tularemia. These antibiotics are less toxic than aminoglycosides and administrable orally. Ciprofloxacin (500– 750 mg orally twice daily) has been used in most cases reported in the literature, but levofloxacin (500 mg orally once daily) may also be effective.

Tetracyclines, mainly doxycycline (100 mg orally twice daily), represent a possible alternative, although more frequent relapses are observed upon antibiotic withdrawal.[6,22,24,27](#page-5-22) Gastrointestinal side effects are frequent, but may be reduced by taking the drug with food. Tetracyclines are classically contraindicated in children less than 8 years old because of the risk of tooth discoloration, and in pregnant women because of fetal bone toxicity.

Whatever the drug administered, 10 to 14 days treatment duration should be considered a minimum. Failures and relapses may still be observed in patients with severe disease and/or with delayed onset of appropriate antibiotic therapy. Suppurated lymph nodes may need to be surgically removed to obtain clinical cure. Combined therapy (e.g., an aminoglycoside with a tetracycline or a fluoroquinolone) has been occasionally used in patients with severe disease. There is no indication that it may be superior to monotherapy.

Antibiotic treatment of tularemia in pregnant women remains an unsolved problem. Azithromycin has been used successfully in a few patients in Western Europe[,28](#page-5-23) where only the B6 strains cause tularemia. Telithromycin may be an interesting alternative, but clinical data are lacking, and its administration in pregnant women is currently not recommended. Gentamicin may be used in severe cases, but exposes the mother and fetus to ototoxicity and nephrotoxicity.

Prevention of tularemia in the most at-risk persons includes (1) avoiding exposure to sick animals and wearing protective gloves

when handling animal carcasses; (2) wearing long clothing and using insect repellents when walking in endemic areas to prevent arthropod bites, as well as careful skin inspection and prompt removal of ticks; and (3) performing *F. tularensis* cultures in a BSL 3 laboratory to prevent laboratory contamination. Post-exposure prophylaxis of tularemia may be considered in the context of bioterrorism, during food- or water-borne tularemia outbreaks, or in laboratory workers after contamination with *F. tularensis* cultures. Ciprofloxacin or doxycycline administered for 10 to 14 days at a full dosage is currently recommended, but clinical data supporting these recommendations are scarce.

No tularemia vaccine is currently licensed for human use. Inactivated vaccines and purified immunogenic polysaccharide- or protein-based vaccines have not proved to be effective in preventing tularemia[.29](#page-5-24) Live attenuated vaccines were first developed in the former Soviet Union, and the live vaccine strain (LVS) was developed in the United States from a Russian strain. The main objective of these vaccines was to protect the human population from the use of *F. tularensis* as a biological weapon and to protect the laboratory personnel involved in the culture of this pathogen. However, they were less effective in preventing ulceroglandular tularemia and had significant side effects. Moreover, the basis of attenuation of these strains was not fully characterized. The LVS has not been licensed by the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) in the United States, or in any other country. Construction of defined attenuated strains of *F. tularensis* is under way.
