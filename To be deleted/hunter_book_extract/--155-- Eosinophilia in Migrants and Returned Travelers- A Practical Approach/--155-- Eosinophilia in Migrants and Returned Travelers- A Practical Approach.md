# **155** Eosinophilia in Migrants and Returned Travelers: A Practical Approach

*Anna M. Checkley, Christopher J. M. Whitty*

## KEY FEATURES

- • Peripheral eosinophilia is usually defined as ≥450 eosinophils/microliter of blood (0.45 × 109 /L).
- • All individuals returning from tropical areas with peripheral eosinophilia should be investigated with stool microscopy for ova and parasites and strongyloides serology.
- • Evaluation for schistosomiasis and filariasis should also be considered depending on exposure.
- • Any helminthic infection with a tissue-invasive phase can be associated with peripheral eosinophilia, and clinical clues can assist with identifying cases of toxocariasis, trichinosis, gnathostomiasis, sparganosis, fascioliasis, and angiostrongyliasis, among others.
- • Protozoal parasitic causes include cystoisosporiasis, dientamoebiasis, and sarcocystosis. Non-parasitic causes of peripheral eosinophilia include HIV, HTLV-I, syphilis, tuberculosis, resolving scarlet fever, allergic bronchopulmonary aspergillosis, and coccidioidomycosis.

#### **INTRODUCTION**

Eosinophilia, defined here as an absolute eosinophil count greater than 0.45 × 109 /L, historically occurred in about 10% of migrants and travelers returning from the tropics and seeking post-travel care.[1](#page-6-0) Major control measures have changed the epidemiology of helminths in some countries. In travelers and recent migrants from tropical countries, the presence of eosinophilia now signifies an underlying helminth infection in around half of cases[,2](#page-6-1) most frequently with a nematode (for example, hookworm) or trematode (fluke, e.g., schistosomiasis)[.3](#page-6-2)

The cause of eosinophilia varies depending on the patient group and regions visited. Eosinophilia is often higher in travelers, most of whom have been recently infected with helminths, than in chronically infected migrants; migrants with helminth infections often do not have eosinophilia, and it should therefore not be used as a screening tool on its own[.4](#page-6-3) Certain helminth infections, such as Katayama syndrome (acute schistosomiasis), tropical pulmonary eosinophilia, and strongyloides infection, are associated with a higher eosinophilia (>2 × 109 /L), as are multiple helminth infections. The prevalence of imported helminth infections is highly dependent on the geographic area visited, and this is reflected in published case series in migrants and travelers. Studies from North America, where many migrants are from Asia and Latin America, report a higher proportion of strongyloides infection[.5](#page-6-4) Those from Europe, where a higher proportion of travelers and migrants are from Africa, report more schistosomiasis, although the relative importance of schistosomiasis has probably decreased over time even in those from Africa[.2](#page-6-1)

It is important to investigate eosinophilia in returning travelers and migrants; although helminth infections are often self-limiting and cause little harm, they occasionally cause long-term health problems. For example, strongyloides infection can result in a dangerous hyper-infection syndrome[,5](#page-6-4) and schistosomiasis is occasionally associated with hepatic fibrosis and bladder carcinoma.

Eosinophilia has numerous non-infectious causes, most commonly drugs, atopy (asthma and eczema), and allergy. These and uncommon but serious non-infectious causes such as hematopoietic malignancies and connective tissue disorders are summarized in [Table 155.1.](#page-1-0) Long-standing moderate-/high-grade eosinophilia (>1.5 × 109 /L) can itself result in end-organ damage.

### **GENERAL PRINCIPLES**

#### **History and Physical Examination**

A medical history can establish to which parasites the individual may have been exposed. This is mainly determined by the geographic regions the traveler or migrant has visited. This should be noted in detail, including travel within the country (urban or rural), activities undertaken, and the timings of these events. A history of relevant exposures should also be sought, including swimming in freshwater, particularly in Africa (schistosomiasis), barefoot exposure to soil or sand (strongyloidiasis, hookworm), food consumed (parasites of uncooked seafood or meat), and occupation (hydatid disease in sheep farmers). It should be kept in mind, however, that risk factors for exposure to infectious agents are frequently underreported. Eosinophilia can be asymptomatic, but symptoms such as fever, cough, diarrhea, dysuria, and rash should be specifically queried. A few symptoms are sufficiently suggestive and a diagnosis can be made on history alone—eye worm in *Loa loa* is the most striking example[6](#page-6-5) —but in general laboratory confirmation will be needed. The possibility of a noninfectious cause should be explored by taking a careful drug history and asking about pre-existing medical conditions such as allergic rhinitis or asthma.

Physical examination is not helpful in reaching a diagnosis in many cases[,7](#page-6-6) but attention should be paid to the presence of rashes suggestive of skin conditions that can result in eosinophilia; other disease-specific findings are mentioned later.

#### **Laboratory Investigations**

Laboratory investigations, guided by the geographic area of travel, are the key to the effective diagnosis of eosinophilia. The timing at which tests are taken in the course of helminth infection is particularly important in interpreting the results. Eosinophilia is often greatest during the tissue migration phase of the parasite, for example, in Katayama syndrome, before eggs can be detected in the stool. The period before eggs can be detected is termed the *pre-patent period,* and it is important to be aware that during this phase, samples for microscopy for ova or parasites may be negative. Eosinophilia can be transient or absent from helminth infections without a tissue migration stage of infection, for example, the beef tapeworm *Taenia saginata.* The absence of eosinophilia does not exclude helminth infection.

#### Direct Microscopy

Concentrated stool microscopy identifies most soil-transmitted helminths (e.g., *Ascaris lumbricoides, Trichuris trichiura,* hookworm

spp.) and is useful in patients from all geographic areas. However, it has a low sensitivity in detecting strongyloides. Microscopy of urine for *Schistosoma haematobium* and of filtered blood for filarial infections is useful in patients from relevant geographic areas.

#### Serology

Most serologic tests do not become positive until 4 to 12 weeks after infection, so can be negative when eosinophilia is first detected. It may be worth repeating serologic investigations at 3 months if they were initially negative and eosinophilia persists. Many serologic tests for helminths cross-react, so taking expert advice is recommended. [Table 155.2](#page-2-0) outlines common helminths, their microscopic appearance, diagnostic tests, and treatments.

#### **Management**

The management of certain important conditions is outlined later, and is covered in greater detail in disease-specific chapters and in [Table 155.2.](#page-2-0) Empiric albendazole (400 mg twice daily for 3 days) is recommended by some experts for those recently returned from the tropics to cover the possibility of pre-patent geohelminth infection (e.g., *Ascaris* and hookworm) as the cause of a transient eosinophilia with negative stool microscopy.

#### **Follow-Up Issues**

Eosinophilia should resolve after treatment of the underlying cause, and it is important to establish that this has happened. Occasionally, a finding such as positive schistosoma serology in a long-term resident of an endemic area can be mistaken to be the cause of eosinophilia, when in fact there is another cause. Serology often remains positive for many years, and is not a good measure of effective treatment.

#### **CLINICAL SYNDROMES**

#### **Asymptomatic Eosinophilia**

We suggest investigating this common presentation[3](#page-6-2) of potential helminth infection from the basis of the travel history, and therefore the geographic distribution of helminth infections. The soiltransmitted helminths *A. lumbricoides, T. trichiura, S. stercoralis,* and hookworm have a worldwide distribution. Others, especially those with a life cycle involving an intermediate host or vector, or those associated with certain foods, have defined geographic limits. The most common pathogens causing eosinophilia in all returned travelers and migrants are intestinal helminths, especially strongyloidiasis, and in those returning from Africa, schistosomiasis; filarial disease is now much less common than it used to be in imported series.

All patients presenting with eosinophilia should be investigated with concentrated stool microscopy, strongyloides serology and an HIV test.[2](#page-6-1) Other initial parasitic screening investigations are region specific. Terminal urine microscopy (for ova) and serology for schistosomiasis should be performed in those returning from Africa. The filarial infections *L. loa, Onchocerca volvulus,* and *Wuchereria bancrofti* are more common in patients from West Africa, so filarial serology should be requested routinely from this area, and filtered blood microscopy for microfilaria should be considered if there is a strong reason for clinical suspicion or filarial serology is positive (see "[Dermatologic Presentations](#page-6-7)").

If initially negative, stool microscopy should be performed on a total of up to three occasions, and serology should be repeated at 3 months if it was first taken less than 12 weeks after the time of probable exposure. If initial investigations are negative, attention should be paid to the possibility of other parasitic, non parasitic and non-infectious causes. An empiric course of albendazole can be considered.

[Table 155.3](#page-4-0) lists common helminth infections by geographic area and summarizes clinical presentations.

#### **Fever and/or Respiratory Symptoms**

#### Katayama Syndrome

This occurs during acute schistosomiasis infection 2 to 9 weeks after exposure. It presents with fever and high-grade eosinophilia (>5 × 109 /L), dry cough, urticarial rash, and sometimes pulmonary infiltrates on chest radiograph. Serology and stool and terminal urine microscopy are often negative. Empiric treatment should be given when this presentation is accompanied by a history of freshwater exposure in Africa: praziquantel 20 mg/kg in two doses 6 hours apart and oral prednisolone 20 mg/day for 5 days. Praziquantel is relatively ineffective against immature stages of schistosomiasis, so treatment should be repeated at 6 to 8 weeks.

#### Loeffler's Syndrome

The relatively rare Loeffler's syndrome is caused by larvae of helminths such as *Ascaris,* hookworm, and *Strongyloides* migrating through the lungs during acute infection. It presents similarly to Katayama syndrome, with fever, urticaria, wheeze, and dry cough. Diagnosis is clinical, as symptoms occur before eggs can be detected in the stool. Migratory pulmonary infiltrates may be seen on chest radiograph. Albendazole 400 mg/day for 3 days is recommended.

#### **Gastrointestinal/Genitourinary Symptoms**

#### Strongyloidiasis

This is widely distributed throughout the tropics. It is transmitted when larvae penetrate the skin of humans walking barefoot. It often presents with larva currens, an itchy, linear, urticarial rash that typically moves several millimeters per second [\(Fig. 155.1](#page-3-0)). Non-specific gastrointestinal symptoms include diarrhea and abdominal bloating. In immunocompromised individuals, strongyloides can present decades after exposure as *hyper-infestation syndrome*[6](#page-6-5) with paralytic ileus and gram-negative sepsis. This condition is due to uncontrolled replication of the parasite and is life threatening.

Diagnosis of strongyloides infection can be difficult: serology is usually the most sensitive test, and stool microscopy is often negative. The reverse applies in the hyper-infestation syndrome, where stool samples contain abundant larvae but serology may be negative and eosinophilia absent. Stool culture (performed in specialist laboratories) is recommended in cases where diagnosis is difficult or the danger of missing strongyloides is high. Treatment is with a single dose of ivermectin 200 µg/kg, or (less effective) albendazole 400 mg twice daily for 3 days[.8](#page-6-8) Hyper-infection of strongyloides in the immunosuppressed should be treated with a prolonged course. Migrants from all tropical regions should be screened for strongyloides before starting treatment with immunosuppressive drugs.

#### Soil-Transmitted Helminths (Geohelminths)

These have a worldwide distribution but are most prevalent in the tropics. *Ascaris* and *Trichuris* are transmitted via the fecal–oral route, and hookworm is acquired when larvae penetrate the skin of humans walking barefoot on affected soil. They are often asymptomatic. Hookworm may present with a transient itch and maculopapular rash, followed weeks later by nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, and abdominal pain. *Ascaris* may present as Loeffler's syndrome or, weeks later, with abdominal pain, diarrhea, and

occasionally gastrointestinal or biliary obstruction. Visible worms may be passed in stools. *Trichuris* infection is usually asymptomatic, but heavy infections can cause morbidity in children, including anemia, dysentery, and rectal prolapse. All are diagnosed by concentrated stool microscopy. *Ascaris* and hookworm are treated with a single dose of albendazole 400 mg; trichuriasis requires albendazole 400 to 800 mg twice daily for 3 days.

### Schistosomiasis/Bilharzia: *Schistosoma mansoni, S. japonicum,* and *S. haematobium*

Schistosomiasis is widely distributed, particularly in Africa (*S. haematobium* and *S. mansoni*), Latin America (especially areas of Brazil, *S. mansoni*), and is less commonly from Southeast Asia (*S. japonicum* and other spp.).[9](#page-6-9) Schistosomiasis is acquired after freshwater exposure, usually swimming. Infection is often asymptomatic. *S. haematobium* affects the genitourinary system and can present with hematuria, proteinuria, dysuria, and hematospermia. *S. mansoni* and *S. japonicum* affect the gastrointestinal tract and can present with abdominal pain or diarrhea. Schistosomiasis is diagnosed by serology and microscopy of either nitrocellulose-filtered terminal urine (*S. haematobium*) or concentrated stool samples (*S. mansoni* and *S. japonicum).* Treatment is with praziquantel 20 mg/kg in two doses 6 hours apart. *S. haematobium* infection has been linked to squamous cell carcinoma of the bladder, and heavy infections require cystoscopic investigation, especially if hematuria persists after treatment.

#### Hydatid

Hydatid disease is most often seen in individuals returning from sheep-rearing areas, especially the Middle East, although it also occurs in North and East Africa, Asia, Europe, and the Americas. Affected individuals are usually asymptomatic; eosinophilia, right upper quadrant pain, and fever can indicate cyst leakage or infection. The presence of peripheral eosinophilia usually suggests a leakage of cyst contents, often into the biliary system. Diagnosis is by serology with characteristic appearances on ultrasound or computed tomography (CT). Treatment depends on factors such as cyst size, location, and stage[.10](#page-6-10) Options include "PAIR" (puncture, aspiration of cyst contents, injection of a substance toxic to the immature "scolices," and re-aspiration), prolonged albendazole, surgery, or a combination of methods. Surgical and percutaneous intervention carry a risk of anaphylaxis and cyst dissemination, and should be performed in specialist centers.

#### Liver Flukes

Liver flukes, including *Fasciola hepatica, Clonorchis sinensis,* and *Opisthorchis* spp., typically present with hepatomegaly and symptoms of bile duct obstruction such as right upper quadrant pain and jaundice. They are diagnosed by stool microscopy (low sensitivity in fasciola infection) and serology, and treated with triclabendazole (*Fasciola*) and praziquantel (*Opisthorchis* and *Clonorchis*).

#### **Neurologic Symptoms**

Rarely, parasites invade the central nervous system (CNS) and cause an eosinophilic meningitis, encephalitis, or myelitis. The most common cause of eosinophilic meningitis is *Angiostrongylus cantonensis,* the rat lung worm. This occurs in the Caribbean, Hawaii, and Southeast Asia, and is acquired after the ingestion of larvae in undercooked snails, prawns, crabs, or frogs. It presents with severe acute headache, meningism, visual disturbance, paresthesias, and cranial nerve palsies. Gnathostomiasis is a less common cause, occurring in Southeast Asia. It is acquired by consuming inadequately cooked fish, frog, snake, or chicken and presents with a severe meningoencephalitis and myelitis*,* which can be fatal. Diagnosis

of both infections is by serology; treatment is with albendazole and corticosteroids.

Schistosomiasis can rarely present with CNS involvement. Seizures or focal neurologic signs can occur, most commonly in *S. japonicum* infection. Involvement of the spinal cord, usually with paraplegia, is more widely reported with *S. mansoni* and *S. haematobium.* Treatment consists of an extended course of praziquantel and high-dose steroids.

Filariasis: Onchocerciasis, Lymphatic Filariasis, and *Loa loa*

The major filariases are onchocerciasis, lymphatic filariasis (*W. bancrofti* and *Brugia malayi*) and *L. loa.*

Onchocerciasis, or river blindness, occurs around fast-flowing rivers mainly in Africa. It presents with an itchy rash, which over a long period can develop into a "leopard skin" pattern of hypopigmented patches and nodules. Migration of microfilariae within the eye results in keratitis, anterior uveitis, and choroidoretinitis, with eventual blindness. Lymphatic filariasis has a worldwide tropical distribution, although it is most common in Africa. Presentation is with fever, lymphangitis, and lymphedema that can include the scrotum. Loiasis occurs mainly in Central and West Africa. It causes migratory soft tissue "Calabar" swellings. Sometimes the adult worm is seen migrating across the conjunctiva.[7](#page-6-6)

Serology is most sensitive for diagnosing lymphatic filariasis, but can be positive in any of the filariases. Microfilariae of *W. bancrofti, B. malayi,* and *L. loa* circulate in the bloodstream with a diurnal periodicity and can be diagnosed by blood taken around midnight (lymphatic filariasis) or midday (*L. loa*). In routine practice, day bloods (taken around midday) for microscopy of filtered blood are often adequate. They are the investigation of choice for *L. loa* and should detect *W. bancrofti.* In difficult cases, bloods taken around midnight have higher sensitivity for *W. bancrofti. L. loa* can also be diagnosed clinically when conjunctival migration is seen. Onchocerciasis can be diagnosed by microscopy of skin snips (shallow snips of skin are taken, then incubated in saline before microscopy), or if microfilariae are seen on slit lamp examination of an affected eye.

Treatment is associated with significant risks and should be carried out in specialist centers. Lymphatic filariasis and *L. loa* are treated with diethylcarbamazine (DEC), after onchocerciasis has been excluded, as DEC can cause severe reactions, including blindness in individuals infected with onchocerciasis. Encephalopathy can occur after treatment of *L. loa,* and prednisolone pre-treatment is necessary if there are high levels of microfilariae in the blood. Onchocerciasis is treated with ivermectin 200 µg/ kg monthly for 3 months, repeated every 3 to 6 months, usually for several years.
