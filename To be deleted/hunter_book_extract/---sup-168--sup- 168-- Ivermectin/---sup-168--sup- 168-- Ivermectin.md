# **<sup>168</sup> 168** Ivermectin

*Philip J. Cooper, Thomas B. Nutman*

## **DESCRIPTION**

22,23-dihydroderivative of avermectin B1.

### **AVAILABLE PRODUCT**

Stromectol/Mectizan tablets (Merck Sharpe & Dohme,Whitehouse Station, NJ): 3 mg and 6 mg.

## **INDICATIONS**

- 1. Treatment of onchocerciasis (*Onchocerca volvulus*).
- 2. Treatment of lymphatic filariasis (*Wuchereria bancrofti, Brugia malayi*) in combination with albendazole or diethylcarbamazine.
- 3. Treatment of strongyloidiasis (*Strongyloides stercoralis*).
- 4. Treatment of scabies (*Sarcoptes scabies*).
- 5. Treatment of intestinal helminth infections:
  - a. *Ascaris lumbricoides*—highly effective
  - b. *Trichuris trichiura*—more effective in combination with albendazole
  - c. Hookworm—possible benefits by adding ivermectin to albendazole
- 6. Ivermectin is effective for the treatment of other ectoparasitic infections, including human body lice and head lice.
- 7. Ivermectin appears to be effective for the treatment of cutaneous larva migrans caused by animal hookworms.

## **MODE OF ACTION**

Ivermectin blocks transmission across nerve synapses that use glutamate-gated anion channels or γ−aminobutyric acid (GABA)– gated chloride channels through stimulation of GABA by presynaptic nerve endings and enhancement of binding to postsynaptic nerve endings. This effect prevents nerve impulse conduction, causing parasite paralysis and death.

### **PHARMACOKINETICS**

Peak serum levels are reached 4 to 5 hours after oral ingestion[1](#page-1-0) ; highly lipid soluble with highest concentrations observed in liver and fat[2](#page-1-1) and extremely low levels in brain; plasma half-life is approximately 18 hours: liver metabolism and almost all ivermectin and/or its metabolites are excreted in feces and just 1% in the urine.

#### **DOSE ADJUSTMENTS IN RENAL FAILURE**

None.

#### **DOSE ADJUSTMENTS IN LIVER FAILURE**

None.

#### **DOSE**

• Treatment of onchocerciasis: Children/adults >15 kg weight: 150 mcg/kg for one dose annually or semi-annually for ≈5 years.

- • Treatment of lymphatic filariasis[3](#page-1-2) :
  - Children/adults >15 kg weight: single dose of 150 µg/kg annually in combination with another filaricidal drug.
- • Treatment of strongyloidiasis and other intestinal helminth infections[3,4](#page-1-2):
  - Children/adults >15 kg weight: single dose of 200 µg/kg.
- • Treatment of scabies[5](#page-1-3) :
  - Children/adults >15 kg weight: single dose of 200 µg/kg. Repeat dose after 1 to 2 weeks.
- • Treatment of human body lice and head lice[5](#page-1-3) : Children/adults >15 kg weight: single dose of 200 µg/kg. Repeat dose after 1 to 2 weeks.
- • Treatment of cutaneous larva migrans[5](#page-1-3) : Children/adults >15 kg weight: single dose of 200 µg/kg.

## **ROUTE OF ADMINISTRATION**

Oral.

## **HOW TO GIVE THE DRUG**

On an empty stomach.

### **ADVERSE EVENTS AND SERIOUS ADVERSE EVENTS**

- • Dermatologic: A Mazzotti-type reaction may follow 2 to 4 days after the administration of ivermectin in individuals with *O. volvulus* infection.[6](#page-1-4) Such reactions are associated with localized pruritus and edema accompanied by papular or urticarial rashes. Occasionally, the patient may have systemic features, such as fever, postural hypotension, arthralgia, myalgia, and headache. Pruritus and maculopapular rashes have been reported 2 to 4 days after treatment of scabies.[5](#page-1-3)
- • Gastrointestinal: Nausea and vomiting.
- • Hematologic: Single oral doses of ivermectin have been associated with prolongation of prothrombin times and occasional hematomas,[7](#page-1-5) but concern about hematologic effects in mass drug distribution does not appear to be justified.[1](#page-1-0)
- • Hepatic: A temporary mild to moderate elevation of alanine amino transferase has been reported in some patients.[8](#page-1-6)
- • Ocular: Mild ocular irritation associated with death of *O. volvulus* microfilariae in the cornea and anterior chamber of the eye.

#### **KEY DRUG INTERACTIONS**

Rare post-marketing reports of increased international normalized ratio when co-administered with warfarin; may enhance some of the pharmacologic actions of diazepam.

#### **CONTRAINDICATIONS**

Possible concurrent infection with *Loa loa.* The death of *L. loa* microfilariae may cause a severe, or even fatal, encephalopathy. Individuals with heavy microfilaremia are particularly at risk. Individuals who may have an exposure history to *L. loa* should have heavy infections excluded by examination of thin blood films obtained at midday.

### **USE IN SPECIAL POPULATIONS**

#### **Pregnancy**

Category C.

#### **Lactation**

Small quantities of ivermectin (2%) enter breast milk.[2](#page-1-1) Treatment is not recommended in lactating women with infants less than 1 week of age.

### **Pediatrics**

Recommended for use only in children >15 kg weight.

## **Elderly (Age >60)**

No adjustment.

## **RESISTANCE**

Resistance to ivermectin is widespread among veterinary parasites but still no proven resistance among parasites of human populations. Some evidence of reduced responsiveness of *O. volvulus* to ivermectin among a few individuals[.9](#page-1-7)

## **STORAGE**

Room temperature; protect from light.

### **AVAILABILITY IN THE UNITED STATES**

Oral tablets (Stromectol) available.
