#### *Michel Drancourt*

## KEY FEATURES

- • Plague is a deadly zoonosis caused by the bacterium *Yersinia pestis.*
- • *Y. pestis* can persist in soil.
- • Historically, the rat flea has been a prime vector for causing human plague, with human ectoparasites (lice and fleas) promoting explosive epidemics. Plague can also be acquired through consumption of uncooked contaminated meat.
- • Human plague most commonly manifests as febrile lymphadenitis (bubonic plague). Primary pneumonic, septicemic, and ingestional plague also occur.
- • Untreated bubonic plague evolves toward septicemic and pneumonic plague, with death occurring in fewer than 7 days.
- • Plague has had a huge impact on humanity and resulted in the death of one third of the population of Western Europe in the Middle Ages.
- • The current global plague pandemic is now over a century old and involves cases in Asia, Africa, and America.
- • Diagnosis usually rests on clinical suspicion and microbiologic confirmation; point-of-care diagnostic assays are available.
- • Treatment usually involves gentamicin, streptomycin, and/or doxycycline.
- • Prevention usually involves limiting human–rodent– zoonotic–ectoparasitic interactions. Chemoprophylaxis may be indicated in certain situations.

#### **INTRODUCTION**

Plague is a deadly zoonosis caused by *Yersinia pestis*, a bacterium first isolated in 1894 by Alexandre Yersin in Hong Kong at the outset of the most recent pandemic, which is still ongoing.[2](#page-5-1) Plague is a reportable and quarantinable disease covered by national and international health regulations. Plague has had a huge impact on humanity. It was probably the cause of the Justinian plague of the 6th century and was definitely the cause of the Black Death plague in Europe in the Middle Ages that claimed one third of the affected population.[3](#page-6-0) The current pandemic began in Asia in the end of the 19th century and now involves the Old and New World. *Y. pestis* genotyping indicates that ancient *Y. pestis* organisms belonged to an Orientalis-like biotype[.3](#page-6-0)

#### **EPIDEMIOLOGY**

#### **Plague Cycles**

Any of the five recognized *Y. pestis* biotypes can circulate in rodents, causing epizoonoses of limited geographic extension. Such epizootics can lead to sporadic human cases. Focal and limited human outbreaks can also occur as a result of the exposure of humans to infected animals, or because of limited direct or vector-borne inter-human transmission. In comparison, extensive and ongoing human outbreaks have been associated with the Orientalis biotype, including the current worldwide pandemic.

#### **Animal Infection**

*Y. pestis* can persist in soil for several months, particularly in moderate salt soil[,4](#page-6-1) contributing to the long-term persistence of regional plague foci and acting as a source of infection for burrowing rodents.[5](#page-6-2) More than 200 species of rodents can be infected by *Y. pestis,* with plague disease–resistant species being regarded as reservoirs for *Y. pestis*. [1,6](#page-5-0) Several ectoparasites, including ticks, have been found to be naturally infected with *Y. pestis,* but fleas are thought to be the vector of primary importance. One hundred and thirty-one species of fleas are the most common vectors of *Y. pestis* among rodents[.1,6](#page-5-0) Fleas are particularly effective at transmitting *Y. pestis,* as ingested *Y. pestis* bacteria express plasminogen activator Pla that leads to blockage of the flea proventriculus, facilitating both increased hunger and therefore attempted feeding of the flea and contamination of regurgitated blood back into the bite site[.1](#page-5-0) *Y. pestis* has evolved numerous mechanisms to suppress inflammatory responses in plague-resistant hosts, promoting high blood concentrations (up to 108 organisms/mL) and facilitating successful transmission via the small amount of blood ingested by a flea (10<sup>−</sup><sup>4</sup> mL).

Carnivores can be infected after ingestion of contaminated rodents, but dogs and canids are resistant to plague[7](#page-6-3) [\(Fig. 77.1](#page-1-0)). The complex life cycle of *Y. pestis* involving soil, ectoparasites, and mammals results in a variable prevalence of animal plague (enzoonosis) with sudden outbreaks of dying off in plague-susceptible animals (epizoonoses).

#### **Human Plague** ([Fig. 77.2\)](#page-2-0)

Inoculation by an infectious flea or louse bite can result in bubonic plague. Infectious fleas often leave dead rodents and will drink human blood if rodents are not available. Fleas must have a daily blood meal in order to survive—the risk of being bitten by infected fleas is especially high after large numbers of plague-infected rats have died.[1](#page-5-0) Inoculation through skin lacerations may result in bubonic or septicemic plague after handling (typically skinning) dead animals.[7](#page-6-3)

Inhalation of *Y. pestis* leads to primary pneumonic plague and involves inhalation of large droplets after close contact (<1.5 meters) with infected cats or a patient coughing copious amounts of bloody sputum. The average number of secondary cases per primary inhalational case is 1.3.[8,9](#page-6-4)

Ingestion of *Y. pestis* has been observed after consumption of raw or poorly cooked contaminated food, with contaminated camel meat and liver being the most frequently reported source of food-borne transmission[.7](#page-6-3)

Human ectoparasitic transmission may be an under-appreciated route of human-to-human transmission that may have played a key role during historical epidemics.[10](#page-6-5) Transmission by the anthropophilic flea *Pulex irritans* and by the human body louse *Pediculus humanus* has been suggested during familial cases of plague[,11](#page-6-6) with the latter being supported by experimental evidence[.12](#page-6-7)

#### **Geographic Distribution of Human Plague**

A soil reservoir and the relative resistance of various rodent species may explain why plague regularly re-emerges in long-lasting plague foci in all continents except Antarctica and Oceania ([Fig. 77.3](#page-3-0)). During the last 15 years, at least eight geographic areas have experienced outbreaks of human plague after silent periods of 30 to 50 years: India in 1994, Zambia in 1996, Indonesia in 1997, Algeria in 2003 and 2009, Congo in 2005, Uganda in 2006, Libya and China in 2009, and Madagascar in 2017. Data indicate that 584 deaths and 3248 cases have been reported from 2010 to 2015[.13](#page-6-8) Plague can therefore be considered a re-emerging disease, mainly contracted during outdoor professional and recreational activities, and after consumption of contaminated food, contrary to what had been observed during the large historic urban outbreaks of the preceding centuries. In the United States, it has been shown

<span id="page-1-0"></span>that activities with close extended contacts with pet dogs (such as sleeping in the same bed as a pet dog in a plague-endemic area) are significantly associated with plague.[14](#page-6-9) In Europe, no human cases have been recently reported, but animal plague is still present along the western banks of the Caspian Sea. In all geographic areas, a seasonal pattern of human plague is observed, although the seasonal pattern is different from one geographic area to another, even within the same country[.7](#page-6-3)

#### **NATURAL HISTORY, PATHOGENESIS, AND PATHOLOGY**

#### *Yersinia pestis*

The gamma-proteobacteria *Y. pestis* (genome size, 4.60–4.65 Mb) may have emerged 20,000 years ago by reductive evolution from

![](_page_2_Figure_3.jpeg)

<span id="page-2-0"></span>Fig. 77.2 The sources and prevention of human plague.

Y. pseudotuberculosis (genome size, 4.72 Mb)<sup>15</sup>; Y. pestis DNA has been detected in Bronze Age buried individuals. 6 Genome sequencing has identified numerous insertion sequences, evidence of intragenomic recombination and lateral gene transfer, and remnants suggestive of a previous enteric life cycle. A 70- to 75-kb plasmid common to all pathogenic Yersinia species (termed pCD1, pCad, pVW, pYV, or pLcr plasmid) encodes a type III secretion system (Yops, for "Yersinia Outer Proteins") and V antigen. A 100- to 110-kb plasmid (termed pFra/Tox, pFra, pTox, pMT1, or pYT plasmid) encodes the capsular F1 glycoprotein antigen and the Yersinia murine toxin Ymt. A 9.5-kb plasmid (termed pPst, pPla, pPCP1, or pYP plasmid) encodes the plasminogen activator Pla (which is thought to promote the systemic spread of *Y. pestis* from peripheral sites) and pesticin, a bacteriocine involved in iron capture in mammalian hosts. Not all field isolates harbor the three plasmids, which are unstable during laboratory culture; new plasmids have been characterized, unsurprisingly illustrating the plasticity and ongoing evolution of Y. pestis. Other virulence factors encoded on the chromosome are associated with the lipopolysaccharide endotoxin and with iron uptake—giving the pigmentation of colonies grown on Congo red medium. Y. pestis is a non-sporulated, aerobic, gram-negative, oxidasenegative, urease-negative, catalase-positive bacillus growing

slowly at 28°C, pH 7.4. Biochemical profiling distinguishes nine biovars, which have been proposed as sub-species, including Y. pestis subsp. pestis and additional subspecies angola, altaica, caucasica, hissarica, quinghaiensis, talassica, ulegeica, and xilingolensis, organisms of unknown pathogenicity isolated from various rodent species in Angola (subspecies angola) and Central Asia.<sup>6</sup> Y. pestis subsp. pestis organism biotype Antiqua are glycerol and nitrate reduction-positive, Medievalis are glycerol positive and nitrate reduction-negative, and Orientalis are glycerol negative and nitrate reduction positive. Microtus biotype organisms have been proposed to include rhamnose-positive rodent strains, whereas rhamnose-positive, Antiqua-like isolates occasionally isolated from patients in China could form a fifth biotype: Intermedium.<sup>17</sup> Y. pestis subsp. pestis Orientalis isolates are unique in their capacity to stabilize a bacteriophage contributing to the pathogenicity in their chromosome.18

#### **Pathogenesis**

In humans, the ectoparasite's bite results in discrete local inflammation and spreading by the lymphatic route toward the regional lymph node. Overwhelming bacterial growth in the node results

in the so-called *bubo,* and *Y. pestis* can further disseminate via the lymphatic and blood vessels to the spleen and liver and can cause a rapidly fatal septicemia, with dissemination in the lung resulting in secondary pneumonic plague and in the meninges and cerebrospinal fluid (CSF), causing meningitis. Hematogenous dissemination of the bacteria to other organs and tissues may cause intra-vascular coagulation and endotoxic shock. During this process, *Y. pestis* rapidly multiplies in human tissues because it protects itself from the human immune system by serum resistance and evasion from innate immune functions. *Y. pestis* is a facultative intracellular bacterium that multiplies within macrophages[.17](#page-6-13)

#### **CLINICAL FEATURES OF PLAGUE**

People of all ages and both genders are susceptible to plague, although recently, most cases have been reported in children with a small predominance for males over the last decade.[7](#page-6-3) It remains controversial whether the CCR5Delta32 mutation, the one that confers resistance to HIV infection, also confers resistance to plague[.19](#page-6-15)

Bubonic plague is the most frequent clinical form, developing 2 to 10 days after inoculation of *Y. pestis*. Features include chills; fever; myalgias; arthralgias; weakness; and a painful, tender, swollen, enlarged lymph node referred to as a *bubo* draining the site of inoculation [\(Fig. 77.4\)](#page-4-0). The femoral and inguinal nodes are most frequently involved (bubo is Greek for "groin"), followed in frequency by axillary and cervical nodes. Careful examination may reveal local skin inflammation at the site of the ectoparasite's bite with a papule, pustule, scab, or ulcer. The bubo of plague is clinically distinguishable from enlarged lymph nodes due to other causes by its association with systemic signs of toxemia and its rapid onset. Moreover, plague is the only cause of clustered cases of febrile, enlarged lymph nodes, leading to its unambiguous diagnosis in this situation. Bubonic plague usually rapidly responds to appropriate antibiotic therapy, with the lymph node remaining enlarged and tender for 1 week. If untreated with an effective antibiotic, the patient will become increasingly toxic and will develop a septicemic form of plague, with a mortality risk of 50% to 90%.

Septicemic plague is usually secondary to the bubonic form and features a rapidly progressive, overwhelming toxemia. The patient may present with gastrointestinal symptoms, including nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, and abdominal pain, which may confuse the diagnosis. In the absence of rapid supportive therapy combined with effective antibiotic treatment, septicemic plague is fulminate and fatal.

Pneumonic plague is the most rapidly fatal form; the incubation period for primary pneumonic plague is 1 to 3 days after contact

Other clinical forms include meningeal plague, an unusual form following insufficiently treated bubonic plague. Pharyngitis is a rare form diagnosed in patients who consumed raw or poorly cooked contaminated meat, such as camel meat, and features anterior cervical lymphadenitis. Pleuritis, endophthalmitis, and myocarditis are exceptional forms of plague.

### **PATIENT EVALUATION, DIAGNOSIS, AND DIFFERENTIAL DIAGNOSIS**

Plague should be considered in any patient returning from, or living in, a country with active plague epizoonoses who presents with febrile adenitis. In this circumstance, it is useful to rapidly collect whole blood in three successive blood culture bottles, as well as sputum, urine, and lymph node fluid. Lymph node fluid can be sterilely obtained using saline for aspiration.[7](#page-6-3) More rarely, CSF could be collected if clinically indicated. Additional environmental specimens may include any ectoparasite found on the patient's body and clothes, as well as specimens from any animal suspected to be a potential source of infection. Clinical and environmental specimens should be handled in a Biosafety Level (BSL) 2 laboratory, but handling and culture of *Y. pestis* requires a BSL3 laboratory. Plague is usually a reportable and quarantinable disease covered by national and international health regulations.

Point-of-care diagnosis usually involves using a commercially available dipstick immunochromatographic assay detecting the F1 capsular antigen.[20](#page-6-16) This dipstick assay has been applied to urine, whole blood, bubo pus, and sputum. It takes a few minutes and exhibits a 98% specificity and 90% sensitivity for serum and 100% specificity and sensitivity for bubo fluid. Direct microscopic examination of clinical specimens after Gram staining is another technique for the rapid diagnosis of plague and involves detection of gram-negative bacilli exhibiting a characteristic bipolar staining with a "hairpin appearance" [\(Fig. 77.5](#page-4-1)). Polymerase chain reaction– based assays are also available.[21](#page-6-17)

Isolation and culture of *Y. pestis* is performed by incubating cultures at 32°C under a 5% CO2 atmosphere for 1 to 4 days. Because slow growth is observed on MacConkey agar, other selective media, including the cefsulodin-irgasan-novobiocin and beef heart-irgasan-novobiocin agar have been developed[.22](#page-6-18) The

<span id="page-4-1"></span>identification of *Y. pestis* can be achieved rapidly using immunochromatographic detection of the F1 antigen on colonies.[23](#page-6-19) Rapid identification using peptidic profiling by mass spectrometry is also effective.[24](#page-6-20)

Antibiotic susceptibility testing should be performed, as a few antibiotic-resistant strains have emerged in Madagascar.[25](#page-6-21) One strain was resistant to eight antimicrobial agents, including those recommended for therapy (streptomycin, chloramphenicol, and tetracycline) and prophylaxis (sulfonamide and tetracycline), as well as ampicillin, kanamycin, and spectinomycin. A second strain was only resistant to streptomycin. In these strains, all of the resistance genes were carried by conjugative plasmids of approximately 150 kb and 40 kb, respectively[.25](#page-6-21) Horizontal gene transfer in the flea may be the source of antibiotic-resistant *Y. pestis* strains isolated from plague patients in Madagascar.[25](#page-6-21) Ampicillin- and tetracycline-resistant isolates have been identified in fleas and rats in Madagascar[,25](#page-6-21) whereas the 150-kd plasmid backbone was shown to be broadly disseminated among multi-drug–resistant zoonotic

pathogens associated with agriculture.[26](#page-6-22) Experimental data indicate that *Y. pestis* strains resistant to fluoroquinolones could be easily selected in the laboratory, but such strains have not been found in the clinical setting.

Typing of *Y. pestis* is done by testing nitrate reduction, glycerol assimilation, and rhamnose assimilation to determine biotyp[e17;](#page-6-13) molecular typing can be done by single nucleotide polymorphism analysis, regions of deletion analysis, clustered regularly interspaced short palindromic repeats analysis, multiple loci variable number of tandem repeats (VNTR) analysis[,17](#page-6-13) multi-locus sequence typing, restriction fragment length polymorphism analysis and multi-spacer sequence typing analysis[.3](#page-6-0) VNTR analysis has proved useful in identifying sources of human exposure.[27](#page-6-23)

Serology using modern techniques is useful to measure seroprevalence in sentinel animals and could be used for the rapid diagnosis of patients for whom serum is the only available specimen during outbreaks[.28](#page-6-24)

#### **TREATMENT**

Rapid administration of an effective antibiotic to patients with suspected plague is mandatory. Streptomycin, the historical reference antibiotic still used in Madagascar, is no longer available in most countries. Gentamicin alone or in combination with a tetracycline is an acceptable substitut[e29](#page-6-25) [\(Table 77.1](#page-5-2)). Gentamicin and doxycycline were shown to be equivalent in curing patients, except in terminal-stage disease.[30](#page-6-26) Fluoroquinolones, as well as cephalosporins, are effective in animal models, yet they are not recommended, as, with the exception of a single reported case of plague successfully treated with ciprofloxacin[,7](#page-6-3) there are no clinical data addressing their efficacy. Antibiotic treatment should be continued for 10 days. Improvement is clinically evident 2 to 3 days after initiation of antibiotics, although fever may persist for a few more days. Supportive therapy should be undertaken in case of septic shock and septicemic plague.

#### **PREVENTION AND CONTROL**

Before exposure to *Y. pestis,* primary prevention relies on avoiding areas with known epizootic plague; avoiding apparently sick and dead animals; reporting such animals to the health department and avoiding exposure to rats and fleas from diseased rats or other rodents, including use of protective clothes and repellents to avoid exposure to ectoparasites when outdoors; applying insect repellent containing N,N-Diethyl-meta-toluamide to legs and ankles; applying repellents and insecticides to clothes and outer bedding; using gloves for the manipulation of dead animals and carcasses; and cooking meat on an open-flame grill or on a clam-shell type electric grill.[31](#page-6-27)

Vaccines (live attenuated *Y. pestis* EV76 strain; formalininactivated, whole-cell plague; heat-killed whole-cell plague; F1 fraction) can be administrated by aerosol (EV76), subcutaneously (EV76; heat-killed CSL vaccine; CSL Ltd., Victoria, Australia), or intramuscularly (formalin-inactivated Greer vaccine; Greer Laboratories, Inc., North Carolina, USA).[32](#page-6-28) The F1 fraction vaccine appears to have relatively low efficacy (<60%) and side effects in 35% of vaccinees. There is not enough evidence to evaluate the effectiveness of any plague vaccine or the relative effectiveness between vaccines and their tolerability. Circumstantial data from observational studies suggest that killed vaccines may be more effective against bubonic plague and have fewer adverse effects than attenuated vaccines. No evidence is available regarding the long-term effects of any plague vaccine and their role in controlling plague outbreaks[.32](#page-6-28)

In the case of potential exposure to *Y. pestis,* secondary prevention relies on the administration of a tetracycline or trimethoprimsulfamethoxazole to people who are bitten by fleas during a local outbreak or who are exposed to tissues or fluids from a plagueinfected animal, people living in a household with a bubonic plague patient (as they may also be exposed to infected fleas), and people in close contact with a person or pet with suspected pneumonic plague[.29](#page-6-25) Recent evaluation indicates that doxycycline should be considered a first-line antibiotic in the management of bioterrorism agents, including *Y. pestis*. [33](#page-6-29) For a mass casualty situation, oral therapy with doxycycline, tetracycline, or ciprofloxacin has been recommended,[2](#page-5-1) with the latter option being supported by animal models. Prevention of human-to-human transmission from patients with pneumonic plague can be achieved by implementing standard isolation procedures until at least 4 days after the initiation of antibiotic treatment.

Control of plague is based on active surveillance of sentinel animals. In areas with epizootic outbreaks, it is mandatory to eliminate food and shelter for rodents around homes, workplaces, and certain recreational areas, such as picnic sites or campgrounds where people congregate. Remove brush, rock piles, junk, and food sources, including pet food. Treat pets (cats and dogs) for flea control regularly. Likewise, the control of a human plague outbreak mainly relies on the rapid confirmation of the diagnosis and treatment of confirmed and suspected cases. Killing any human ectoparasite is mandatory during plague outbreaks, as well as killing animal fleas using appropriate and licensed insecticides.
