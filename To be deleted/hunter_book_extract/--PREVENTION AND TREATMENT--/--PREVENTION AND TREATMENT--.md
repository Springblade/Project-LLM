In patients diagnosed with RRV disease but in whom symptoms last longer than 3 to 6 months, other differential diagnoses should be actively sought. In a survey of RRV disease patients, about half the patients reported disease lasting longer than 6 months. However, in nearly all these patients, other rheumatic conditions (primarily autoimmune) or depression were subsequently diagnosed.[8](#page-0-3) There is no evidence that RRV disease predisposes to other rheumatic diseases,[8](#page-0-3) but it may contribute to post-infective depression or fatigue.[10](#page-0-4)

### **PREVENTION AND TREATMENT**

Preventing mosquito bites prevents RRV infection. Insect repellants containing DEET are recommended (except for infants <2 months). Insect screens; bed nets; and long-sleeved, loose-fitting, lightcolored clothes are also protective.

RRV disease is generally treated with paracetamol or nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs), with many patients being satisfied with this treatment[.8,9](#page-0-3) Anecdotal evidence suggests different NSAIDs may need to be tried[.2](#page-0-0) Standard risks and contraindications for NSAID use in patients with conditions including asthma, peptic ulcer, cardiovascular and renal disease should be considered. Aspirin is used by some patients (but is not recommended for chikungunya[4](#page-0-1) ). Steroids are not generally recommended.[11](#page-0-5) Although a vaccine has been tested in phase III human trials[,7](#page-0-2) this is not commercially available.

# **36.6** Oropouche Virus

*Marcio R. T. Nunes, Pedro F. C. Vasconcelos*

## KEY FEATURES

- • The most prevalent arboviral disease in South America, after dengue and chikungunya fever viruses.
- • More than 30 epidemics reported in the last three decades in the Brazilian Amazon region, Peru, Panama, and Trinidad and Tobago, with an estimated occurrence of over 500,000 infections.
- • Clinical picture caused by Oropouche fever virus is an acute febrile disease with headache, chills, myalgia, nausea/vomiting, retro-ocular pain, and dizziness.
- • Some patients develop aseptic meningitis, and virus can be recovered from blood but also from cerebrospinal fluid.
- • Four genotypes of Oropouche fever virus (I, II, III, and IV) are recognized.
- • Urban cycle is responsible for outbreaks and transmission, and is transmitted by the midge *Culicoides paraensis*.
- • Diagnosing of Oropouche fever virus is by IgM enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) virus isolation and molecular biology techniques, mainly reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) and real-time PCR, and nucleotide sequencing.
- • There is no vaccine available to prevent Oropouche fever virus, and personal protection is recommended during epidemics.

# **INTRODUCTION**

Oropouche virus (OROV), a member of the *Orthobunyavirus* genus in the Peribunyaviridae family, is the causative agent of Oropouche fever.[1,2](#page--1-0) The first case of Oropouche fever was described in 1955, when the virus was isolated from the blood sample of a febrile patient in the West Indies and from a pool of *Coquillettidia venezuelensis* mosquitoes. A large epidemic was recorded in the 1960s in Belém, Brazil, involving an estimated 11,000 people.[1](#page--1-0) Over the past five decades, it is estimated that more than half a million people have been infected by the virus in the tropical areas of South and Central America, mainly in the Amazon region of Brazil and Peru[.3,4](#page--1-1)

#### **EPIDEMIOLOGY**

OROV has been found in Brazil, Panama, Peru, and Trinidad and Tobago, and is basically maintained by two different life cycles. One occurs in urban areas of tropical cities in the Amazon basin and involves humans as the vertebrate hosts, with *Culicoides paraensis* midges as the major arthropod vector. Transmission in general occurs outdoor in the daytime, especially during sunrise and sunset. The other described life cycle is sylvatic and not well understood and is based on serologic prevalence involving wild mammals (especially sloths and monkeys) and birds as the potential vertebrate hosts. The arthropod vector in the sylvatic life cycle is unknown, but may include *C. paraensis*.

Many outbreaks of Oropouche fever have been characterized by epidemics spreading in numerous villages within one geographic area and over a short period; these episodes essentially occur in new colonized areas and in the suburbs of large Amazonian urban
