# **EPIDEMIOLOGY**

The distribution and transmission of HDV infection has three patterns: (1) endemic and associated with non-parenteral spread in Italy, other Mediterranean countries, and the Middle East; (2) endemic-epidemic in the Amazon area and other remote areas of South America; and (3) sporadic and associated with parenteral transmission in almost all other geographic areas. Like HBV and HCV, HDV is parenterally transmitted.[4](#page-0-0) HDV in developed countries is most prevalent in certain high-risk groups (e.g., intravenous drug users). It can be transmitted both sexually and through non-sexual household contacts; the latter is the most common route of transmission in indigenous populations in South America, Africa, and parts of Central and Southeast Asia.

# **CLINICAL FEATURES AND NATURAL HISTORY**

After an incubation of 4 to 8 weeks, there is a viral hepatitis syndrome that is generally more severe than with other hepatitis viruses and that may be fulminant. When HDV and HBV *co-infection* occurs, recovery is the rule. In contrast, HDV *superinfection* of chronic hepatitis B persists in more than 60% of patients and is associated with a threefold increased rate of progression to cirrhosis[.4](#page-0-0)

A retrospective study of 188 Italian patients studied the impact of viral and patient features on survival[.5](#page-0-1) Eighty-two patients (43%) had chronic hepatitis at histology; the remaining 106 individuals had a clinical/histologic diagnosis of cirrhosis. Ninety-six patients received interferon or lamivudine therapy, and 27 (30%) attained a sustained viral cure. During follow-up, 21 of the treated patients with chronic hepatitis progressed to cirrhosis. Of the 127 cirrhotic patients, hepatic decompensation occurred in 33% and HCC in 13%. The 5- and 10-year survival-free events were 96.8% and 81.9%, respectively, for patients with chronic hepatitis, and 83.9% and 59.4% for those with cirrhosis. Lack of anti-viral therapy, cirrhosis at presentation, and male sex independently predicted a worse outcome. Interferon therapy was recommended to slow or alter the natural course of liver disease, although sustained remission with interferon therapy is only modest.[5](#page-0-1)

## **DIAGNOSIS**

Acute HDV and HBV *co-infection* is recognized by transient detection of HDAg or, more often, antibody to HDAg (anti-HD) with the typical serologic profile for acute HBV infection. Within months of infection, there may be no serologic evidence of HDV co-infection*.* HDV *superinfection* is recognized by anti-HD (IgG or IgM) and/or HDV RNA or HDAg; persistent detection of these signifies chronic infection.

## **PREVENTION**

There is no anti-viral treatment for HDV. HDV infection is deterred by prevention of HBV infection using its vaccine.

# KEY FEATURES

- • Parenterally transmitted virus that infects 71 million (1%) people, most in lesser developed countries[.1](#page-3-0)
- • Most new infections in developed countries are due to intravenous drug use, but multiple causes of transmission are present, including unsterile injections from health care providers and familial exposures in less developed countries.
- • The majority of those infected (70%–80%) develop chronic hepatitis, 15% to 20% of whom develop cirrhosis and hepatocellular carcinoma over decades.
- • Treatment of chronic HCV infection has improved considerably in the last few years, with a considerable improvement in efficacy and reduction of side effects.
- • There is no licensed vaccine for HCV.

## **INTRODUCTION**

HCV was cloned and sequenced in 1989.[2,3](#page-3-1) Shortly thereafter assays were developed to detect HCV RNA and antibodies.[4](#page-4-0) Huge epidemics of both HCV and HBV occurred in some countries after well-intended efforts to control endemic infectious diseases (schistosomiasis, sleeping sickness, malaria) during the middle of the 20th century.[5,6](#page-4-1)

The majority of initial infections are asymptomatic[.7,8](#page-4-2) Chronic infections have a prolonged asymptomatic chronic hepatitis phase that may progress over 15 to 35 years to cirrhosis and HCC[.9](#page-4-3) Unlike for HBV, there is no preventive vaccine for HCV.[10,11](#page-4-4) Prior therapy was prolonged, toxic, complex, and only modestly effective.[12](#page-4-5) New therapies have improved considerably with high efficacy and few side effects[.13](#page-4-6)

The virus is a single-stranded, positive-sense RNA virus in the genus *Flavivirus,* family Flaviviridae*.* [14](#page-4-7) It has an RNA polymerase that lacks a proofreading ability and has a replication rate of an estimated 1012 virions per day, thereby making it potentially possible to generate a mutation in every single position of the genome in one infected host every day[.15](#page-4-8) Within an individual there are innumerable HCV variants that constitute a quasi-species, whose presence often confounds the immune response and complicates vaccine development[.16](#page-4-9)

# **EPIDEMIOLOGY**

## **Distribution**

HCV infection rates increase with age and are much higher in high-risk groups. The World Health Organization (WHO) estimates that 1% of the world's population has been infected with HCV and that 71 million persons are chronic carrier[s1](#page-3-0) [\(Fig.](#page-1-0) [35.4.1](#page-1-0)). There may be 8 million carriers in Egypt alone; nearly 4 million Americans are infected with HCV, with an estimated 17,000 new infections each year, and it is believed to be responsible for the deaths of 10,000 Americans annually[.6,17,18](#page-4-10)

# **Transmission**

Sharing of needles by injecting illicit drugs accounts for most HCV cases in developed countries[.9,17](#page-4-3) Inhabitants of developing countries are usually infected from parenteral exposures from injections and other activities that penetrate the skin, inadequate screening of blood and blood products before transfusion, during renal dialysis, and from "interfamilial exposures."[19,20–23](#page-4-11)

In countries with high rates of HCV infections, transfusions remain risky because there is inadequate screening of blood or blood products for HCV. From 2% to 6% of infants born to HCV-infected mothers have persistent infections[.24,25](#page-4-12) In children, perinatal transmission is the most common route of transmission in developed countries,[26,27](#page-4-13) though breastfeeding is not an important transmission route.[25,28](#page-4-14) Assessment of infant HCV infection should include HCV RNA detection, because antibody-negative infection has been documented and maternal HCV antibodies are passively transferred to infants[.24](#page-4-12) Sexual transmission of HCV also occurs but with low frequency.[29](#page-4-15) In over one-third of HCV infections no specific exposure is identified.

The high prevalence in Egypt and equatorial Africa is believed to be due to various percutaneous exposures. For example, from the 1950s to the 1970s the Egyptian government sponsored a national schistosomiasis control program that used intravenous tartar emetic in mass treatment campaigns, and health care providers in the Central African Republic and Cameroon during the same period treated and controlled African trypanosomiasis, malaria, and other endemic infectious diseases with intravenous medications.[5,20](#page-4-1) Exposure to blood by injections from conventional and traditional village health workers, dental procedures, cuts from barbers, male and female circumcisions, and other activities are believed to continue HCV transmission in communities with a large HCV reservoir[.19,20–23,30](#page-4-11)

#### Prevalence of hepatitis C virus infection

![](_page_1_Figure_9.jpeg)

<span id="page-1-0"></span>**Fig. 35.4.1** Estimated prevalence of hepatitis C virus infection. (From [https://wwwnc.cdc.gov/travel/](https://wwwnc.cdc.gov/travel/yellowbook/2018/infectious-diseases-related-to-travel/hepatitis-c) [yellowbook/2018/infectious-diseases-related-to-travel/hepatitis-c](https://wwwnc.cdc.gov/travel/yellowbook/2018/infectious-diseases-related-to-travel/hepatitis-c).)

# **PATHOGENESIS AND PATHOLOGY**

Individuals with chronic hepatitis C generally have lymphocytic inflammation with lymphoid aggregation in portal tracts. There may also be microvesicular fatty changes and damage to bile ducts and acidophilic changes in hepatocytes—histologic findings that may also occur with HBV infection but are more characteristic of hepatitis C. Cirrhosis may also be present, being associated with a long duration of infection[.31](#page-4-16)

# **CLINICAL FEATURES**

# **Acute Infection**

The onset of HCV infection is usually unrecognized[.32](#page-4-17) Within 1 to 3 weeks of exposure, HCV RNA can be detected in blood. Transaminases may become elevated 3 to 9 weeks (average 50 days) later, but only 20% to 25% are jaundiced or are symptomatic, which tends to be mild. The mean incubation period until the onset of symptoms is 7 weeks, and clinical illness usually lasts from 2 to 12 weeks with ALT and AST returning to normal and HCV RNA becoming undetectable within that time. Fulminating hepatitis from HCV infection is rare[.32](#page-4-17)

# **Chronic Infection**

HCV RNA can be persistent in 60% to 80% of patients after exposure[.9](#page-4-3) The chronic HCV carrier often has intermittent elevations in transaminases and mild jaundice.[33](#page-4-18) Liver biopsies in HCV-positive patients with persistently normal ALT levels usually reveal evidence of inflammation and have better prognosis. Clinical symptoms or signs of liver disease tend to initially be non-specific, mild, and intermittent, with fatigue described as lethargy, malaise, lack of energy, anorexia, nausea, arthralgia, myalgia, weakness, and weight loss.[9](#page-4-3)

Many chronic HCV carriers are asymptomatic. The duration of infection and co-factors (e.g., use of alcohol, concurrent HIV-1 infection, or the HCV genotype causing the infection) may affect hepatitis C prognosis, which remains unpredictable[.34](#page-4-19)

# Cirrhosis

From 10% to 20% of HCV-infected patients develop cirrhosis over a period of 15 to 30 years. Once cirrhosis develops, marked fatigue, muscle weakness and wasting, fluid retention with edema and ascites, easy bruising, dark urine, jaundice, itching, and upper gastrointestinal hemorrhage can occur. Hepatic failure is more likely in those with additional causes of liver disease (e.g., schistosomiasis, concomitant HBV or HIV, and alcoholic liver disease). Staging of the fibrosis as detected on liver biopsy can predict clinical outcomes, need for liver transplantation, and liver-related death[.35](#page-4-20)

## Hepatocellular Carcinoma

The annual incidence of HCC is 2% to 3% in those who have cirrhosis.[36,37](#page-4-21) There are geographic differences in the incidence of HCV-caused HCC, perhaps due to the length of time HCV has been transmitted in the local area or to differences in the prevalence of other HCC-causing cofactors.

## **Extrahepatic Complications**

HCV infection has been associated with several extrahepatic syndromes, including essential mixed cryoglobulinemia (with or without vasculitis) and membranoproliferative glomerulonephritis. There are also reported correlations of HCV infection with arthritis, type 2 diabetes mellitus, keratoconjunctivitis sicca, lymphoma, Hashimoto's thyroiditis, lichen planus, and porphyria cutanea tarda.

## Essential Mixed Cryoglobulinemia

Hepatitis C appears to be the most common cause of this syndrome, which is marked by varying combinations of fatigue, myalgia, arthralgia and arthritis, hives, purpura or vasculitis, neuropathy, and glomerulonephritis.[38](#page-4-22) Cryoglobulins, composed of immune complexes of HCV and anti-HCV, immunoglobulins, rheumatoid factor, and complement, are present in the serum. Cryoglobulins are detectable in up to one-third of patients with chronic HCV, but the clinical syndrome of essential mixed cryoglobulinemia occurs in less than 2%.

# Non-Hodgkin's Lymphoma

Chronic HCV infection is a risk factor for non-Hodgkin's lymphoma (NHL).[39](#page-4-23) Case series studies had a higher-than-expected prevalence of NHL in patients with essential mixed cryoglobulinemia and chronic HCV infection.

# **DIAGNOSIS**

The detection of anti-HCV in plasma or serum indicates prior or current infection, and RNA detection using reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) assays can quantitate the virus.[40](#page-4-24) About 60% to 80% of those who are positive by the third-generation enzyme immunosorbent assay (EIA) tests are also positive by RT-PCR and are considered to have active HCV infections. The remaining 20% to 40% of anti-HCV–positive subjects who are RT-PCR negative have usually cleared their viremia.

Detection of HCV RNA indicates ongoing infection and transmissibility. Studies of perinatal hepatitis C have demonstrated that anti-HCV–positive, HCV-RNA–negative mothers do not transmit infection to their infants, whereas HCV-RNA–positive mothers can[.24](#page-4-12) HCV RNA may rarely be detected in anti-HCV– negative individuals, mostly in the acute phase of infection. RT-PCR can be used to determine HCV genotypes and viral load. Also, the quantity of HCV RNA correlates with perinatal and sexual transmission.

## **TREATMENT**

## **Justification for Treatment**

Sixty percent to eighty percent of individuals with acute hepatitis C progress to chronic infections[.40](#page-4-24) Spontaneous resolution is more common among infected infants, children and young women, those who have jaundice, and those who have the IL-28B C/C genotype (described later).[22,24](#page-4-25) Spontaneous clearance of acute HCV infection and therapeutic response of patients with chronic hepatitis C to the older therapy with pegylated interferon is associated with a single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) upstream of the IL-28B gene.[41,42](#page-4-26) Spontaneous clearance of infection was much more common in patients with the C/C genotype (64%) than in the C/T genotype (24%) and rare in those with the T/T genotype (6%). There are racial differences in spontaneous clearance of acute HCV and sustained viral response after treatment with pegylated interferon alpha a or b (PEG) and ribavirin, with black patients having poorer responses than Caucasians, which is likely reflective of the higher prevalence of the IL-28B C/C haplotype in Caucasians. Current therapies with directly acting anti-viral (DAA) oral regimens are not affected by the host's IL-28B gene or the viral genotype (pangenotypic).

People with HCV-related cirrhosis are at 30% risk over 10 years of developing hepatic decompensation, as well as HCC (1%–3%

# **Therapeutic Goals**

Therapy is given to eliminate infection and prevent overall mortality.[40,43,44](#page-4-24)

## **Therapeutic Regimens**

Starting in the 1990s HCV treatment consisted of parenteral interferon and oral ribavirin, with a modest cure rate. Although the cure rate gradually improved for the next two decades, this therapy was toxic, was prolonged, was genotype-dependent, and was, at best, successful in 50% to 60% of patients. It required 24 to 48 weeks of treatment, and the patient had to be followed for another 24 weeks to confirm a sustained viral response as evidence of a complete cure (SVR-24).

A series of major breakthroughs started in 2009 with the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) approval of two oral protease inhibitors, boceprevir and telaprevir, which were combined with pegylated interferon and ribavirin.[45–47](#page-4-27) This improved the cure rate to 70% to 75% but with numerous side effects. In 2013 the FDA approved two highly effective drugs, sofosbuvir (a nucleotide analog NS5B polymerase inhibitor) and simeprevir (protease inhibitor), which improved the response rate to 90%, but still in combination with pegylated interferon and ribavirin. The next year (2014) ushered in a new era, where the FDA approved the first all-oral direct acting antiviral (DAA) therapeutic regimens (without interferon or ribavirin) that had very high success rates, few side effects, and shorter duration of treatment (12 weeks), with a shorter 12-week follow-up period to confirm sustained viral response (SVR-12). Since then several new drugs and drug combinations have been approved ([Table 35.4.1\)](#page-3-3). Whereas all of these were approved for adults, in 2017, the FDA approved the first DAAs for the treatment of chronic HCV infection in adolescents aged 12 to 17 years: sofosbuvir/ledipasvir for genotypes 1, 4, 5, or 6, and sofosbuvir plus ribavirin for genotypes 2 or 3.

The vast numbers of HCV therapies available now are truly remarkable and provide the clinician with a wide range of therapies that can be tailored to each patient's condition. All regimens are well tolerated and achieve cure rates in most treated patients. Expansion of HCV treatment globally depends on the availability of cheaper, effective generic medications, as demonstrated in the case of HIV infection.

# **Treatment of Acute Hepatitis C**

A minority of acute HCV infections are diagnosed, but up to half of patients with symptomatic acute hepatitis C spontaneously clear their infections, usually within 12 weeks. Before the current all-oral DAA therapies, treatment with standard pegylated monotherapy was the gold standard, where the cure rate was better than 80%. With the advent of DAAs, the exposed asymptomatic or symptomatic patient should be tested for anti-HCV antibody and HCV RNA every 4 to 8 weeks for 6 to 12 months until chronic infection is confirmed, then treatment with DAA should be started. Preexposure or post-exposure prophylaxis with anti-viral therapy is not recommended[.48](#page-4-28)

# **PREVENTION AND CONTROL**

Dramatic reductions in post-transfusion hepatitis C occurred after the institution of screening of blood donors for HCV antibodies and HCV RNA, which were highly effective in developed countries but not as rigorously applied in developing countries. Activities in the communities, for example, cuts from barbers, dental procedures, and injections from traditional healers as well as health care providers, all may transmit HCV and can be influenced by appropriate health education.[20](#page-4-29)

There is no available vaccine to prevent HCV infection, and, due to the extent of viral heterogeneity, a universally effective HCV vaccine will be difficult to develop[.10](#page-4-4)
