# **<sup>123</sup> 123** Abdominal Angiostrongyliasis

*Carlos Graeff-Teixeira, Rubens Rodriguez*

## KEY FEATURES

- • The life cycle involves rodents (definitive hosts) and mollusks (intermediate hosts).
- • Human infection mostly occurs in Central and South America.
- • Characterized by granulomatous inflammation with eosinophilic infiltration of the intestinal wall and mesenteric arteries.
- • Avoid ingesting slugs and raw food and water that may be contaminated with slugs or slug secretions.
- • There is no specific anti-parasitic therapy; surgical treatment may be necessary.

#### **INTRODUCTION**

Abdominal angiostrongyliasis, caused by *Angiostrongylus costaricensis* and also known as *eosinophilic gastroenteritis,* is characterized by a granulomatous inflammatory reaction with heavy eosinophilic infiltration of the intestinal wall, especially in the ileocecal region. The disease has occurred in Costa Rica since 195[21](#page-2-0) ; since 1971, it has been reported from most countries of the Americas, especially Central and South America. Cotton rats, raccoons, opossums, and primates naturally infected with the parasite have been found in the United States[.2](#page-2-1) *A. siamensis* in Asia is a potential cause for eosinophilic gastroenteritis in primates, but no human infection has been documented.

#### **EPIDEMIOLOGY**

The disease has been reported from the United States to Argentina, including some Caribbean islands. Travelers to endemic areas can present with the disease on their return. Both adults and children are affected, but in some areas, it may be predominantly a pediatric disease. In temperate areas of southern Brazil, transmission is focal and also shows seasonality, with higher infection risk for humans in spring and summer.[3](#page-2-2) Lethality is low (1.3%–7.4%).[3,4](#page-2-2)

## **NATURAL HISTORY, PATHOGENESIS, AND PATHOLOGY**

*A. costaricensis* is a filariform nematode normally living within the mesenteric arteries of the definitive host—a rodent. The female is 33 mm long with vulva and anus located near the caudal end; the male is 20 mm long with a copulatory bursa and two spicules approximately 300 µm in length[.1](#page-2-0) Eggs are released within the mesenteric arteries and carried by the blood into the intestinal wall, where they embryonate ([Fig. 123.1](#page-1-0)). First-stage larvae hatch and migrate through the intestinal wall. They are excreted in the rodent's feces and reach the soil, where they are eaten by the intermediate host—usually slugs. Two molts take place in the mollusk and, after 18 days, the infective third-stage larva matures. Wild rodents become infected by eating the mollusk. The pre-patent period lasts 24 days[.1,5](#page-2-0)

In Costa Rica, the cotton rat, *Sigmodon hispidus,* is the most important host, but at least 12 different species of rodents and several other wild animals have been found to be naturally infected in the Americas.

Although several mollusks are infected with *A. costaricensis,* veronicellid slugs are considered the main intermediate hosts. At least two species of veronicellid slugs in Costa Rica (*Saranisula plebeia* and *Diplosolenodes occidentalis*) and several species in Brazil (e.g., *Phyllocaulis variegatus* and *S. linguaeformis*) are naturally infected.

Humans acquire the parasite when they ingest slugs or food items contaminated with small mollusks or their secretions, for example, small slugs hidden in salad greens could be finely chopped and inadvertently eaten raw. Several cases have followed ingestion of mollusks by infants. Most human infections are probably caused by ingestion of the infective larvae shed in the mollusk's secretions (see [Fig. 123.1](#page-1-0)). Slugs have been found in ripe fruits that have fallen to the ground. Characteristic mucus trails left by the mollusks can be observed throughout endemic areas. The propensity for small children to put things in their mouths could explain why they have the highest infection rates. Bleach (1.5%) solution is recommended for disinfection of vegetables[.6](#page-2-3)

In most cases, lesions caused by *A. costaricensis* are located in the ileocecal region. They can also occur in the hepatic flexure and descending colon, regional lymph nodes, liver, and testicles. Two major pathogenic mechanisms are present: (1) the adult worms living within the mesenteric arteries [\(Fig. 123.2](#page-1-1)) induce thrombosis and, consequently, necrosis of the tissues perfused by the vessels; and (2) eggs, embryos, and larvae, as well as excretion-secretion products, trigger inflammatory reactions. These features, as well as the patient's susceptibility and the number and localization of parasites, determine the pathophysiology of the infection.

#### **Intestinal Lesions**

Gross pathology shows a hardened and thickened intestinal wall. The intestinal lumen is reduced, sometimes causing partial or complete obstruction. Necrotic areas can perforate. In many cases, cecal lesions are detected during an appendectomy. Histopathology demonstrates heavy eosinophilic infiltration, including arterial walls, and granulomatous inflammatory reactions.[7](#page-2-4) Eosinophilic arteritis ([Fig. 123.3\)](#page-1-2), sometimes with granulomatous reaction in the arterial wall ([Fig. 123.4](#page-1-3)), is a very suggestive lesion. Eggs ([Fig. 123.5](#page-2-5)), embryos, and larvae may be detected amid granulomatous reaction. Unfertilized eggs usually degenerate and are difficult to recognize. Large areas of necrosis are caused by arterial thrombosis.

#### **Extra-Intestinal Lesions**

Eggs and embryos are present in the mesenteric lymph nodes, which show reticuloendothelial hyperplasia and eosinophilic infiltration. Other tissue-dwelling parasites usually affecting the hepatic parenchyma, like *Toxocara canis* (Chapter 120) should be considered in differential diagnosis.[8](#page-2-6) However, the finding of eggs (see [Fig. 123.5\)](#page-2-5), larvae, and even adult worms in the hepatic parenchyma establishes the diagnosis.

#### **CLINICAL FEATURES**

When worms are located in the ileocecal region, most patients complain of pain in the right iliac fossa and the right flank, and will have pain on palpation in this area. Rectal examination is painful in about 50% of patients, and most present with fever of

An important finding is the palpation of a tumorlike mass in the right lower quadrant that can be confused with a malignancy. Although a few patients have no hematologic abnormalities, leukocytosis and eosinophilia are usually present. White blood cell counts usually range between 15,000 and 50,000/mm3 and eosinophilia from 20% to 50%. Leukocytosis has been as high as 169,000/mm3 , with a 91% eosinophilia.

#### **Extra-Intestinal Findings**

Sometimes the patient complains of pain in the right upper quadrant. In these cases, the liver is almost always enlarged and tender to palpation.[8](#page-2-6) At laparoscopy, small yellowish spots

When the testicle is involved, the patient experiences acute pain, accompanied by redness and then purple discoloration. Eosinophilia and leukocytosis are also conspicuous. All patients with testicular necrosis have been misdiagnosed as having testicular torsion—the correct diagnosis being made only after surgery.

#### **PATIENT EVALUATION, DIAGNOSIS, AND DIFFERENTIAL DIAGNOSIS**

The clinical diagnosis is based on characteristic features and an appropriate exposure history. Symptoms can be confused with those of appendicitis—the appendix is frequently involved, with the diagnosis made at surgery. Imaging can demonstrate suggestive findings usually localized in the terminal ileum, cecum, appendix, and ascending colon. The lumen is reduced by the thickening of the intestinal wall and often resembles colon carcinoma. Eggs and larvae do not appear in the stools.

#### **TREATMENT**

Surgery is sometimes required for abdominal angiostrongyliasis. However, as knowledge of this often self-limiting disease increases, more cases have been followed without surgery. There are no clinical trials demonstrating efficacy of anti-parasitic drugs.[11](#page-2-8) In vitro and in vivo trials in experimentally infected rats demonstrate that parasites can be excited, rather than killed, by the drugs, causing erratic migrations and worsening of the lesions. Thus chemotherapy is not currently recommended.
