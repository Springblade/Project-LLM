## (*Angiostrongylus cantonensis, Parastrongylus cantonensis*)

*Prakaykaew Charunwatthana, Yupaporn Wattanagoon*

#### KEY FEATURES

- • *Anigostrongylus* is the most common parasitic cause of eosinophilic meningitis.
- • The parasite is usually acquired through eating raw snails. Humans have also been infected by ingesting uncooked paratenic hosts, such as freshwater prawns, crabs, frogs, and monitor lizards. Contaminated vegetables and fruits can be sources of transmission.
- • Occasionally, the worm can reach the eye and cause ocular angiostrongyliasis.
- • Pathologic changes include infiltration of lymphocytes, eosinophils, and plasma cells in the meninges. Granuloma formation occurs around dead parasites.
- • Treatment is often symptomatic. Corticosteroids reduce the duration of headache and the number of lumbar punctures. Combining albendazole and mebendazole with corticosteroids gives similar results to treatment with corticosteroids alone.

#### **INTRODUCTION**

The rat lung worm *Angiostrongylus cantonensis* (*Parastrongylus cantonensis*), primarily a parasite of rodents, is responsible for most human cases of eosinophilic meningitis and meningoencephalitis. The parasite was discovered in China in 1935, and human angiostrongyliasis was first reported in Taiwan in 1945.

#### **EPIDEMIOLOGY**

*A. cantonensis* is found mainly in Southeast Asia and throughout the Pacific basin, including Hawaii, Indonesia, the Philippines, Japan, and Papua New Guinea. More than 3000 human cases have been reported from tropical and subtropical areas. This number is likely to be an underestimate, as many infections are subclinical or occur in places where specific diagnostic testing is not performed. A growing number of travelers have been diagnosed after returning from endemic areas.[1](#page-2-0)

#### **NATURAL HISTORY, PATHOGENESIS, AND PATHOLOGY**

Humans are an accidental host; worms develop into late-stage larvae without being able to develop into adults. Human infection with rat lungworm occurs after ingestion of third-stage larvae of *A. cantonesis* in undercooked intermediate hosts such as snails or slugs. Paratenic hosts are also sources of infection, including prawns, crabs, frogs, or monitor lizards. Contaminated fruits, vegetables, and drinking water are occasional sources.

In Thailand, infection usually occurs as small outbreaks in communities that eat raw or undercooked *Pila* snails. After ingestion, larvae are released in the intestine and invade the intestinal wall. They enter the circulation; pass through the liver, heart, and lungs; and finally move to the brain. In humans, the larvae will molt into fourth-stage larvae but will not develop further and usually die in the brain after 1 to 2 months. Occasionally, larvae invade the orbits causing ocular disease.

Pathologic changes involve an inflammatory response to the presence or movement of larvae in the brain ([Fig. 122.1](#page-1-0)). Lymphocytes, plasma cells, and eosinophils infiltrate the meninges or around the cerebral vessels and form a granuloma around the dead parasites. Migration of worms leaves parasitic tracks with hemorrhage and microcavities. Hemosiderin, eosinophils, glial scars, and Charcot–Leyden crystals can be seen in the track. Living worms have been detected during necropsy in pulmonary vessels of patients from Taiwan, Australia, Jamaica, and Thailand[.2](#page-2-1)

#### **CLINICAL FEATURES**

Clinical manifestations are associated with worm migration and the inflammatory response to the worm. The incubation period of human angiostrongyliasis is usually 2 weeks or less, but may range from 1 day to several months, depending on the number of larva ingestion, worm location, and intensity of the host's inflammatory reaction.[3,4](#page-2-2) Disease is generally benign and selflimiting, with some patients only experiencing a mild headache that spontaneously subsides; however, occasionally there is severe illness with long-lasting neurologic sequelae. Some patients develop gastrointestinal symptoms after ingestion.

Patients usually present with symptoms and signs of acute meningitis over a few days. Headache is the most common early symptom and often the presenting complaint. Headache, as well as nausea and vomiting, is attributed to increased intracranial pressure or direct neuronal damage caused by dying larvae and host immune response.[5](#page-2-3) Headache is usually gradual and can be relieved by lumbar puncture. Neck stiffness is associated with severity of the disease. Patients with paresthesia may complain of numbness, itching, or a sensation of worms crawling under their skin[.6](#page-2-4) Fever is low grade and present in 32% of adult patients; 10% of them present with high fever (38°C–39°C)[.3](#page-2-2) In children, nausea, vomiting, fever, somnolence, and abdominal pain are common. Neurologic findings are present in 42% of cases, with slowly progressive impairment of sensation, which may last for a few months. Cranial nerve palsies (sixth and seventh) have been found in 17% to 30%[7,8](#page-2-5) [\(Fig. 122.2\)](#page-1-1). Clinical signs can fluctuate; the patient may have headache, confusion, severe generalized dysesthesia, neck stiffness, and various focal neurologic signs but later the same day they can be almost symptom free. The mortality rate in adults is low; however, death is common in children.

Rarely (1% of cases), infective larvae migrate to the eye, causing ocular angiostrongyliasis[.9](#page-2-6) Only 16% of these patients had visual impairment and 12% had an abnormal fundus[.6](#page-2-4) Ocular angiostrongyliasis is usually found in association with meningitis. The parasite has been seen in the anterior or posterior chamber without causing inflammation. Patients usually complain of seeing something

Cases in which the larval migration causes an inflammatory and granulomatous reaction in the retina, vitreous, and anterior or posterior chamber can present with loss of vision, eye pain, and redness. Signs of iritis, vitreous haziness, ophthalmitis, or retinal detachment can be detected. Diplopia and strabismus also occur[.9](#page-2-6) Visual impairment may not improve to normal visual acuity after recovery.

In appropriate epidemiologic settings, patients who present with symptoms and signs of meningitis should be evaluated for angiostrongyliasis. Laboratory criteria for eosinophilic meningitis include eosinophilic pleocytosis of cerebrospinal fluid (CSF): the appearance of CSF is usually clear or mildly turbid as "coconut juice" ([Fig. 122.3](#page-1-2)).

usually have a CSF pressure > 200 mm H2O, and the CSF usually contains between 500 and 2000 leukocytes/mm3 with more than 20% eosinophils. The CSF protein concentration is slightly raised, and glucose is normal or slightly reduced. A complete blood count demonstrates eosinophilia in the majority of cases.[6](#page-2-4)

Patients with focal neurodeficits or encephalitis should be evaluated with a computed tomography or magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) scan to exclude other conditions. MRI findings of *Angiostrongylus* meningitis can be normal or show meningeal enhancement without focal lesions. There are reports of abnormal micronodular enhanced lesions or linear enhancements in the pia mater. Small parasitic tracks may be detected by MRI. Brain edema can be seen in severe cases.

The detection of *A. cantonensis* larvae in CSF[10](#page-2-7) or the ocular chamber is the gold standard for diagnosis. When no parasite is detected, immunologic testing is very helpful. Enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay and Western blot testing are suggested to detect the presence of antibodies against *A. cantonensis.* Serum antibodies against the 31 kDa glycoprotein antigen of *A. cantonensis* by Western blot is a specific immunodiagnostic test, but it can cross-react with other parasites such as gnathostomiasis, toxocariasis, hydatidosis, and strongyloidiasis[.11](#page-2-8) Sensitivity is 55.6% and specificity is 99.4%.[12](#page-2-9)

#### **DIFFERENTIAL DIAGNOSIS**

Eosinophilic meningitis can be caused by other parasitic infections, such as gnathostomiasis, paragonimiasis, cysticercosis, schistosomiasis, toxocariasis, baylisascariasis, and trichinellosis [\(Table 122.1](#page-2-10)). In Thailand, gnathostomiasis is an important differential diagnosis and should be suspected if the patient has a previous history of migratory swellings, hemorrhagic or xanthochromic cerebrospinal fluid, and eosinophilic pleocytosis. Serologic diagnosis can be performed to differentiate these two infections.

### **TREATMENT**

drugs*.*

Mild cases of angiostrongyliasis are self-limiting with spontaneous resolution over a few weeks. However, severe cases can develop permanent neurologic sequelae if there is no prompt treatment and can progress to coma and death. The recommended treatment is supportive. Lumbar puncture is effective at relieving symptoms of headache and nausea caused by increased intracranial pressure.

There have been a few clinical trials of treatment; most have included eosinophilic meningitis but have not always documented *Angiostrongylus* infection. Steroids are proposed as adjunctive therapy in eosinophilic meningitis. They can relieve intracranial pressure and improve neurologic symptoms due to the inflammatory responses to migrating and dying worms. An animal study showed that apoptosis of infected mouse brain was reduced by dexamethasone treatment.[13](#page-2-11) The used of oral prednisolone 60 mg/day (divided into three doses) for 2 weeks significantly shortened the length of headache, reduced the frequency of analgesic use, and decreased the number of lumbar punctures compared with placebo in patients with eosinophilic meningitis[.14,15](#page-2-12) Patients with eosinophilic meningitis and treated with a 2-week course of corticosteroids and albendazole had a similar duration of headache compared with patients receiving prednisolone only[.16,17](#page-3-0) Patients treated with prednisolone and mebendazole for 2 weeks had a similar duration of headache compared with the previous studies[.18](#page-3-1) A small study comparing the efficacy of albendazole and placebo demonstrated a decreased duration of headache in the albendazole-treated group.[19](#page-3-2) Surgery is required to remove worms from the eyes in ocular angiostrongyliasis[.20](#page-3-3)
