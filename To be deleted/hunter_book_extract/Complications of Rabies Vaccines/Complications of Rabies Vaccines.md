#### Complications of Rabies Vaccines

Tissue culture vaccines cause mild local reactions or transient, influenza-like symptoms in a small minority of vaccinees. Intradermal injections may cause transient irritation. Pre-exposure booster injections have caused a mild allergic urticarial rash, angioedema, and arthralgia within 2 weeks, which responds to symptomatic treatment. Some rare neurological symptoms following tissue culture vaccination have been attributed to the vaccine, but none have been fatal.

# **CONTROL OF ANIMAL RABIES**

Rabies can be controlled effectively in stray dogs by campaigns of mass vaccination, contraception, and reducing available food and shelter. Control of wildlife rabies has been achieved by oral, live-attenuated, or vaccinia recombinant rabies vaccines in baits. Fox rabies has been eliminated from Western Europe, and recombinant vaccines have produced promising results in foxes, raccoons, and coyotes in the United States. Oral vaccines for a variety of other species in America (e.g., skunks) and Africa (e.g., black-backed jackals) are being developed. Oral vaccines for stray dogs have not been practicable to date. Control of rabies in animal reservoirs has led to fewer cases of human rabies; for example, in Sri Lanka mass vaccination of dogs since the 1980s has led to a greatly reduced incidence of human disease.

#### **INTRODUCTION**

Enteroviruses are among the most common of human infections and are estimated to infect 50 million people annually in the United States and 1 billion annually worldwide. Although the majority (~90%) of infections are asymptomatic, enteroviruses are associated with a wide spectrum of disease manifestations, including fever and rash, acute hemorrhagic conjunctivitis, upper respiratory tract infection, myocarditis and pericarditis, pleurodynia, aseptic meningitis, encephalitis, poliomyelitis, severe neonatal infection, and chronic infection in immunocompromised patients. The majority of acute enterovirus infections (>80%) occur in children below 15 years of age, due, in part, to a lack of immunologic experience and cross-protective immunity to enterovirus infection, and to childhood behaviors that promote fecal–oral and personto-person transmission of infection.

Human enteroviruses are small, positive-sense RNA viruses that belong to the family Picornaviridae and have traditionally been grouped into the echoviruses, coxsackie A and B viruses, and polioviruses based on their growth properties in cell culture and in infant mice. As this system of classification is somewhat arbitrary, since the mid-1960s newly identified enteroviruses have simply been assigned a numerical designation, the first example being "enterovirus D68." The number of individual enterovirus strains now recognized is greater than 120. Recent molecular analysis of the enterovirus genome has led to the adoption of a new taxonomy in which enteroviruses are divided into four species: human enterovirus A, B, C, and D.[1](#page--1-0)

In this chapter, the epidemiology, pathophysiology, clinical presentation, differential diagnosis, and management of enterovirus infections that cause neurologic diseases, in particular polioviruses and enterovirus A71, are presented. Enteroviruses that predominantly cause mucocutaneous disease only are discussed in Chapter 32.3.

#### **EPIDEMIOLOGY**

Enterovirus infections occur in all human populations. Enterovirus infections occur throughout the year but are more highly prevalent in summer and autumn in temperate regions. More than 80% of enterovirus infections occur in children younger than 15 years of age, and attack rates are highest in infants under the age of 1 year old. The prevalence of enterovirus infections is greater in situations of poverty, overcrowding, and poor personal hygiene.

The frequency with which individual enterovirus serotypes cause infection varies markedly. Some enterovirus serotypes are continuously isolated from year-to-year, whereas others may temporarily emerge after years of relative inactivity. Individual enterovirus serotypes tend to circulate for a variable period before they are replaced by new serotypes. Typically, 5 to 10 serotypes are responsible for >85% of enterovirus infection at any one time, with considerable differences in serotype distribution between geographic locations. Occasionally, global epidemics may occur, such as hemorrhagic conjunctivitis pandemics caused by enterovirus D70 or coxsackievirus A24 and the 2015–2016 global epidemic of acute respiratory disease caused by enterovirus D68.[2](#page--1-1)

Virtually all enterovirus serotypes have been associated with aseptic meningitis. In the pre-polio vaccine era, polioviruses were the most common cause of aseptic meningitis. In the post-polio vaccine era, non-polio enteroviruses, in particular, echovirus types 4, 6, 9, 11, 13, 16, and 30; coxsackievirus B2, B3, B4 and B5; coxsackievirus A9; and enterovirus A71 have been the most frequently identified pathogens.

Poliomyelitis is thought to have been associated with humanity since antiquity ([Fig. 38.2.1](#page-1-0)). The first clinical descriptions of poliomyelitis date from the early 19th century, and its transmissibility was established in the late 19th century. In the pre-industrial era, poliovirus infection occurred most commonly in infants and young children in situations of poverty and overcrowding and was associated with endemic circulation and a low prevalence of paralytic poliomyelitis. Improvements in hygiene and standards of living in North America and Western Europe in the late 19th century resulted in exposure to poliovirus later in life, which was associated with an increased incidence of paralytic poliomyelitis and with the onset of the large urban poliomyelitis epidemics that occurred in industrialized countries in the first half of the 20th

century. Enterovirus A71 was first isolated from a child with encephalitis in California in 1970. From 1970 until 1997, enterovirus A71 was found to be the cause of occasional outbreaks of the childhood vesicular exanthem, hand-foot-and-mouth disease, and/or the enanthem herpangina associated with acute neurologic disease, including aseptic meningitis, poliomyelitis-like paralysis, and brainstem encephalitis. Since 1997, large outbreaks of enterovirus A71 infection have occurred in the Asia-Pacific region in association with the generation of new, and genetically distinct, virus genotypes.[3,4](#page--1-2)

# **NATURAL HISTORY, PATHOGENESIS, AND PATHOLOGY**

Transmission of enterovirus infection is by the fecal–oral route as a result of person-to-person contact or indirectly via fomites. The incubation period for most enterovirus infections has not been accurately determined. In the case of poliovirus, the incubation period is typically 3 to 5 days but may occasionally extend up to 2 weeks. Virus is shed in the respiratory secretions for 1 week and in the feces for 2 to 4 weeks or longer. People are most infectious during the incubation period and for the first 2 to 3 days after the onset of symptoms. It is considered that 80% to 95% of enterovirus infections are completely asymptomatic and that people who develop asymptomatic infection are the primary reservoir of enterovirus infection within the community.

**Fig. 38.2.1** The earliest evidence of human poliomyelitis-like disease can be found in an Egyptian stele dating from 1350 BC, which depicts a young man with typical asymmetric flaccid paralysis and atrophy of the lower limb. Poliomyelitis is characterized by fever, malaise, headache, nausea, vomiting, muscle pain, and stiffness of the neck and back followed by flaccid paralysis 1 to 3 days later.

<span id="page-1-0"></span>Enteroviruses are the responsible pathogen in more than 90% of cases of aseptic meningitis. Poliovirus types 1, 2, and 3 are the causative agents of acute poliomyelitis; poliovirus type 1 is most frequently associated with poliomyelitis, followed by type 3 and type 2. Enteroviruses D70, A71, and several coxsackievirus A strains are also associated with acute flaccid paralysis mimicking poliomyelitis, and numerous case reports have linked other enteroviruses with this syndrome.

Most of what is understood about the pathogenesis of enterovirus infection has resulted from research on poliovirus, and it is widely accepted that the early pathophysiologic events in non-polio enterovirus infections are similar. After ingestion, poliovirus first multiplies in the tonsils and Peyer's patches of the small intestine before spreading to regional lymph nodes and thence to the bloodstream as a "minor" viremia, which is transient and usually undetectable. During this phase, virus spreads to cells of the reticulo-endothelial system. In asymptomatic infection, viral replication is terminated by host defense mechanisms at this point in the infection cycle. In a small proportion of cases, infection develops within the reticulo-endothelial system, leading to a sustained ("major") viremia, which coincides with the onset of symptoms. The major viremia results in the dissemination of virus to target organs, such as the central nervous system (CNS) or the skin. Infection at these sites induces host inflammatory responses and tissue necrosis; the severity of inflammation and necrosis generally corresponds to the titer of infectious virus present in the affected tissue.

The mechanism of enterovirus invasion from the bloodstream into the CNS is unknown but may either involve virus traversing

the blood–brain barrier during the major viremia (the most likely mechanism in the pathogenesis of aseptic meningitis) or by retrograde axonal transport (which has been suggested for enterovirus A7[15](#page--1-3) ). The primary targets of poliovirus infection in the CNS are anterior horn motor neurons of the spinal cord ([Fig. 38.2.2](#page-2-0)). Enterovirus A71 infects the CNS more widely than poliovirus, including the hypothalamus, brainstem, and cerebellar dentate nucleus in addition to spinal cord anterior horn motor neurons.

# **CLINICAL FEATURES**

### **Aseptic Meningitis**

Aseptic meningitis is a syndrome characterized by clinical signs and symptoms of meningitis with negative bacterial cultures obtained from cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) specimens. Aseptic meningitis occurs most commonly in children but is also frequently reported in adults. The illness commences with fever and headache followed by signs of meningismus (neck stiffness, positive Kernig's sign), which may range from mild to severe. The illness is occasionally biphasic, with a brief prodromal febrile illness and recovery followed by a recurrence of fever accompanied by meningismus.

### **Poliomyelitis**

Infection with poliovirus may have one of several outcomes: (1) inapparent infection, which accounts for 90% to 94% of all infections; (2) abortive or minor illness, which occurs in 4% to 8% of cases and is associated with symptoms of upper respiratory tract infection, gastrointestinal upset or influenzalike illness; (3) non-paralytic poliomyelitis (1%–2%), with clinical features similar to aseptic meningitis (see earlier) and from which patients usually recover fully within a few days; and (4) paralytic poliomyelitis (0.1%–2%), characterized by flaccid paralysis, which is usually asymmetric and with the lower limbs more frequently involved than the upper limbs [\(Fig. 38.2.3A](#page-2-1)). Cases of paralytic poliomyelitis may recover completely or be left with permanent paralysis and muscular atrophy. It may be fatal, especially when the brainstem is involved (bulbar poliomyelitis) ([Fig. 38.2.3B\)](#page-2-1).

**Fig. 38.2.2** Location of motor neurons in the anterior horns of the spinal cord. After gaining entry into the CNS, poliovirus causes lytic infection of anterior horn motor neurons of the spinal cord, resulting in flaccid paralysis. Within the brain, the reticular formation, vestibular nuclei, cerebellar vermis, and deep cerebellar nuclei are most often infected by poliovirus (bulbar poliomyelitis).

### **Enterovirus A71 Infection of the Central Nervous System**

Enterovirus A71 and coxsackievirus A16 are the most common causes of hand-foot-and-mouth disease and herpangina. In contrast to coxsackievirus A16, enterovirus A71 infection can be complicated by acute neurologic disease, including aseptic meningitis, poliomyelitis-like paralysis, and brainstem encephalitis. Brainstem encephalitis caused by enterovirus A71 infection occurs mostly in children under 4 years of age and is associated with a high mortality as a result of a rapid-onset neurogenic pulmonary edema and cardiovascular collapse.

# **Hand-Foot-and-Mouth Disease**

Hand-foot-and-mouth disease occurs most often in children under 10 years of age. The illness commences with fever (>38.5°C) and sore throat. The fever lasts 1 to 2 days during which time vesicles appear on the anterior buccal and gingival mucous membranes and tongue. Cutaneous vesicles occur most frequently on palms of the hands and soles of the feet, but may also occur on the buttocks and extensor surfaces of the elbows and knees. The skin lesions of hand-foot-and-mouth disease are typically tender vesicles with a surrounding zone of erythema ([Fig. 38.2.4](#page-3-0)).

#### **Herpangina**

Herpangina often occurs in outbreaks involving young children. Herpangina is a vesicular enanthem of the soft palate and fauces accompanied by fever, sore throat, and painful swallowing. The illness often commences abruptly, with fever and myalgia preceding the enanthem by 24 hours. The lesions develop into 2- to 4-mm papules that vesiculate and ulcerate. The fever subsides in 2 to 4 days, and the ulcers heal over 6 to 7 days. Herpangina is generally a mild illness and requires only symptomatic treatment.

### **PATIENT EVALUATION, DIAGNOSIS, AND DIFFERENTIAL DIAGNOSIS**

The vesicles of hand-foot-and-mouth disease can be distinguished from herpetic vesicular rashes (caused by herpes viruses) by the highly characteristic distribution of the vesicles and because the number of lesions is generally fewer than that seen in varicella (which typically spares the palms and soles). Primary herpetic gingivostomatitis is characterized by the presence of vesicular lesions within the anterior oral cavity in patients who are generally more unwell and have higher fever and regional lymphadenopathy than children with hand-foot-and-mouth disease.

It is important to distinguish herpangina from bacterial tonsillitis and other viral causes of pharyngitis. The vesicles associated with herpangina are generally located in the posterior pharynx, in contrast to other vesicular enanthems, such as herpes simplex gingivostomatitis and hand-foot-and-mouth disease, which typically occur in the anterior oral cavity, and to aphthous ulceration, which appears as large ulcers on the lips, tongue, and buccal mucosa. Herpangina can generally be diagnosed confidently on clinical criteria alone.

It is of critical importance to distinguish bacterial meningitis from aseptic meningitis, which can be achieved by lumbar puncture and CSF microscopic examination and culture. However, it should be noted that partially treated bacterial meningitis may mimic aseptic meningitis in terms of the CSF profile. Aseptic meningitis caused by enteroviruses also requires differentiation from other infectious and non-infectious causes of this syndrome.[6](#page--1-4)

CSF examination is critically important in the diagnosis of meningitis. In aseptic meningitis, the CSF usually appears clear and has a low to moderate leukocyte count (10–500/mL) that only occasionally exceeds 1000/mL; the cell count is typically pleomorphic with a predominance of lymphocytes. However, CSF examination within the first 24 hours of illness may demonstrate a predominance of neutrophils. In general, the CSF glucose is within normal range and the CSF protein may be normal or slightly elevated. Although enteroviruses can be isolated in the CSF by cell culture, this method is slow, expensive, and has a low (35%) sensitivity compared with newer molecular diagnostic methodologies (see later), which have now replaced cell culture in the diagnosis of aseptic meningitis. Most patients with aseptic meningitis are sufficiently unwell to require hospital admission.

Poliomyelitis caused by poliovirus infection needs to be distinguished from paralysis caused by other enteroviruses, such as echovirus 6 and 9; coxsackievirus A7, A9, and B2, B3, B4 and B5; enterovirus D70 and enterovirus A71; Guillain–Barré syndrome; transverse myelitis; disorders of fluid and electrolyte balance; vitamin B1 deficiency; and other causes, such as the neurologic complications of diphtheria and botulism.

### **Laboratory Diagnosis of Enterovirus Infections**

The most readily obtainable specimens for the identification of enteroviruses include feces and rectal and throat swabs. Although these specimens generally provide a high yield in the presence of enterovirus infection, they are usually remote from the site of disease and thus only provide indirect evidence of the causative organism. Vesicle fluid may be collected from patients presenting with hand-foot-and-mouth disease and is useful in providing a more specific diagnosis.

Although the identification of enteroviruses in CSF provides a specific diagnosis in aseptic meningitis, the sensitivity of detection is much lower than for other specimens (throat swab, feces). Paired acute and convalescent sera (at least 7 days apart) may be collected to test for the presence of enterovirus-specific antibodies.

The most widely available laboratory technique for the identification of enterovirus infections is the reverse transcriptase– polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) assay. Virus isolation in cell culture is still used for the identification of specific enterovirus serotypes using immunologic techniques (neutralization with serotype-specific antisera, immunofluorescence with serotypespecific monoclonal antibodies). However, RT-PCR assays have largely replaced cell culture as the primary means of enterovirus diagnosis and identification.[7](#page--1-5) An excellent overview of the diagnostic modalities used in the diagnosis of poliovirus and non-polio enterovirus infections is provided in the World Health Organization (WHO) Enterovirus Surveillance Guidelines[.8](#page--1-6)

RT-PCR assays that target variable regions of the genome, principally the *VP1* structural protein gene, are used to identify enterovirus genomic RNA in cell culture supernatants or directly from patient specimens. Moreover, nucleotide sequencing of the amplified RT-PCR product and searching of genetic databases, such as GenBank, allows the identification of individual infecting enterovirus strains.[8](#page--1-6)

A number of enterovirus type–specific RT-PCR assays, such as enterovirus A71– and coxsackievirus A6, 10, and 16–specific assays, have been developed for use in regions of the world where these viruses cause a high level of endemic infection. The main reason to seek a laboratory diagnosis in cases of herpangina or hand-foot-and-mouth disease is to distinguish enterovirus A71 from the other coxsackie A viruses, as the former is more frequently associated with acute neurologic sequelae (see earlier).

Although several assays for the serologic diagnosis of enterovirus infections are available, they are generally considered impractical because of the large number of virus strains and the extensive serologic cross-reactivity between them, but also because serologic diagnosis is generally retrospective and thus not useful in patient management. However, serologic assays are frequently used for sero-epidemiologic investigations.

#### **TREATMENT AND PREVENTION**

No specific treatment is available for hand-foot-and-mouth disease and herpangina, which are generally mild and self-limited infections and require only symptomatic treatment. As with all other enteroviruses, infection can be prevented by handwashing after contact with infected patients and by social distancing measures, such as closing nursery schools.

Empirical antibiotic therapy is often commenced early in aseptic meningitis and until bacterial meningitis has been positively excluded. The advent of rapid diagnostic assays for enteroviruses has proven beneficial in limiting the duration of empirical antibiotic therapy and hospital admission in many cases of aseptic meningitis. Full recovery generally occurs rapidly in young children, although older children and adults may experience a longer convalescence in which subtle disturbances in motor function, coordination, learning, and concentration may persist for weeks to months.

No specific antiviral treatment for poliovirus infection is available. Intensive care support is often needed for patients with bulbar poliomyelitis and/or respiratory failure. Physical therapy is used to assist with the regaining of limb function and to minimize deformities caused by contractures. Similarly, treatment for enterovirus A71 brainstem encephalitis is symptomatic and supportive, as specific antiviral therapy is not currently available.

The molecular characterization of enteroviruses has led to the development of novel compounds that inhibit all of the major stages of viral replication.[9](#page--1-7) However, very few have been found to be sufficiently selective to be useful as drug candidates. Several "WIN" compounds, which specifically bind to the enterovirus capsid and inhibit viral uncoating, have been investigated[.10](#page--1-8) One compound, pleconaril,[11](#page--1-9) has been found to inhibit more than 90% of circulating enteroviruses, to be non-toxic in humans, and to provide significant therapeutic benefit in aseptic meningitis[6](#page--1-4) and chronic meningoencephalitis.[12](#page--1-10) Compassionate use of pleconaril in cases of severe neonatal enterovirus infection has also demonstrated the promise of significant therapeutic benefit.[11](#page--1-9) Unfortunately, pleconaril has been found to have limited activity against enterovirus A71[.11](#page--1-9) Rupintrivir, an inhibitor of enteroviral 3C protease activity, has been shown to inhibit enterovirus A71 infection in vivo.[12](#page--1-10) Moreover, several flavonoid compounds, including luteoloside, have also been shown to inhibit 3C protease activity and to inhibit enterovirus A71 infection in vitro[.13](#page--1-11) Many experimental antiviral agents relevant to enterovirus A71 infection are in various stages of development.[9](#page--1-7)

Poliovirus vaccines against all three serotypes are available as either a formalin-inactivated poliovirus vaccine (IPV) or as a live-attenuated, oral poliovirus vaccine (OPV). IPV is injected intramuscularly and provides individual protection by inducing circulating antibody that blocks the spread of virus to the CNS. OPV was first licensed in 1962. The advantages of OPV are that it induces both humoral (IgM, IgG) and mucosal (IgA) immunity and is able to interrupt wild poliovirus circulation. OPV is also less costly than IPV and does not require injection by trained vaccinators. Consequently, OPV is more suitable for mass immunization campaigns. However, OPV has several disadvantages: (1) the vaccine requires the maintenance of a cold chain; (2) interference between OPV and other enteric viruses can lead to vaccine failure; (3) OPV is contraindicated in persons with congenital or acquired immunodeficiency; and (4) OPV may revert to virulence and cause paralytic poliomyelitis in vaccine recipients or their contacts (vaccine-associated poliomyelitis) at a rate of approximately 1 case in every 2.5 million doses administered. Despite these disadvantages, mass immunization with OPV has formed the basis of the WHOcoordinated Global Poliomyelitis Eradication Program, which had resulted in the eradication of poliomyelitis in all but two countries (Pakistan and Afghanistan) by 2015. Unfortunately, progress toward eradication is being delayed by the emergence of circulating vaccine-derived polioviruses capable of causing outbreaks of paralytic poliomyelitis within populations with low OPV immunization levels[.14](#page--1-12) Nevertheless, the Global Poliomyelitis Eradication Program is moving steadily toward the eradication of poliovirus and is regarded as a major achievement in global health.

Recently the development and efficacy testing of three formalininactivated whole-virus vaccines against enterovirus A71 has been reported (reviewed in Ref. [15\)](#page--1-13). All three vaccines have been shown to be safe and effective in protecting against hand-foot-and-mouth
