### Onchocerciasis

Thomas B. Nutman

#### **KEY FEATURES**

- Onchocerciasis ("river blindness") is caused by the filarial nematode *Onchocerca volvulus*.
- The parasite is transmitted by Simulium black flies.
- Infection with *O. volvulus* can cause visual impairment and blindness, including anterior segment disease, with sclerosing keratitis and iridocyclitis, and posterior segment disease, with optic atrophy and chorioretinopathy.
- Infection with O. volvulus can cause debilitating skin disease, primarily a generalized papular dermatitis and rarely hyperreactive localized onchodermatitis ("sowda").
- Ivermectin is the treatment of choice for onchocerciasis, but doxycycline, an antibiotic that targets the *Wolbachia* endosymbiont, is an effective treatment strategy for the individual patient.
- Control of onchocerciasis consists of semi-annual or annual ivermectin treatment of at-risk populations.

#### INTRODUCTION

Onchocerciasis was first described in 1875 by John O'Neill, a British naval surgeon, among inhabitants of the West African coast suffering from a pruritic skin disease known as "craw-craw." Onchocerciasis remains a leading cause of debilitating skin and ocular disease in endemic regions in Africa and the Arabian Peninsula. Forty percent of disability-adjusted life years attributed to the disease are due to visual impairment and 60% to the severe itching with skin disease. Infection has been associated with increased mortality independent of its effects on sight and poses a major hurdle to economic well-being in highly endemic areas of Africa. However, control programs using repeated community treatments with ivermectin can interrupt transmission and lead to elimination of the infection in endemic regions.

#### **EPIDEMIOLOGY**

O. volvulus infects an estimated 37 million people, with ≈500,000 suffering visual loss, of which about one-half are blind. <sup>2,3</sup> An estimated 85.6 million people are thought to be at risk of infection. <sup>3</sup> Onchocerciasis is most prevalent in sub-Saharan Africa (Fig. 116.1) and is a major public health problem along rivers where the black fly vectors breed. The disease is currently endemic in 31 countries in Africa that account for more than 95% of the geographic distribution of O. volvulus. <sup>2</sup> Limited transmission exists in Yernen, Venezuela, and Brazil after successful elimination campaigns in previously endemic Latin American countries, including Colombia, Ecuador, Mexico, and Guatemala. <sup>2,3</sup>

Onchocerciasis foci have been classified epidemiologically into hyperendemic, mesoendemic, and hypoendemic, according to infection prevalences: >60%, 30% to 60%, and <30%, respectively. In highly endemic areas, *O. volvulus* infection is acquired early in life, and more than 90% of inhabitants may be infected by the age of 20 years. In communities with a low prevalence of infection, there is often little evidence of clinical disease.

With the rise in global migration and travel to remote destinations, onchocerciasis is increasingly diagnosed in non-endemic areas in immigrants, refugees, and travelers. As Onchocerciasis accounts for approximately 1 in 500 medical conditions diagnosed in returned travelers, and the risk of infection is higher among travelers to rural areas of Africa where the parasite is endemic.

## NATURAL HISTORY, PATHOGENESIS, AND PATHOLOGY

Infectious O. volvulus L3 larvae are transmitted by black flies and develop into adults that are found in subcutaneous fibrous nodules or onchocercomata (Fig. 116.2). Male adults migrate between nodules, where they fertilize sedentary females. Females release thousands of larvae or microfilariae into the surrounding tissues, where they can be ingested by feeding black flies to complete the life cycle (Fig. 116.3). The period from an infective bite to the detection of microfilariae in skin is generally between 10 and 20 months. Individuals infected with *O. volvulus* suffer disease largely affecting the skin, lymph nodes, and eyes. Pathology in these tissues is caused by inflammatory reactions that follow the death of microfilariae and that can be caused by the secretion of toxic products by granulocytes, by the deposition of immune complexes in the tissues, or by inflammatory mechanisms induced by release of Wolbachia-derived products (Wolbachia is an intracellular endosymbiont). Most clinical manifestations associated with O. volvulus are related to the chronic effects of repeated episodes of inflammation. Clinical disease can also follow short periods of exposure, such as among visitors to or expatriates living in endemic areas.

Skin disease is caused by inflammation around skin-dwelling microfilariae. Loss of skin elasticity and early aging characterize chronic, long-standing onchocerciasis. Microfilariae are seen histologically at the dermo-epidermal junction, and "live" intact microfilariae are generally observed free of inflammatory cells. The inflammatory changes take place in the upper dermis and include edema and fibrosis. Acute papules show intraepidermal microabscess formation with dead or degenerating microfilariae surrounded by eosinophils and neutrophils. There can be loss of melanin from basal cells, loss of elastic fibers, and atrophy of the dermis. Dermatitis occurs where microfilariae predominate, particularly around the buttocks and pelvic girdle where the inguinal and femoral nodes show evidence of lymphadenitis and fibrosis. Localized onchodermatitis (also known as "sowda") is characterized by enlarged, soft, regional lymph nodes associated with localized skin changes that histologically show a hyperreactive inflammatory cell infiltrate with sclerosis and edema but few microfilariae. Scarring in lymph nodes may lead to regional lymphedema, "hanging groin," or elephantiasis.

Individuals with greater-intensity infections (high microfilarial densities) are more likely to develop severe ocular disease. Ocular lesions are caused by invasion and local death of microfilariae. Microfilariae can enter the eye through the bulbar conjunctiva, along the sheaths of the scleral vessels and nerves, or by embolization in the choroidal or ciliary capillaries. Punctate keratitis is observed in the corneal stroma and clears without scarring. Punctate opacities are focal accumulations of lymphocytes and eosinophils around degenerating microfilariae with local edema. Sclerosing keratitis is a progressive fibrovascular pannus and inflammatory infiltrate composed mainly of lymphocytes and eosinophils that

starts at the level of Bowman's membrane. Mild, chronic uveitis is common with heavy microfilarial invasion of the anterior chamber. Lesions of the posterior chamber include optic atrophy and chorioretinopathy. The extent of chorioretinal changes is highly variable, and the retinal pigment epithelium (RPE) can show migration, clumping, atrophy, or focal hyperplasia. Chronic nongranulomatous chorioretinitis consists of an infiltrate of lymphocytes, plasma cells, and eosinophils with secondary degenerative changes in the overlying RPE and neuroretina. Loss of the photoreceptors and outer layers of the retina can be due to inflammatory damage to the RPE and choriocapillaris. This is followed by consecutive loss of the inner neuroretina, ganglion cells, and nerve fibers. Profound chorioretinal atrophy can develop with loss of almost all the retina and choroid. Optic atrophy is common in the more advanced stages of ocular onchocerciasis.

#### **CLINICAL FEATURES**

#### **Skin Disease**

The earliest and most troublesome symptom of onchocercal skin involvement is itching[.6](#page-6-4) The skin changes have been classified as acute papular onchodermatitis (APOD), chronic papular onchodermatitis (CPOD), localized onchodermatitis, atrophy, and pigmentation changes[.6,7](#page-6-4) More than one type of skin disease can coexist. APOD consists of small pruritic papules ([Fig. 116.4A](#page-4-0)). Because of pruritus, there can be excoriations, secondary infection, and ulceration. CPOD consists of flat-topped papules that vary in size and height above the skin surface [\(Fig. 116.4B\)](#page-4-0). Some lesions can be macular. Itching can occur; individuals with CPOD can also have acute lesions. Localized onchodermatitis typically affects young adults and is characterized by pruritic, hyperpigmented, and hyperkeratotic plaques [\(Fig. 116.4C\)](#page-4-0). The distribution is asymmetric, involving one limb, and is associated with regional lymphadenopathy. In later stages, the skin can be grossly lichenified. Itching is intense in the acute stage; this condition can coexist with APOD or CPOD. Atrophy of the skin is relatively common in areas of high endemicity ([Fig. 116.5D](#page-5-0)). Atrophic skin adopts many of the characteristics of aging, such as loss of elasticity, and the skin appears excessively wrinkled. Hairs may be lost and sweating reduced. Onchocercal depigmentation, or "leopard skin," is associated with patches of complete pigment loss and generally affects the lower leg anteriorly [\(Fig. 116.4E\)](#page-4-0). A rare manifestation is "hanging groin" or "adenolymphocele" that is observed only in heavy and long-standing infections, and consists of a pouch of lymphedematous tissue in which hang atrophic inguinal or femoral nodes [\(Fig. 116.4F](#page-4-0)). Inflammatory damage to the lymph nodes and lymphatics may, over the long term, lead to elephantiasis of the limbs or genitalia.

#### **Nodules**

Onchocercomata are subcutaneous fibrous nodules containing adult worms found in the region of the iliac crest, the trochanter, the sacrum, the upper thorax, and the head.

#### **Lymph Nodes**

Lymph node changes are commonly seen where they drain areas of onchodermatitis. Usually the nodes are only slightly enlarged, firm, and non-tender. Acute regional lymphadenopathy can accompany acute papular eruptions and lymphedema, but lymph node pathology is usually clinically silent.

#### **Eye Disease**

Punctate keratitis (fluffy or snowflake opacities) consists of opacities of the superficial corneal stroma ([Fig. 116.5A](#page-5-0)). They can be seen by the naked eye or visualized using a slit lamp. Up to 100 or more opacities measuring 0.5 mm in diameter may be observed; these lesions heal without scarring. Punctate keratitis can be asymptomatic or accompanied by conjunctival injection, chemosis, limbitis, and epiphora. Long-standing and heavy infections can result in massive invasion of the cornea, leading to the development of sclerosing keratitis, a slowly progressive scarring of the cornea [\(Fig. 116.5B](#page-5-0)). Severe anterior uveitis (iridocyclitis)

<span id="page-2-0"></span>can occur with the development of posterior synechiae and pearshaped deformity of the pupil, a loss of the iris pigment frill, and a pumice-stone appearance of the iris[.8](#page-6-5) Extensive synechiae can cause seclusio- and occlusio-pupillae, secondary cataracts, and secondary glaucoma.[8,9](#page-6-5)

Chorioretinitis or chorioretinopathy is slowly progressive, taking many years before visual loss is evident. It is characterized by retinal pigment epithelial atrophy and chorioretinal scarring.[8,9](#page-6-5) Chorioretinopathy in onchocerciasis is first seen as a loss of pigment lateral to the macula [\(Fig. 116.5 C and D](#page-5-0)) or nasal to the optic disc at the level of RPE. Pigment loss appears as a gray-yellow mottling. RPE loss progresses in an arc around the macula and eventually may become confluent, producing areas of geographic atrophy [\(Fig. 116.5F](#page-5-0)). Extensive atrophy can be accompanied by choriocapillary atrophy (the choroidal vessels become exposed) and subretinal fibrosis. The macula is often preserved until late in the course of disease. Mild forms of RPE atrophy may be detected only by fluorescein angiography. Fundal changes are usually symmetric. Post-neuritic optic atrophy reflects previous episodes of active inflammation of the optic nerve[8,9](#page-6-5) ([Fig.](#page-5-0) [116.5E\)](#page-5-0). Onchocercal optic atrophy can follow extensive destruction

of the retina [\(Fig. 116.5F](#page-5-0)). Both forms are generally accompanied by inflammatory changes such as peripapillary hyperpigmentation and sheathing of the central retinal vessels.

#### **Other Complications**

Chronic infections are associated with low body weight and diffuse musculoskeletal pain. A form of dwarfism in the Mabira forest of Uganda, Nakalanga dwarfism, has been attributed to pituitary involvement[.10](#page-6-6) An association between onchocerciasis and epilepsy has been reported.[11–13](#page-6-7) A related epidemic form of epilepsy, termed *nodding syndrome,*[14,15](#page-6-8) has recently gained attention and may be related to *O. volvulus*–induced antibodies that cross-react with proteins expressed on the surface of neurons[.16,17](#page-6-9) Other conditions are reproductive abnormalities with secondary amenorrhea, spontaneous abortion, and infertility.

#### **PATIENT EVALUATION, DIAGNOSIS, AND DIFFERENTIAL DIAGNOSIS**

The chance of acquiring *O. volvulus* increases with greater exposure time in endemic regions ([Box 116.1\)](#page-2-1). Some patients may be diagnosed through investigation of eosinophilia. A presumptive diagnosis can be made based on a history of exposure in an endemic area, the presence of subcutaneous nodules, or typical skin and/or ocular signs. Early onchodermatitis is rarely diagnosed correctly and must be distinguished from atopic dermatitis, food allergies, contact dermatitis, insect bites, and scabies. Chronic skin lesions can be mistaken for severe chronic eczema, malnutrition, and presbydermia. "Leopard skin" must be distinguished from other causes of hypochromia, including vitiligo and leprosy.

Definitive diagnosis depends on the identification of microfilariae in skin snips or of the adult worms from excised or aspirated nodules.[18](#page-6-10) Skin snips can be obtained using a corneoscleral punch ([Fig. 116.6A\)](#page-6-11) or by elevating a crease of skin with the point of a needle ([Fig. 116.6B](#page-6-11)) and obtaining a small, circular slice of epidermis and superficial dermis using a scalpel blade. The skin snip is then incubated on a glass slide in saline and examined using a dissecting microscope (or magnifying glass) to detect emergent microfilariae[.18](#page-6-10)

Ocular microfilariae can be detected by slit lamp examination. The chance of detection is increased if patients are asked to sit with their head between their legs for up to 10 minutes before examination. Microfilariae in the anterior chamber are seen as small wriggling worms. Live microfilariae in the cornea are transparent and coiled.

Assays to detect antibodies specific to *O. volvulus*[19–21](#page-6-12) and polymerase chain reaction (PCR[\)22](#page-6-13) to detect onchocercal DNA in skin snips are highly sensitive and specific and are in use in specialized laboratories throughout the world. A rapid point-of-care serologic test for onchocerciasi[s23](#page-6-14) is commercially available (SD Bioline Onchocerciasis IgG4 Rapid Test). Although current serologic assays have limited ability to discriminate past exposure from current infection, the detection of *O. volvulus* DNA in microscopically negative skin snips is useful in individuals with light infections.

#### **TREATMENT**

Ivermectin is the most important drug for the treatment of onchocerciasis. It is well tolerated, highly efficacious, and rapidly reduces microfilarial numbers in the skin[.24](#page-6-15) The drug is administered as a single dose of 150 µg/kg. Because ivermectin has limited effects on adult worms, treatment must be repeated at annual or semi-annual intervals for the duration of the lives of adult worms to suppress dermal microfilarial levels. Ivermectin significantly reduces the itching of reactive onchocercal skin disease, but because microfilariae can re-invade the skin within 6 months of treatment, annual treatments may not be sufficient to control pruritus, and treatment every 3 months may be necessary for the first 1 to 2 years.

Contraindications for ivermectin treatment are conditions associated with an impaired blood–brain barrier because penetration into the central nervous system can cause lethargy, ataxia, tremors, and death. The drug is not approved for use in children weighing less than 15 kg (or <5 years) ([Box 116.2](#page-3-1)), pregnant women, and mothers nursing infants during the first week of life. Ivermectin has no significant drug interactions.

Ivermectin has a marked beneficial effect on anterior segment disease[.8,25](#page-6-5) A single dose of ivermectin is associated with a reduction in the prevalence of punctate corneal opacities and microfilariae in the anterior chamber. Repeated treatments result in an

improvement in the early lesions of iridocyclitis and sclerosing keratitis. There is evidence that ivermectin may also have a useful effect even in relatively advanced cases of iridocyclitis. The benefits of ivermectin on posterior segment disease are less clear, with the drug shown to be beneficial against the development of optic atrophy but not chorioretinal diseases.[8,25](#page-6-5) Control programs using ivermectin have had a major impact on the development of the lesions of ocular onchocerciasis and prevented visual loss and blindness.[26,27](#page-6-16)

A mild clinical reaction (Mazzotti-like reaction) occurs in 10% to 20% of patients receiving a first dose of ivermectin; a more severe reaction also can be seen. During subsequent treatments, the frequency and severity of adverse reactions are reduced. Reactions are characterized by worsening of rash in previously affected areas. Edema can affect one limb or the face and is

associated with enlarged, tender regional lymph nodes. A systemic reaction can be observed, characterized by fever, arthralgia, musculoskeletal pain, and severe postural hypotension. Patients with localized onchodermatitis tend to have more severe reactions after treatment. Mild reactions require only symptomatic treatment (e.g., antihistamines and anti-pyretics). Severe reactions may require corticosteroids.

Extreme caution should be exercised in those with a possible exposure history to loiasis, as the death of *Loa loa* microfilariae from ivermectin treatment can cause severe, or even fatal, encephalitis.[28,29](#page-6-17) The presence of heavy infections with *L. loa* (microfilarial densities >20,000/mL) is a contraindication to the use of ivermectin,[30](#page-6-18) and loiasis should be ruled out before ivermectin treatment.

Because a *Wolbachia* endosymbiotic bacteria is present in *O. volvulus* and is required for the survival of *Onchocerca,* doxycycline at a daily dose of 200 mg for 6 weeks inhibits *O. volvulus* fertility and kills approximately 50% of adult worms when given with a

This approach (doxycycline plus ivermectin) provides a macrofilaricidal treatment option for individuals who do not live in endemic areas and are thus unlikely to get re-infected.

#### **Control**

The initial objective of onchocerciasis control strategies was to reduce community microfilarial burdens to levels that were associated with negligible morbidity. Elimination of onchocerciasis is now the objective, bolstered by the certification of elimination in four countries in Latin America: Ecuador[,35](#page-6-20) Colombia,[36](#page-6-21) Guatemala[,37](#page-6-22) and Mexico[.38](#page-7-0) Elimination efforts in Africa rely on annual distribution of ivermectin, donated by its manufacturer, Merck & Co. Originally overseen by the African Program for Onchocerciasis Control (APOC), as of 2016, the onchocerciasis elimination efforts across Africa are under the auspices of the Expanded Special Project for Elimination of Neglected Tropical Diseases (ESPEN).[39](#page-7-1)

Concerns for sub-optimal microfilaricidal responses to ivermecti[n40](#page-7-2) or potential resistance[41](#page-7-3) have surfaced. Measures that can be adjunctive to annual ivermectin distribution are being sought.
