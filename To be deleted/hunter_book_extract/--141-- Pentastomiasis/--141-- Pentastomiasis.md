# **141** Pentastomiasis

*Dennis Tappe, David A. Warrell*

## KEY FEATURES

- • Pentastomiasis (synonyms: tongue worm infection, porocephalosis, linguatulosis, or linguatuliasis) is caused by the larval stages of maxillopod crustaceans known as *pentastomids* or *pentastomes*; the two genera most often responsible for human infection are *Linguatula* spp. and *Armillifer* spp.
- • *Linguatula* infection is acquired by contact with dog saliva or by eating raw ruminant offal, most often liver. In humans, larvae cause obstructive symptoms in various organs or acute nasopharyngeal pentastomiasis (Halzoun or Marrara syndrome). *Armillifer* infection is acquired by eating raw snake meat or drinking water contaminated by snake excretions. Unless infection involves the eye or is massive, human infection is asymptomatic but revealed by appearance of calcified larvae on abdominal radiographs or during surgery.
- • There is no proven chemotherapy, but ivermectin, praziquantel, or benzimidazoles could be tried in severe symptomatic cases; surgery may be needed to relieve obstructive symptoms.
- • Prevention is by avoiding eating raw meat, boiling drinking water, and proper hand hygiene after contact with dogs or snakes.

#### **INTRODUCTION**

Pentastomiasis, also termed *porocephalosis, linguatulosis, linguatuliasis,* or *tongue worm infection,* is a zoonosis caused by the 10- to 20-mmlong larval stages of pentastomids or pentastomes. Pentastomes are unusual vermiform parasites now considered a subclass of maxillopod crustaceans.[1,2](#page-2-0) The name "pentastome" ("five mouths") derives from the appearance of two pairs of hooks above the mouth of the parasites, and "tongue worm" refers to the resemblance of some pentastomes to an animal's tongue. Of the more than 100 species, 10% are zoonotic and belong to the families Linguatulidae, Porocephalalidae, Sebekidae, and Raillietiellidae*.* The vast majority of human infections are caused by only two genera, *Linguatula* and *Armillifer.* Adult parasites inhabit the respiratory tracts of their definitive vertebrate hosts—canids in the case of *Linguatula* spp. and snakes in the case of *Armillifer* spp. They attach to respiratory tract epithelium by their perioral hooks and suck up blood, tissue fluids, and secretions[.1,3,4](#page-2-0) Larval stages cause invasive disease in humans after ingestion of infective parasite ova. Visceral and ocular pentastomiasis is most often due to *Linguatula serrata, Armillifer armillatus,* and *Armillifer grandis,* whereas subcutaneous pentastomiasis is thought to be caused by *Raillietiella* and *Sebekia* spp[.1,5–7](#page-2-0) In contrast, nasopharyngeal pentastomiasis is caused by *L. serrata* after ingestion of raw offal containing parasite larvae[.3,5](#page-2-1)

#### **HUMAN INFECTION WITH** *LINGUATULA* **SPECIES**

*Linguatula serrata* occurs in Europe; the Middle East; Africa; and North, Central, and South America[,1](#page-2-0) where canids are the definitive hosts. In some parts of the Middle East, more than 50% of stray dogs are infected with *L. serrata.* These animals harbor adults in their upper respiratory tracts and shed ova in their nasal secretions, saliva, and feces onto vegetation or into water. Ova are ingested by herbivorous animals and by humans who become intermediate hosts after contact with dogs' nasal secretions or contaminated food. *Linguatula* larvae hatch in the gut lumen and encyst and moult in various host organs; visceral or ocular pentastomiasis develops[.1,3,5](#page-2-0) Humans can also be infected by ingesting infected offal from ruminants containing *Linguatula* larvae that migrate to the nasopharynx, in which case they develop nasopharyngeal pentastomiasis (Halzoun syndrome in Lebanon or Marrara syndrome in Sudan) and become temporary definitive hosts.

#### **CLINICAL FEATURES**

#### **Visceral and Ocular Pentastomiasis**

When humans ingest *Linguatula* ova, larvae hatch in the gut, burrow through its wall, migrate through the tissues, and encyst mainly in the liver. Later larval stages can obstruct or compress biliary, gastrointestinal, or respiratory tracts; meninges; brain; or the anterior chamber of the eye, causing iritis and secondary glaucoma.[1,7,8](#page-2-0)

#### **Nasopharyngeal Pentastomiasis**

This follows ingestion of raw liver or lymph nodes from sheep, goats, cattle, buffalo, camels, and lagomorphs containing encysted or migrating third-stage larvae. Larvae migrate from the stomach up the esophagus to the nasopharynx mucosa.[9,10](#page-2-2) Within minutes to a few hours of eating the infected viscera, there is intense irritation of the upper respiratory and gastrointestinal tracts causing coughing, sneezing, rhinorrhea, retching, vomiting, lacrimation, hemoptysis, epistaxis, cervical lymphadenopathy, transient deafness, difficulty in speaking, dysphagia, wheezing, dyspnea, edema of the face and oropharynx, and urticaria. These clinical features suggest a hypersensitivity reaction. Wriggling larvae are found in sputum and vomitus. Patients who survive the acute upper airway obstruction usually recover in 1 to 2 weeks. Persistent infections are rare.

#### **HUMAN INFECTION WITH** *ARMILLIFER* **SPECIES**

These markedly annulated, non-segmented parasites of up to 20 cm long inhabit the respiratory and digestive tracts of large snakes, such as pythons, vipers, and cobras [\(Fig. 141.1](#page-1-0)). Human infections are rare, but they are endemic in rural parts of West Africa (*A. armillatus*[1,2](#page-2-0)), Central Africa (*A. armillatus* and *A. grandis*[1,6](#page-2-0)), and Southeast Asia (*A. moniliformis*[1,11](#page-2-0) and *A. agkistrodontis*[12](#page-2-3)). Epidemiologic studies have shown prevalences of 1% to 4% by radiology in Africa, and 33% to 45% by autopsy in special ethnic groups in Africa and Malaysia.[6](#page-2-4) Infections in immigrants to Europe and North America have also been reported.[13](#page-2-5) Humans may ingest ova shed in the snake's nasal secretions by drinking water contaminated by snakes or by handling pet snakes (including pythons kept as revered peridomestic totems in West Africa) and then licking their fingers. Ova, larvae, and adult pentastomids may also be ingested accidentally by eating raw snake as part of diets, rituals, or for medicinal reasons. In humans, ingested eggs hatch in the gut, releasing larvae that burrow into the tissues where they encyst and moult, die, and eventually calcify[.1](#page-2-0)

#### **Visceral and Ocular Pentastomiasis**

Visceral infection is usually asymptomatic, but migration of larvae from the gut into the tissue, as well as encystation, may produce a variety of symptoms and signs after ingestion of many ova or adult female pentastomes. Fever, abdominal pain, diarrhea, hepatosplenomegaly, and obstructive jaundice prompting laparotomy (at which hundreds of larvae may be discovered beneath the visceral peritoneum) have been described.[1](#page-2-0) Hemorrhagic enterocolitis and intestinal obstruction, secondary bacterial septicemia, and pneumonia are reported in the rare fatal cases. The peritoneum, mesenterium, liver [\(Fig. 141.2](#page-1-1)), lungs, pleura, pericardium, and

#### **Human Infection With Rare Pentastome Species**

Subcutaneous creeping eruptions resembling cutaneous larva migrans have been assumed due to *Raillietiella hemidactyli* in Vietnam after ingestion of living lizard[s6](#page-2-4) and have been described for *Sebekia* spp. in Costa Rica[14](#page-2-6) (subcutaneous pentastomiasis). *Raillietiella* spp. has also been detected in a visceral infection in central Africa[,6](#page-2-4) and a species named *Porocephalus taiwana*, morphologically resembling *A. agkistrodontis,* caused visceral disease in China[.15](#page-2-7)

#### **DIAGNOSIS**

Severe visceral infections are associated with neutrophil leukocytosis, sometimes with eosinophilia and other features of an inflammatory response and anemia, but results of other routine investigations, including hepatic enzymes, are normal. Calcified crescent-shaped pentastome larvae may be discovered accidentally in the lungs or abdomen by radiology, producing a distinctive radiographic appearance [\(Fig. 141.4\)](#page-1-3).[1](#page-2-0) Unlike cysticerci, they are not found in muscle, but they must be distinguished from calcified mesenteric lymph nodes and calculi.[16](#page-2-8) They are usually numerous and most dense in the lower lung fields and abdomen (especially the right upper quadrant), reflecting their subperitoneal disposition. Ultrasound and imaging may detect hyperechoic/dense lesions in the peritoneum, liver, and other viscera, resembling tumors[.17](#page-2-9) At surgery or autopsy, encapsulated intact or decayed larvae may be found in the lungs, liver, mesenterium, intestinal wall, and other tissues.[1,18](#page-2-0) Their macroscopic and histologic appearances are well described[.1,6,7,14,18](#page-2-0) Pentastomids have also been identified by polymerase chain reaction in an increasing number of cases and in local clusters.[6–8](#page-2-4) Serologic tests are being developed but are not readily available yet.

#### **TREATMENT**

There is no proven effective chemotherapy for pentastomiasis. Ivermectin, praziquantel, and benzimidazoles have shown no effect in vitro[,19](#page-2-10) but have been used with apparent success in individual cases from Asia[.15](#page-2-7) Obstruction and compression should be relieved surgically. Hypersensitivity phenomena (Halzoun) should be treated with adrenaline (epinephrine), antihistamines, and corticosteroids.

### **PREVENTION**

Pentastomiasis can be prevented by thoroughly cooking all meat of any origin, but especially of the key host species, by boiling and/or filtering of drinking water, and by proper hand hygiene after handling and touching final hosts[.1](#page-2-0)
