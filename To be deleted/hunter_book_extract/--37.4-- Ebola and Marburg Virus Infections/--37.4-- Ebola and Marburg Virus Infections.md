# **37.4** Ebola and Marburg Virus Infections

*Daniel G. Bausch, Ian Crozier*

# KEY FEATURES

- • Ebolaviruses and Marburgviruses are among the most dangerous causes of viral hemorrhagic fever—an acute severe systemic illness that may rapidly evolve to severe multi-organ systemic disease, with a propensity for bleeding and shock.
- • The pathogenic filoviruses are endemic in sub-Saharan Africa, where bats are thought to be the natural reservoir.
- • Virus transmission occurs through direct and usually inadvertent exposure of mucous membranes or broken skin to infected excreta, blood, and other body fluids.
- • Microvascular instability and impaired hemostasis are the pathobiologic hallmarks, with death often resulting from an intense inflammatory process akin to septic shock.
- • The differential diagnosis is extremely broad, and the non-specific clinical manifestations of filovirus disease make diagnosis on clinical grounds difficult, especially early in the course of disease. Thus rapid laboratory confirmation is imperative.
- • Specialized infection prevention and control measures for viral hemorrhagic fevers are required when filovirus disease is suspected.
- • Although the treatment of filovirus disease remains supportive, a number of promising experimental therapies and vaccines are under investigation.
- • In survivors, viral persistence can occur in several "immunologically privileged" tissue compartments and associated fluids, rarely resulting in sexual transmission and recrudescent disease.

#### **INTRODUCTION**

Viral hemorrhagic fever classically refers to an acute severe systemic illness presenting with fever and non-specific initial signs and symptoms that rapidly evolves to severe multi-organ systemic disease, with a propensity for bleeding and shock. Although over 30 viruses from four taxonomic families have been linked with the syndrome, historically the most notorious are members of the *Ebolavirus* and *Marburgvirus* genera in the family *Filoviridae* ([Table](#page-0-2) [37.4.1](#page-0-2)), so-named for their unique filamentous shape (Latin *filo* = "thread"). Filoviruses are composed of a single negative-sense strand of RNA (19 KB) encapsulated in a lipid envelope. Seven filoviruses have been identified that infect humans but not all cause disease.[1–3](#page-10-0) As has been the custom, the viruses are named after the site of the first recognized cases, although this practice has now fallen out of favor. The present evidence base is generally insufficient to practically distinguish Ebola and Marburg virus disease syndromes. Thus here we generally discuss them together as "filovirus disease," pointing out differences where the evidence allows.

The relative ease of filovirus transmission between humans, high mortality, potential for major public health impact, including public panic and economic disruption seen so graphically during the 2013–2016 outbreak of Ebola virus disease in West Africa, require special action for public health preparedness.[4–6](#page-10-1) In addition to the danger posed in endemic areas, filoviruses are among the agents of highest concern with regard to potential use as bioweapons. Consequently, for reasons of both biosafety and biosecurity, research on filoviruses is highly regulated, with live virus manipulation restricted to high containment laboratories.[2,3](#page-10-2)

# **Maintenance in Nature and Transmission to Humans**

Bats are thought to be the filovirus's natural reservoir. Present evidence is stronger for Marburg virus, which has been isolated on numerous occasions from the Egyptian fruit bat (*Rousettus*

*aegyptiacus*), including from caves and mines associated with human cases of Marburg virus disease. In contrast, ebolaviruses have yet to be isolated from a bat, although viral RNA and anti-ebolavirus immunoglobulin G (IgG) have been detected in a number of bat species. Evidence of ebolavirus infection has been noted in other wild animals, especially non-human primates, such as monkeys, gorillas, and chimpanzees, presumably through exposure to bats, but these animals are thought to be dead-end hosts, developing severe disease similar to that seen in humans and playing no role in natural virus maintenance. Animals sick with filovirus infection may be easier prey for hunters. Reston virus, which does not appear to be pathogenic to humans, has been isolated from pigs in the Philippines, which were presumably infected from exposure to bats[.2,3](#page-10-2)

Both primary infection from animals and secondary infection between humans are thought to be through direct and usually inadvertent exposure of mucous membranes or broken skin to infected excreta, blood, and other body fluids. The infectious dose appears to be low, perhaps on the order of just a few virions. Infection through fomites cannot be excluded. There is no evidence of aerosol transmission between humans, although transmission and disease via artificial aerosol generation have been shown in non-human primates, with implications for potential use as bioweapons. Because filoviruses are relatively unstable in the environment and are rapidly inactivated by heating, consumption of cooked or smoked animal meat poses little risk. Rather, infection likely occurs during hunting and butchering.[2,3](#page-10-2)

## **Human-to-Human Transmission**

Human-to-human infection occurs most often in the context of providing care to a sick family member (community transmission) or patient (nosocomial transmission), as well as during funeral rituals that entail direct exposure to the corpse.[2,3](#page-10-2) Despite high infectivity, secondary attack rates for filoviruses are generally low, probably because transmission between humans requires direct contact with contaminated blood or body fluids. During the 2013–2016 West Africa Ebola virus disease outbreak, in households with an acutely infected person, the attack rate was less than 1% for persons not providing patient care, rising to 22.9% for those with direct patient contact and 47.9% for those providing direct care, and 83% for persons in direct contact with corpses[.5,7](#page-10-3) The outbreak served as a poignant illustration of how the risk of transmission can increase significantly when patient loads overwhelm fragile health systems and infection prevention and control measures break down, often pressing insufficiently trained and equipped health care workers into service. In some cases, highly infectious "super spreaders" have been suspected.[4,6](#page-10-1) Despite modern-day travel, imported cases of filoviral fever remain rare and usually do not result in secondary transmission due to the more routinely maintained infection prevention and control practices in resource-rich countries.[3](#page-10-4)

Infectivity parallels the clinical state, with risk of transmission low in the first few days of febrile symptoms but rising drastically as the disease progresses in severity and patients with high viral loads shed virus into the environment through vomiting, diarrhea, and when bleeding[.2,3](#page-10-2) The risk of transmission during the incubation period or from asymptomatic or recovered persons is negligible, with the exception of sexual transmission related to filovirus persistence in the semen of male survivors (see later).

Although a few apparently non-pathogenic filoviruses appear to circulate outside Africa, all the pathogenic viruses and all recognized outbreaks to date have originated in sub-Saharan Africa ([Fig. 37.4.1](#page-2-0)). Marburg virus was first isolated and named after an outbreak in West Germany and Yugoslavia in 1967 in workers harvesting tissues for vaccine production from monkeys imported from Uganda. Discovery of two Ebolaviruses followed in 1976, with outbreaks in Zaire (present-day Democratic Republic of the Congo) and Sudan. Periodic outbreaks continue to this day, with apparently increasing frequency [\(Table 37.4.2](#page-2-1)).[2,3](#page-10-2) Whether this reflects a true increase in events, perhaps due to climatic factors influencing the abundance or proportion of infected bats or other unknown spillover reservoirs, changing human behaviors resulting in increased exposure to infected animals, enhanced surveillance and detection, or a combination of all three factors remains unknown. Whereas once considered an "exotic disease" posing limited risk albeit with devastating consequences, only to small numbers of people in remote African villages, the 2013–2016 outbreak of Ebola virus disease in West Africa with a reported 28,616 cases and 11,310 deaths, including over 500 health workers, imported cases to the United States and Europe, and billions of dollars of economic loss, awoke the world to the potential for filovirus outbreaks to cause complex humanitarian crises and major global health threats.[4–6](#page-10-1)

# **NATURAL HISTORY, PATHOGENESIS, AND PATHOLOGY**

Microvascular instability and impaired hemostasis are the pathobiologic hallmarks of all viral hemorrhagic fevers, but much work remains to understand the precise pathogenetic mechanisms of disease and death. Severe disease is clearly associated with high levels of virus in blood and tissues, aided by filovirus-directed suppression of innate and adaptive immune responses. Most fatal cases die with high viral loads, having failed to mount a significant antibody response. By comparison, infectious virus is cleared rapidly from the blood in survivors.[2,3,8](#page-10-2)

After inoculation, the virus first replicates in dendritic cells and macrophages in local tissues. Whereas infected macrophages produce inflammatory cytokines, infected dendritic cells are dysfunctional in their ability to present viral antigens and costimulate T cells. Infected cells migrate to regional lymph nodes, and the virus is then disseminated through the lymph and blood monocytes to a broad range of tissues and organs, including the liver, spleen, lymph nodes, adrenal glands, lungs, and endothelium. Migration of tissue macrophages results in secondary infection of permissive parenchymal cells.[2,3,8](#page-10-2)

The interaction of virus with immune cells, especially macrophages and endothelial cells, results directly or indirectly (through soluble mediators) in cell activation and the unleashing of an inflammatory and vasoactive process in a "cytokine storm" consistent with the systemic inflammatory response syndrome. The synthesis of cell surface tissue factor triggers the extrinsic coagulation pathway. Impaired hemostasis may entail endothelial cell, platelet, or coagulation factor dysfunction. Macrophages over-express tissue factor, which is thought to contribute to vascular impairment and the frequently noted disseminated intravascular coagulation. Inflammatory cell infiltrates, which are usually mild, consist of a mix of mononuclear cells and neutrophils. In ebolavirus infection, replication and dissemination are facilitated by virus-induced suppression of the host adaptive immune response.[2,3,8](#page-10-2)

Tissue damage may be mediated through necrosis of infected cells or indirectly through apoptosis of immune cells, as seen in other forms of septic shock, and by immunopathology associated with dysregulated cellular immune responses. Precise mechanisms of death from filovirus disease are not well understood but are thought to stem from multi-organ system dysfunction due to ineffective circulatory volume due to capillary instability, compounded by volume loss from vomiting, diarrhea, and, less frequently, bleeding. Death from involvement and dysfunction of specific organs, including the liver, spleen, brain, kidney, thymus, and adrenal gland, may occur in some cases. Hepatocellular necrosis is often widespread and thought to play a major role. Inclusion bodies are often visible in intact cells.[2,3,8,9](#page-10-2)

<span id="page-4-1"></span><sup>\*\*</sup>This outbreak is ongoing at the time of this writing, with over 625 cases, making it the second largest Ebola virus outbreak on record.

#### **CLINICAL FEATURES**

Filovirus disease is seen in both sexes and over all age groups, with a spectrum from relatively mild or even asymptomatic infection to severe vascular permeability resulting in shock, multi-organ system failure, and death. After a typical incubation period of about 7 days (range 2–21), patients typically present with nonspecific signs and symptoms difficult to distinguish from a host of other febrile illnesses. These include fever, general malaise, anorexia, headache, chest or retrosternal pain, sore throat, myalgia, arthralgia, and lumbosacral pain. Conjunctival injection or hemorrhage may be present but is not accompanied by itching, discharge, or rhinitis, which should suggest another diagnosis [\(Fig. 37.4.2](#page-4-2)). Other forms of hemorrhage are almost never present in the first few days of illness. Hiccups are occasionally noted and may be a more specific but poorly sensitive indicator of filovirus disease. Although seen in less than 10% of patients, a morbilliform or maculopapular facial or truncal rash, often fleeting, may be an early and relatively specific indicator of filovirus disease. A dry cough, sometimes accompanied by a few scattered rales on auscultation, is common, but prominent pulmonary symptoms are uncommon early in the course of the disease. Jaundice is not typical except in patients with underlying Gilbert syndrome, drug reactions, or coinfection[.2,3,10](#page-10-2)

After the first few days, gastrointestinal signs and symptoms readily ensue, including nausea, vomiting, epigastric and abdominal pain, abdominal tenderness, and non-bloody diarrhea or constipation. Gastrointestinal fluid losses may lead to severe volume depletion and electrolyte abnormalities; in the West Africa Ebola virus disease outbreak, patients often required up to 5 liters of oral or intravenous fluid replacement daily. A misdiagnosis of appendicitis or other acute abdominal emergency sometimes prompts potentially hazardous surgical interventions.[2,3,10](#page-10-2)

In severe cases, patients progress after 7 to 10 days of illness to vascular instability, which may be manifested by conjunctival injection and hemorrhage, facial flushing, edema, bleeding, hypotension, shock, and proteinuria. Hemorrhage may be manifested as hematemesis, melena, hematochezia, metrorrhagia, petechiae, purpura, epistaxis, and bleeding from the gums and venipuncture sites (see [Fig. 37.4.2\)](#page-4-2). Hemoptysis and hematuria are infrequent. Acute renal insufficiency or failure is common. Central nervous system manifestations, including delirium, tremor, gait anomalies, convulsions, and hiccups, may be noted in the second to third week of illness and in end-stage disease. Cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) examination is uncommonly performed in these settings; however, ebolavirus RNA has been detected in the CSF of acutely ill patients with meningoencephalitis syndromes[.2,3,10](#page-10-2)

Although most pregnant women infected with filoviruses present with severe disease, including spontaneous abortion and vaginal bleeding, atypical presentations were occasionally noted during the West Africa Ebola virus outbreak. These included mild and even afebrile presentations that may nevertheless progress to severe and fatal disease. It is hypothesized that in these cases the immune tolerance of pregnancy dampens the initial inflammatory clinical manifestations. How frequently this occurs is unknown, although anecdotal reports exist of similar atypical presentations, with obvious challenging implications for case identification and implementation of proper infection prevention and control, especially when emergency invasive obstetric procedures are indicated during an outbreak[.3,11](#page-10-4)

# **PATIENT EVALUATION, DIAGNOSIS, AND DIFFERENTIAL DIAGNOSIS**

The nonspecific early presentation of filovirus disease makes clinical diagnosis extremely difficult, especially outside the setting of a recognized outbreak, which is usually detected when clusters of cases occur, especially when they involve health care workers. A complete epidemiologic history (including details of travel, possible exposures, and occupational risks), details of disease evolution, physical examination, and preliminary basic laboratory results are critical[.2,3,8](#page-10-2) The diagnosis of filoviral fever should be considered in patients with a clinically compatible syndrome who within the last 21 days:

- • Reside in or traveled to an endemic area, especially if an outbreak is ongoing
- • Had potential direct contact with blood or body fluids of someone who was ill with acute filovirus disease, including health care workers, persons caring for family members at home or preparing bodies for burial, and laboratory personnel
- • Had contact with live orrecently killed wild animals (especially non-human primates) in or recently arriving from an area where filovirus disease is endemic (although direct contact with the animal reservoir is not usually reported even in confirmed cases)
- • Worked in a laboratory or animal facility where filoviruses are handled
- • Had unprotected sex with a male recovering from filoviral fever in the previous eighteen months.

## **Diagnosis**

Because filovirus disease is often extremely difficult to definitively diagnose on clinical grounds, prompt laboratory confirmation is imperative. Reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) testing for filovirus RNA has become the test of choice because, once samples are inactivated, it can be performed outside of the high containment laboratory, with reagents that are generally commercially available and with field-deployable platforms providing results within hours. Blood and serum are the preferred samples. Sensitivity and specificity of a variety of available RT-PCR assays are generally considered to be over 90%, though extensive evaluation of specific field testing characteristics is needed[.12,13](#page-10-5) False-negative results may occur in patients very early in the course of the disease when virus levels may still be below the threshold of detection, although this can be overcome with highly sensitive assays. In a patient in whom RT-PCR results are negative but for whom filovirus disease is still highly suspected, the patient should be monitored, treated empirically as needed, and retested a few days later when the viral load would normally have risen to a detectable level. Enzymelinked immunosorbent assays for viral antigen and IgM and IgG, virus culture, and immunohistochemistry on postmortem tissues are also variably applied for laboratory diagnosis. These assays generally appear to have sensitivities and specificities above 90%.[12,13](#page-10-5) Various rapid diagnostic tests have been developed but not fully field-evaluated, leaving questions about sensitivity and specificity depending on sample type. Concerns over the ramifications of both false-positive and -negative results have led to considerable reticence to embrace their use, and their place in surveillance and outbreak response remains to be defined. In the United States filoviral fever testing can be arranged through the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (phone: 470-312-0094, email: [spather@cdc.gov](mailto:spather@cdc.gov)). All confirmed cases should be immediately reported to local, state, and federal health authorities.

#### **Differential Diagnosis**

Filovirus disease is rare even in persons demonstrating the risk factors cited earlier, so alternative diagnoses should always be aggressively sought. The differential diagnosis includes a broad array of febrile illnesses that varies by geographic region, including malaria, typhoid fever, shigellosis, other viral hemorrhagic fevers, fulminant viral hepatitis, rickettsial disease, leptospirosis, and meningococcal septicemia. It is important to recognize that coinfections, especially with malaria, may be common and may affect disease severity. Acts of bioterrorism must be considered if filoviral fever is strongly suspected in a patient without any of the aforementioned risk factors, especially if clusters of cases occur. All cases should be immediately reported to local, state, and federal health authorities[.2](#page-10-2)

#### **TREATMENT**

### **Supportive Care**

Patients should be placed in isolation in an intensive care unit where close monitoring and critical supportive care can be provided. Evidence-based consensus guidelines for supportive care for Ebola virus disease have recently been published and include the use of oral and parenteral rehydration, analgesics, and empiric antibiotics; systematic monitoring of fluid and electrolyte status; staff-to-patient ratios; and patient communication with family and friends.[14](#page-10-6) In African settings, either specific malarial testing or empiric antimalarial treatment should be employed. These approaches should be followed for Marburg virus disease as well. Most patients can be supported with oxygen administered by nasal cannula or face mask, although mechanical ventilation may be required in severe cases. Renal replacement therapy has been used in a few cases safely and with apparent success.[15](#page-10-7) Blood products should not be given empirically but only to meet defined clinical and laboratory parameters in the face of clinically significant hemorrhage, taking into consideration the possibility of disseminated intravascular coagulation. Given the extremely high maternal and fetal case fatality associated with filovirus disease in pregnancy, uterine evacuation may be considered. However, this procedure must be performed with extreme caution because it can be considered high risk with regard to potential nosocomial transmission[.2,3,10](#page-10-2)

# **Anti-Viral Therapy**

A number of experimental antiviral drugs have shown promise in animal models and, to a limited degree, in human clinical trials of Ebola virus disease ([Table 37.4.3](#page-7-0))[.3,10,16](#page-10-4) At the time of this writing, a randomized clinical trial of four Ebola virus-specific therapeutics (the antiviral remdesivir and the monoclonal antibody formulations ZMapp, REGN, and mAb114) is being undertaken in an Ebola virus disease outbreak in the northeastern Democratic Republic of the Congo. In addition, the World Health Organization has led the development of the Monitored Emergency Use of Unregistered and Investigational Interventions (MEURI) protocol to gather clinical data and provide ethical guidelines for the compassionate use of experimental compounds for Ebola virus disease in settings where a clinical trial cannot be implemented.[17](#page-10-8) Hundreds of patients were treated under the MEURI protocol while the clinical trial was being set up.

Considerably less study has been devoted to therapeutics for Marburg virus disease; while promising countermeasures have been identified in non-human primates, efficacy and safety data do not exist.

## **Discharge and Monitoring**

Because the patient's clinical status and infectivity correlate with the level of viremia, recovered patients can safely be assumed to have cleared the virus and can be discharged from the hospital without concern of subsequent transmission, with the exception of the risk of sexual transmission (see later). Although undoubtedly a valuable tool, the routine use of PCR has created some confusion here[18](#page-10-9); despite the lack of evidence, a requirement for patients to test PCR negative in blood, and sometimes urine, before discharge has become the norm. The absence of standardization of field PCR assays, as well as of direct evidence associating detectable RNA levels (usually measured by PCR cycle threshold) with infectious virus requires some caution in interpretation. In the worst cases, clinically recovered patients have been confined in isolation units for prolonged periods waiting for very low levels of RNA to finally clear, with potential detrimental effects with regard to both risk of secondary nosocomial infections and mental health. In the many years of clinical management of patients with filovirus disease before PCR or other laboratory testing were routinely available in the field, patients were simply discharged when clinically recovered with no reported cases of secondary transmission, with the exception of rare instances of sexual transmission and potential transmission to infants through breast milk in women infected during pregnancy. Even in these unusual cases, however, a negative blood PCR would not have detected or prevented this event[.19](#page-10-10)

## **Prognosis**

Death from filoviral disease usually occurs within 10 days after the onset of illness. Common indicators of a poor prognosis include shock, bleeding, neurologic manifestations, high viremia (or surrogate measurements of antigen or genome copies), renal dysfunction (elevated serum creatinine), elevated levels of aspartate aminotransferase (>150 IU/L), and pregnancy, especially during the third trimester, in which maternal and fetal mortality may be above 90%. However, mild and even asymptomatic cases have been reported. Reasons for this heterogeneity are largely unknown, although differences in route and dose of infection, underlying comorbid illness, and host genetic predisposition have been postulated.[3,10](#page-10-4)

Although more investigation is needed into the precise pathogenesis of fatal disease, most deaths are thought to result from a process akin to septic shock, when insufficient effective circulating intravascular volume leads to hypotension, cellular dysfunction, and multi-organ system failure. Meningoencephalitis (with evidence of microvesicular occlusion and ischemia on magnetic resonance imaging), renal and respiratory failure, rhabdomyolysis, and cardiac arrhythmias have also been reported and inferred as the cause of death in some patients, but it is not clear whether these reflect organ-specific pathogenesis or are secondary to electrolyte disturbances or systemic inflammatory response syndrome. Another possible cause of sudden death may be thrombotic cardiac or cerebrovascular accidents related to thrombocytosis and a hypercoaguable state that have been documented in early recovery from Ebola virus disease.[3,9,10](#page-10-4)

During the West Africa Ebola virus disease outbreak, the case fatality rate in the 27 patients who received care in the United States and Europe was only 18.5% compared with 31% to 76% reported from West Africa[.3,5,15](#page-10-4) It is unknown whether this discrepancy relates to the use of experimental therapies (of which 85% of patients in high-resource settings received one or more but not in any controlled fashion allowing determination of safety or efficacy), better fluid and electrolyte monitoring and organ support (including mechanical ventilation and renal replacement therapy), genetic predisposition, and/or diminished co-morbidities relative to the West African population.

#### **Sequelae**

Observations from prior filovirus disease outbreaks, recently augmented from the thousands of survivors in West Africa, make it clear that convalescence from Ebola virus disease is difficult and prolonged, with frequent and potentially severe sequelae lasting up to a year or more. Persistent arthralgia, extreme fatigue, ocular complications (including potentially sight-threatening uveitis that may result in early cataract formation), headaches, abdominal pain, and anorexia are very frequent. Less common but reported sequelae include neurologic deficits and hearing loss. Mental health sequelae include sleep and memory disturbances, anxiety disorders, depression, post-traumatic stress disorder,

and "survivors' guilt" in not only survivors but also other family and community members. Characterization of the clinical phenotype, as well as the pathogenesis of these sequelae of filovirus disease, is being studied.[2,3,10,20](#page-10-2)

The management of sequelae is generally supportive, with the exception of uveitis, for which timely diagnosis and urgent treatment with topical or oral corticosteroids and atropine may be sight saving. The World Health Organization has developed clinical care guidelines for management of survivors of Ebola virus disease[.20](#page-10-12)

#### **Virus Persistence and Recrudescence**

Limited data from prior filovirus outbreaks complemented by the large number of survivors from the West Africa Ebola virus outbreak shed light on the potential for filoviruses to persist for months or even years in certain "immunologically privileged" tissue compartments and associated fluids, including the semen of male survivors; aqueous humor of the eye; cerebrospinal fluid of the central nervous system; and the fetus, placenta, and amniotic sac/fluid of women infected during pregnancy. Ebola virus RNA has frequently been detected in the semen of male survivors during the first 3 to 6 months after recovery and in a few men for more than 2 years after acute disease[.3,10,20,21](#page-10-4) The risks of sexual transmission around this persistence are yet to be characterized and appear to be extremely rare; however, male-to-female sexual transmission events associated with re-ignition of outbreaks have been clearly documented, with one outlier event occurring more than 400 days after acute disease.[22](#page-10-13)

A few cases have been noted in which women infected during pregnancy recovered and remained pregnant, only to spontaneously abort a macerated and non-viable fetus in subsequent weeks or months. Ebola virus RNA was found in the products of conception, although confirming the presence of infectious virus by cell culture was generally not logistically possible.[3,10,11,20](#page-10-4) Although no secondary transmission has been reported from these cases, proper infection prevention and control precautions should be taken when attending all births to women who were infected with filoviruses during pregnancy. There is no evidence of virus persistence or transmission risk from deliveries of women who conceived after recovering from Ebola virus disease. Virus persistence has also been documented in Marburg virus disease[.2](#page-10-2)

Two cases of filovirus recrudescence associated with organthreatening inflammation have been noted in persons cared for in high-resource settings with prolonged virus persistence—uveitis at 14 weeks and meningoencephalitis with seizures at 9 months after recovery, respectively. Ebola virus was isolated from the anterior chamber fluid of the eye and the CSF but not the blood. No obvious underlying immunosuppressive condition or trigger for virus reactivation could be identified in these cases, and both eventually cleared the virus and recovered. It remains unknown whether recrudescent disease has also occurred in Africa but escaped detection, or rather reflects rare events following the seeding of immune-privileged sites at high viremia during severe disease (true for both cases) that would likely have been fatal in most African settings without intensive medical care. Anecdotal reports exist of recrudescent disease and viremia in West Africa, in some cases thought to be related to underlying HIV infection, although this association remains unpublished and has not been validated[.3,10,20](#page-10-4)

Despite evidence of filovirus persistence in these selected sites, the only evidence of transmission from a survivor to date is through male-to-female sexual transmission. Consequently, abstinence or safe sex with condoms is recommended until viral RNA clearance from the semen can be confirmed through laboratory testing or, in the absence of available testing, for at least 18 months after recovery. Breastfeeding should be avoided during convalescence unless there is no other way to support the baby.[20](#page-10-12)

# **PREVENTION**

# **Infection Prevention and Control**

Normal barrier nursing precautions to prevent parenteral and droplet exposure to blood and body fluids suffice to prevent infection in most instances, at least early in the course of disease when viremia and virus shedding are low, and should provide a measure of security and comfort to clinicians working in general medicine settings and examining returning travelers. However, these may break down when case counts overwhelm health systems, as seen in the West Africa Ebola virus disease outbreak. Once the diagnosis of filovirus disease is suspected, the patient should be placed in isolation and specific viral hemorrhagic fever precautions implemented. Despite the absence of evidence of aerosol transmission, patients are usually placed in negative-airflow rooms when available, but hermetically sealed isolation chambers are not required. Access to the patient should be limited to a small number of designated staff and family members with specific instructions and training on infection control guidelines and the use of personal protective equipment, including surgical masks, face shields, double gloves, gowns, head and shoe covers, and protective aprons. Although the focus is often on the personal protective equipment, the other essential components of infection prevention and control should not be overlooked, including proper staff-to-patient ratios, waste disposal, and disinfection procedures. Small-particle aerosol precautions should be used when procedures are performed that may generate aerosols, such as endotracheal intubation[.2,6,23](#page-10-2)

#### **Contact Tracing**

The early non-specific presentation of patients with filovirus disease poses a serious challenge to effective epidemiologic surveillance. Fortunately, the low secondary attack rates afford a measure of reassurance, even when cases go unrecognized, as long as proper barrier nursing is maintained. Furthermore, because mild cases, which may be still more difficult to recognize, are usually not very infectious, missed or delayed diagnosis of these patients is unlikely to pose a problem from an infection control standpoint[.2,6,23](#page-10-2)

Contact tracing is recommended *only* for close contacts, defined as persons with unprotected direct contact with a patient during the symptomatic phase of filovirus disease. This group should be monitored daily for evidence of disease for 21 days after their last contact, checking their temperature daily and recording the results in a log. It is prudent to avoid contact with household members that might result in exposure to body fluids, such as sex, kissing, and sharing of utensils for this time. Confinement or laboratory testing of asymptomatic persons, even if close contacts, is not recommended.

#### **Vaccines**

Numerous filovirus vaccines are under development.[3,10,24](#page-10-4) A phase III trial of a recombinant, replication-competent vesicular stomatitis virus-based vaccine expressing a surface glycoprotein of Ebola virus (rVSV-EBOV) showed 100% vaccine efficacy in a trial deploying a ring vaccination strategy conducted during the West Africa Ebola virus disease outbrea[k25](#page-10-14) and has recently been used under expanded access protocols during outbreaks in the Democratic Republic of the Congo. Adverse effects are frequent but mostly minor; transient fever, arthritis, dermatitis, and vasculitis have been reported. Another promising approach, now in phase II clinical trials, is a chimpanzee adenovirus 26 (cAd26) vaccine encoding the surface glycoprotein of Ebola virus, followed by the modified vaccinia Ankara (MVA)—a multi-valent, live, recombinant, replication-incompetent adjuvant expressing antigens of multiple ebolaviruses. Although head-to-head trials have not been conducted, these vaccine approaches are thought to have complementary profiles, with rVSV-EBOV conferring rapid immunity after a single dose and cAd26/MVA providing a longer duration of immunity.

#### **Post-Exposure Prophylaxis**

Post-exposure prophylaxis should be considered only in persons with distinct high-risk exposure, defined as follows: (1) penetration of skin by a contaminated sharp instrument (e.g., needlestick injury); (2) exposure of mucous membranes or broken skin to blood or body secretions (e.g., blood splashing in the eyes or mouth); (3) participation in emergency procedures without appropriate personal protective equipment (e.g., resuscitation after cardiac arrest, intubation, or suctioning); and (4) prolonged (i.e., hours) and continuous contact in an enclosed space without appropriate personal protective equipment. Guidance on options for post-exposure prophylaxis—all experimental and with varied availability on a compassionate use basis—have recently been published[.26](#page-10-15) Fewer prophylactic options are available for Marburg virus disease, although AVI-7288, an experimental phosphorodiamidate morpholino oligomer with positive charges that targets the viral messenger RNA that encodes Marburg virus nucleoprotein, has proven efficacious in infected non-human primates and is safe in humans.

#### **Reservoir Control**

Avoiding contact with bats, primarily by avoiding entry into caves and mines in endemic areas, is a key prevention measure for filoviruses. Personal protective equipment may be indicated for miners and other persons who work in these environments. Humans should also avoid exposure to fresh blood, body fluids, or meat of wild animals, especially bats and non-human primates.
