# **72** Trench Fever

*Philippe Brouqui*

## KEY FEATURES

- • Trench fever is a relapsing, acute febrile disease caused by *Bartonella quintana.*
- • Trench fever is transmitted by body lice.
- • Risk factors are war, famine, displacement, poverty, and crowding in resource-limited settings, and deprived social conditions and homelessness in developed countries; these conditions lead to body lice infestation.
- • Trench fever usually manifests as a sudden febrile illness with headache and post-orbital pain, dizziness, and bone pain, especially of the shins, and may include malaise, chills, anorexia, profuse sweating, and myalgia.
- • Chronic bacteremia after clinical resolution can occur.
- • Diagnosis is usually based on clinical recognition, serologic and molecular tests, or microbiologic culture.
- • Individuals with trench fever should be treated with doxycycline and gentamycin.
- • Prevention usually involves de-lousing by changing/ washing clothes and blankets. Oral ivermectin is an option.

#### **INTRODUCTION**

Trench fever is caused by *Bartonella quintana,* a facultative intracellular bacterium transmitted by the human body louse*, Pediculus humanus corporis,* which lives in clothes. An estimated 1 million people were affected by trench fever during World War I.[1](#page-1-0) Trench fever is today most commonly associated with conditions that predispose to louse infestation, including war, refugee camps, social disaster, overcrowding, and displacement, as well as homelessness[.2](#page-1-1)

#### **NATURAL HISTORY, PATHOGENESIS, AND PATHOLOGY**

Trench fever was first described during World War I. At that time, the causative bacteria and effective treatment were unknown, but the association with trenches, unsanitary conditions, and louse infestation led to the institution of preventive measures, including bathing and de-lousing[.1](#page-1-0) However, the existence of *B. quintana* was likely much older than expected, as DNA was detected in the dental pulp of 4000-year-old human remain[s3](#page-1-2) ; it was also detected in lice found in a mass grave containing remains of soldiers serving in Napoleon's army in Lithuania.[4](#page-1-3)

*B. quintana* multiplies in the louse's intestine, and the bacterium is transmitted by contact with infected louse feces through skin breaks ([Fig. 72.1](#page-1-4)). Bacterial multiplication in body lice starts 4 days after ingestion; *B. quintana* is excreted in louse feces for at least 3 weeks. Persistent bacteremia in humans facilitates its spread back to lice. The bites of body lice can lead to pruritus and scratching, which lead to microabrasions and facilitate transmission of the bacteria ([Fig. 72.2](#page-1-5)). Some humans become chronically bacteremic after resolution of acute illness.[5](#page-1-6)

*B. quintana* is also a cause of bacillary angiomatosis (BA) and peliosis hepatis (PH). These are disorders of vascular hyperproliferation linked with endothelial cell proliferation and pseudo-tumor formation in immunocompromised persons, especially those with advanced HIV infection. As shown with *B. henselae,* some strains of *B. quintana* are involved in vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) secretion, inducing vascular proliferation[.6](#page-1-7)

#### **EPIDEMIOLOGY**

*B. quintana* infection reemerged in the 1990s manifesting as a cause of bacteremia, endocarditis, or BA and PH in immunecompromised hosts. Seroprevalence in body louse–exposed persons ranges from 8% to 56% compared with 0% to 2% in blood donors[.7](#page-1-8) The prevalence of current infection was estimated in this population to be 5.3% by blood culture[.8](#page-1-9) In Peru, 20% of inhabitants of a small village had antibodies against *R. prowazekii* and 12% had antibodies against *B. quintana*.

## **CLINICAL FEATURES**

#### **Trench Fever**

Trench fever is characterized by attacks of fever that last 2 to 4 days and is associated with headache, pain in the shin, and dizziness, which recur every 4 to 6 days, giving rise to trench fever's appellation of *quintane fever* (reflected in its scientific name, *B. quintana*). Dizziness and headaches are sometimes so sudden that soldiers have been known to fall over in the trenches. The incubation period is typically 6 days, but may be extended to 5 to 20 days in experimental infections. Although trench fever often results in prolonged disability, it is rarely fatal.

## **Chronic Infection and Complications Caused by** *B. quintana*

Persistent bacteremia has long been associated with *B. quintana* infection. Asymptomatic and prolonged bacteremia can be detected in 20% to 30% of patients[.8](#page-1-9) *B. quintana* endocarditis is typically diagnosed in homeless, alcoholic persons and persons exposed to body louse infestation.[10](#page-1-11) *Bartonella* species are fastidious growing agents and explain that blood culture may be negative in case of endocarditis.[11](#page-1-12) BA is a proliferative vascular disease of immunodeficient patients (usually individuals with advanced HIV infection), although rare cases in immunocompetent individuals have been reported. BA can be caused by *B. quintana* and *B. henselae,* the cause of cat scratch disease. Various organs may be affected, including the liver, spleen, bone marrow, and lymph nodes, but the skin is most often involved. Cutaneous lesions may be solitary or multiple and may bleed profusely when punctured.

#### **PATIENT EVALUATION AND DIAGNOSIS**

Diagnosis of trench fever is usually based on clinical recognition in the setting of epidemiologic risk factors. Laboratory confirmation may be achieved by blood culture, polymerase chain reaction (PCR) identification of *B. quintana* in the blood, in the serum, on removed cardiac valves, in the body louse, or by immunofluorescent assay (IFA) and Western immunoblotting, especially as support for an endocarditis diagnosis.[10](#page-1-11)

#### <span id="page-1-5"></span>**Tropical Areas**

*B. quintana* has a worldwide distribution, often overlapping war zones, socio-economic disaster, and poor sanitation predisposing to louse infestation. The burden of *B. quintana* infection and trench fever in resource-limited settings is unknown, but trench fever has occurred among refugees in Burundi[12](#page-1-13); *B. quintana*–associated endocarditis has been reported in Ethiopia, Algeria, and Tunisia and in patients with fever in Senegal[13](#page-1-14); and BA has been reported in HIV patients in South Africa.

#### **PREVENTION**

Prevention usually involves de-lousing by changing/washing clothes and blankets at 50°C. Ivermectin is highly efficient at delousing and alleviating the pruritus, but the effect is not sustained and the treatment should be repeated regularly[.14,15](#page-1-15) Permethrinimpregnated underwear should not be used due to the elevated level of resistance of the body louse.[16](#page-1-16)

#### **TREATMENT**

Adults with chronic trench fever or *B. quintana* chronic bacteremia should be treated with doxycycline 200 mg orally daily for 4 weeks and gentamycin 3 mg/kg IV once a day for 2 weeks.[17](#page-1-17) Anectodally, shorter courses of tetracyclines without aminoglycosides have been used to successfully treat individuals with acute trench fever[.17](#page-1-17) Individuals with BA or PH should be treated with erythromycin 500 mg orally four times a day for 3 and 4 months, respectively[.18](#page-1-18)
