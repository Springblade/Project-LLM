# Tapeworm Infections

Karen A. Alroy, Robert H. Gilman

#### **KEY FEATURES**

- There are three main *Taenia* species: *T. saginata*, *T. solium*, and *T. asiatica*. Taeniasis, an adult tapeworm infection within the gastrointestinal system, occurs after ingestion of undercooked beef (*T. saginata*) or pork (*T. solium*, *T. asiatica*) that is infected with larval forms of the tapeworm, termed *cysticerci*. Most intestinal infections are asymptomatic. *T. solium* is also infectious to humans in its larval form, causing cysticercosis (see Chapter 131).
- The broad tapeworm, *Diphyllobothrium latum*, is acquired after eating raw or poorly cooked fish. Most *D. latum* infections are asymptomatic; infections from other *Diphyllobothrium* species are possible.
- Both *Taenia* and *Diphyllobothrium* infections can be prevented by adequate cooking or freezing of beef, pork, or fish.
- The dwarf tapeworm, *Hymenolepis nana*, is acquired after ingestion of eggs in conditions of poor hygiene, usually by children. A large worm burden can cause non-specific gastrointestinal symptoms.
- Infection with the dog tapeworm, Dipylidium caninum, occurs occasionally when a person accidentally swallows an infected flea.
- All of the tapeworms can be treated with praziquantel or niclosamide.

### INTRODUCTION

Human infection with *Taenia* species is one of the most common parasitic infections. These tapeworms cause extensive human morbidity and in their larval form, major livestock losses. Human taeniasis has been documented since antiquity<sup>1,2</sup>; the first life cycles for any tapeworm were demonstrated with *Taenia* almost 150 years ago.<sup>3</sup> Humans are the definitive host for *T. solium*, *T. saginata*, and *T. asiatica*. Other *Taenia* species may cause rare infections in humans. Cysticercosis and neurocysticercosis are common helmenthic infections, the latter affecting the human central nervous system (CNS). They result when humans are accidental intermediate hosts of *T. solium* after ingestion of tapeworm eggs.<sup>4</sup> Although the majority of taeniasis is caused by *T. saginata*, the three *Taenia* species most relevant to human health should be distinguished to evaluate a patient's risk of developing neurocysticercosis (see Chapter 131).

#### **EPIDEMIOLOGY**

### Infection

Taeniasis incidence and prevalence are highest where cattle and swine have access to human fecal contamination and where raw or undercooked beef or pork is consumed. *T. solium* often occurs in areas of poor sanitation where free-roaming pigs become infected with cysticerci, or larval cysts. Urban sewage used to fertilize cattle pastures is a risk factor for *T. saginata* infection.<sup>5</sup>

Because taeniasis is largely transmitted due to meat consumption, infection is uncommon at early ages before meat is consumed. Individuals who neither consume nor raise pork can be at risk

for cysticercosis if they ingest *T. solium* eggs. This was illustrated by orthodox Jews in New York City who acquired cysticercosis through fecal-oral contamination from *T. solium* infected kitchen workers.<sup>6</sup>

#### Geography

Both *T. saginata* and *T. solium* have a global distribution, with an estimated 50 million people infected with *T. saginata* and 5 million with *T. solium.*<sup>7</sup> The prevalence of taeniasis can vary greatly within, and between countries.

High prevalence of *T. saginata* occurs in East Africa, Bali, and Tibetan populations in China.<sup>8</sup> The prevalence of *T. saginata* in humans in Europe is generally low at <1%, but can be up to 10% in isolated areas.<sup>5,9</sup> Prevalence of taeniasis in Mexico ranges from <1% to 2.4%.<sup>10,11</sup> A survey along the Texas–Mexico border showed prevalence of 3%.<sup>12</sup>

The distribution of *T. solium* is limited to areas where pork is consumed; in Muslim countries, the prevalence is low.<sup>13</sup> *T. solium* is endemic in most of Latin America, with the highest prevalence in Peru, Honduras, Ecuador, Guatemala, Bolivia, Venezuela, Brazil, and Mexico.<sup>14,15</sup> Other high-prevalence regions are India, China, Southeast Asia, Slavic countries, and sub-Saharan Africa. Some villages in Uganda report up to 45% of *T. solium* infection in pigs.<sup>14</sup> In North America, most cysticercosis occurs in migrants from Latin America.<sup>16,17</sup>

*Taenia asiatica* is limited to Asia.<sup>18</sup> Prevalence is high where people routinely eat undercooked pork with viscera. It has been documented in Taiwan, Korea, Vietnam, and several provinces in China. In some villages in Indonesia, there is a prevalence as high as 20%.<sup>8,19,20</sup>

# **NATURAL HISTORY, PATHOGENESIS, AND PATHOLOGY**

Adult tapeworms have segmentally arranged hermaphroditic sexual units called *proglottids,* which mature as they progress distally. The most distal (gravid) proglottids are periodically released and can pass intact in human feces or rupture, scattering thousands of environmentally resilient eggs that remain infectious for months ([Fig. 130.1.1](#page-1-0))[.21](#page--1-13)

*T. saginata* worms are the longest of the three (4–12 meters, 1000–2000 proglottids), and gravid proglottids have 12 or more primary uterine branches*. T. solium* worms are shorter (1.5–8 meters, <1000 proglottids), and the proglottid has an identifiable uterine pore with <12 primary uterine branches. *T. asiatica* worms are slightly shorter (4–8 meters, 300–1000 proglottids) but are otherwise indistinguishable from *T. saginata.* The two species are distinct based on molecular phylogenetics.[22](#page--1-14)

*T. saginata* scolexes lack a crown or rostellum with hooks [\(Fig.](#page-2-0) [130.1.2A\)](#page-2-0). The scolex of *T. solium* is about 1 mm wide and possesses four suckers and a distinctive rostellum armed with a double row of large and small hooklets ([Fig. 130.1.2B\)](#page-2-0). *T. asiatica* exhibits a rostellum but lacks hooks[.23](#page--1-15)

*Taenia* life cycles are unique; mammals serve as both definitive and intermediate hosts. The typical *Taenia* life cycle involves two mammalian hosts: a carnivorous or omnivorous definitive host and an herbivorous intermediate host. The definitive host acquires the larvae from consuming infected meat or viscera. The adult-stage worm then develops in the intestinal lumen of the definitive host and sheds gravid proglottids and eggs in the feces[.3](#page--1-1) The intermediate host becomes infected by ingestion of parasite proglottids or eggs.

<span id="page-1-0"></span>**Fig. 130.1.1** Lifecycle of *Taenia saginata* or *Taenia solium.* Humans are definitive hosts for *T. saginata* and *T. solium.* Eggs or gravid proglottids are passed with feces (1). Cattle (*T. saginata*) and pigs (*T. solium*) become infected by ingesting vegetation, or in the case of pigs, human feces, contaminated with eggs or proglottids (2). In the animal's intestine, oncospheres hatch (3), invade the intestinal wall, and migrate to muscle, where they develop into cysticerci. Humans become infected by ingesting raw or undercooked infected meat (4). After ingestion, the cysticercus develops into an adult tapeworm that attaches to the small intestine by its scolex (5). Adult worms produce proglottids, which mature, become gravid, detach from the tapeworm, and migrate to the anus or are passed in the stool. The eggs are released after the proglottids are passed with the feces (6).

<span id="page-2-0"></span>A larval cyst (cysticercus) then develops in the musculature, visceral organs, or CNS (see Chapter 131).

Humans acquire *T. saginata* through consumption of measly beef infected with the larval form. Cattle are the primary intermediate host; however, the parasite can infect water buffalo and yak. Reindeer are a host in northern latitudes[.5](#page--1-3) Once larvae are ingested, the scolex within the cysticercus evaginates through the cyst wall and, using its four suckers, attaches to the jejunal wall. Maturation into adult worms takes 10 to 12 weeks and results in shedding terminal proglottids (10–15 per day) and free eggs in the stool. Adult worms can live as long as 25 years; however, average infections are shorter.

*T. solium* is acquired through consumption of measly pork. Upon ingestion, cysticerci (*Cysticercus cellulosae*) undergo the same process as *T. saginata.* Maturation in the gut takes 5 to 12 weeks, and worms can persist for years. Groups of three to five gravid proglottids can be shed in the stool on a daily basis. *T. solium* eggs remain viable in the environment for many months[.15](#page--1-16) Dogs can be an alternative intermediate host that maintains infection in areas of Asia with dog consumption[.19](#page--1-17)

The life cycle of *T. asiatica* in its definitive host is identical to that of *T. saginata;* however, it begins with consumption of measly pork viscera, especially liver. *T. asiatica* larvae are only found in pigs. They preferentially migrate to and encyst in pig liver. After 4 weeks, the viscera become infectious. Human cysticercosis attributable to *T. asiatica* generally does not occur, however, it is unclear if it is possible.[18](#page--1-12)

Infection is most often with a single *Taenia* worm; multiple tapeworm infections can occur, in which case the size of the tapeworms is inversely proportional to the numbers in the intestine[.24,25](#page--1-18) Worms obtain nourishment through absorption of host nutrients across its body surface (tegument).[8](#page--1-6)

# **CLINICAL FEATURES**

Taeniasis should be suspected in patients who live in or have traveled to endemic areas where consumption of raw or undercooked beef or pork is common. Most adult *Taenia* carriers are asymptomatic. With *T. saginata,* carriers often become aware of infection when motile proglottids migrate through the perianal area or appear in their underwear. *T. solium* proglottids are not motile, and fewer are passed in the stool. Thus the presence of motile segments helps to rule out *T. solium.*

Symptomatic patients complain of mild abdominal discomfort, cramps, colicky pain, nausea, vomiting, fatigue, anorexia, and weight loss[.8](#page--1-6) Intestinal perforation[,26](#page--1-19) intestinal obstruction[,27](#page--1-20) pancreatitis, cholangitis, and cholecystitis as a result of aberrant proglottid migration have rarely been reported[.28–30](#page--1-21)

A history of *T. solium* increases an individual's risk for cysticercosis (see Chapter 131).

# **PATIENT EVALUATION, DIAGNOSIS, AND DIFFERENTIAL DIAGNOSIS**

When proglottids are seen, the differential diagnosis is limited to *Taenia* and *Dipylidium* species. If proglottids are motile, consider *T. saginata* or *D. caninum* [\(Table 130.1.1\)](#page-3-0). Examination of proglottids from stool is most important to rule out a patient's risk of cysticercosis. In patients with non-specific gastrointestinal (GI) symptoms, the differential diagnosis includes other intestinal parasites and primary GI disorders.

# **Microscopy**

Species identification can be made by counting the number of uterine branches in gravid proglottids by light microscopy. Specimens should be collected in saline or water, fixed in formalin, dehydrated in glycerol, and then flattened between two microscope slides. India ink can be injected into the lateral genital pore to enhance visibility of the uterine branches. *T. solium* has fewer than 12 branches, and *T. saginata* and *T. asiatica* have 12 or more, depending on the geographic location.

If mature, non-gravid proglottids are available, *T. solium* will show a three-lobed ovary; *T. saginata* exhibits a vaginal sphincter. The eggs of all *Taenia* species appear identical[.31,32](#page--1-22) *Taenia* eggs consist of a mature six-hooked (hexacanth) embryo, termed an *oncosphere*.

# **Immunologic Tests**

Parasite-specific coproantigens (CoAg) can be detected by immunologic methods. A CoAg enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) for worm somatic or excretory-secretory products is at least twofold more sensitive at identifying human carriers compared with traditional stool examination[.32](#page--1-23) A microplate ELISA and dipstick test have a sensitivity of about 95% with false-negative tests at <1%.[33](#page--1-24) CoAgs disappear from feces within 1 week of successful treatment;[34](#page--1-25) however, they are unable to differentiate between species.

Polymerase chain reaction (PCR), Copro-PCR, can make species-specific diagnoses before treatment[,35–37](#page--1-26) using a single fecal

sample to detect a T. solium oncosphere-specific protein, Tso 31. In a field trial in Peru, this test was 100% sensitive and specific for identifying T. solium and did not cross-react with other parasites.  $^{38,39}$ 

#### **TREATMENT**

All three forms of human taeniasis can be eliminated (85%–98% efficacy) with a single oral dose of niclosamide (2 g PO) or praziquantel (5–10 mg/kg PO). Praziquantel presents a small risk that asymptomatic viable brain cysts of *T. solium* will be activated during treatment, resulting in neurologic sequelae of seizures and headache. For this reason, some consider niclosamide the drug of choice because it is not systemically absorbed. Despite being included on the World Health Organization's (WHO) list of essential drugs, it has been discontinued in the United States. For this reason, some consider niclosamide the drug of choice because it is not systemically absorbed.

During treatment of *T. solium*, autoinfection with parasite eggs can occur. Medications that induce vomiting should be avoided, as retrograde peristalsis may allow gravid proglottids to be digested, leading to hatching of eggs, penetration of larvae, and development of cysticercosis. Some clinicians recommend a bowel purge within 2 hours of treatment. This may prevent release of eggs from disintegrating gravid proglottids. If successful, a purge will also improve the likelihood of recovering an intact tapeworm within

6 to 12 hours, aiding in species identification.<sup>31</sup> Finally, if the scolex of the tapeworm is not expelled, the worm can regenerate within 2 months.<sup>15</sup> Electrolyte–polyethylene glycol solution is more effective than castor oil in producing intact scolexes and proglottids and is the preferred purgative.<sup>25</sup>

Other anti-helminthic drugs used to treat roundworm infections (e.g., albendazole) are not as effective. Nitazoxanide cured *T. saginata* unresponsive to niclosamide, praziquantel, or both and should be considered in resistant cases of taeniasis.<sup>42</sup>

#### PREVENTION AND CONTROL

Infections with *Taenia* can be prevented by adequate cooking or freezing of beef and pork or, in the case of *T. asiatica*, pig liver. Freezing meat kills cysticerci of all species when the internal temperature drops below –5°C (23°F) for at least 4 days, or around –20°C for at least 12 hours. Cooked meat or viscera is safe to eat when it loses its pink color (>70°C), or is "well done."

*T. solium*, causing both taeniasis and cysticercosis, has been identified as a pathogen that has the potential for eradication. On a regional scale, the interruption of *T. solium* transmission has been demonstrated with a health control strategy involving mass treatment and screening in humans and pigs, as well as administration of the TSOL18 porcine vaccine. 44
