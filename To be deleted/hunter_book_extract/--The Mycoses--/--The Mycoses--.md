#### **The Mycoses**

# **81**

### General Principles

*Roderick J. Hay*

#### KEY FEATURES

- • Mycoses are diseases caused by fungi and are among the most common conditions. Fungi are highly successful and have spread widely; they affect humans both indirectly and directly.
- • As agents of spoilage and destruction, they cause serious losses to crops and stored foodstuffs.
- • Several fungi cause disease by invasion of external or internal body surfaces. The type of infection varies from localized superficial colonization of hair shafts to invasive disease with a high mortality.
- • Fungi may also produce toxins that can be highly potent. Outbreaks of mycotoxicoses have been reported in the tropics where individuals or communities consume grain or other produce that has become moldy.
- • Fungi may produce airborne spores, sometimes in very large numbers, that can sensitize atopic subjects, causing symptoms of respiratory allergy after inhalation.
- • Fungal infections are diagnosed by staining and microscopic examination of scrapings, exudates or biopsies, or culture on specialized media; serology can be useful in some cases.
- • Management ranges from the simple application of topical therapies to prolonged, complex, and often toxic systemic treatment.

#### **DISTRIBUTION AND MEDICAL IMPORTANCE**

Some mycoses are restricted geographically; others are worldwide. They may be recognized simply, but, in many instances, the full spectrum of diagnostic aids, including microscopy, culture, gene analysis, and serology, are necessary before an etiology can be established. Although mycoses do not rank with parasites or bacteria as major causes of mortality in the tropics, they are common causes of morbidity, and individual patients can develop progressively disabling or disseminated disease. The World Health Organization (WHO) has recently added mycetoma, chromoblastomycosis, and other deep mycoses to their list of neglected tropical diseases.

Although most fungal infections are acquired exogenously, some mycoses—for example, candidiasis—are initiated by fungi that are a part of the normal human microflora.

#### **MORPHOLOGY**

The basic vegetative organization of most pathogenic fungi is filamentous. In substrates supporting growth, the cells and hyphae are cylindrical or branching, usually about 3 to 5 µm in diameter, bound by a rigid carbohydrate cell wall. They may have septa along their length. Hyphae increase in length only at their tips. Because they regularly send out side branches, new growing tips are constantly formed, and the rate of colonization of the host substrate can increase rapidly.

For many fungi, growth of the vegetative phase in artificial media and in the natural environment is followed by development of a reproductive phase. Fungi produce an enormous range of spore types that are useful in distinguishing different species. Spores are also how the pathogen can gain access to its host. Many spores (conidia) are dispersed in the air, and infection is acquired by the respiratory route. Other fungi—for example, yeasts—are unicellular and reproduce via production of daughter cells by budding.

In several of the more important pathogenic species, fungi may assume one form when growing in their natural habitat (e.g., soil, decaying vegetation) or in culture media and a different form in parasitized tissue (dimorphism). The saprophytic and pathogenic phases in several species—for example, *Histoplasma capsulatum* and *Blastomyces dermatitidis*—correspond to filamentous (hyphal) and yeastlike (budding) growth, respectively.

#### **DIAGNOSIS**

Isolation and identification of the causal agent can be done in the laboratory. Serologic tests can be useful, although they may yield equivocal results. Direct microscopy of skin fragments or scrapings, sputum, or examination of tissue sections stained with special fungal stains (e.g., methenamine silver, Grocott modification, or periodic acid–Schiff [PAS]) can be used to identify the fungal etiology. A feature of most mycoses is the development of a host immune response, including the appearance of specific antibodies. Immunologic tests may be of value in epidemiologic studies (using skin tests to assess previous infection) and in diagnosis (using serology to detect and quantify specific antibodies). Increasingly, molecular methods are used in diagnosis, epidemiology, and for the investigation of pathogenesis, although there are few commercial diagnostic tests.

#### **DISEASE CLASSIFICATION**

Traditionally, mycoses have been classified according to their route of infection and body site.[1–4](#page-1-0)

#### **Superficial Mycoses** (See Chapter 82)

These mycoses—for example, pityriasis versicolor—affect only the outer layers of the epidermis. Living tissues are seldom invaded. Other mycoses, such as tinea, although confined to keratinized parts of the body, can elicit acute or chronic inflammatory changes in the skin. These changes can be painful, unsightly, or disfiguring. Invasion of nails can result in dystrophy. Superficial mycoses can be acute or chronic, inflammatory or non-inflammatory, and unusual among fungal infections—acquired via person-to-person transmission.

#### **Subcutaneous Mycoses or Mycoses of Implantation** (See Chapter 83)

These diseases—for example, mycetoma—are introduced through the skin surface by a penetrating wound, such as a thorn prick or splinter wound. The agents are usually environmental saprophytes. Once established, they provoke an intense and destructive host response. The lesions tend to be localized and progressive, usually without a tendency to heal spontaneously.

#### **Systemic Mycoses** (See Chapters 84 and 85)

Some of the respiratory mycoses—for example, histoplasmosis—are acquired by inhalation of airborne spores, with the initial site of multiplication in the lung. Although most infections are self-limiting, serious progressive or disseminated disease occurs in a small proportion of patients, particularly those who are immunocompromised. Opportunistic mycotic infections (see Chapter 84)—for example, invasive aspergillosis—can infect because of the susceptibility of the host, rather than an inherent pathogenicity of the fungus. They occur in patients who are immune compromised by AIDS, leukemia, diabetes, and malnutrition, by defects in the immune system, by cancer or transplantation chemotherapy, or by treatment with broad-spectrum antibiotics.

### **DERMATOPHYTE INFECTION: RINGWORM, TINEA Introduction**

The dermatophytes cause infections (ringworm or tinea) that are confined to the superficial stratum corneum, as well as keratinized structures, for example, hair or nail arising from skin.[1](#page-6-0) In temperate climates, tinea pedis affects the inter-digital spaces on the feet and is the most common symptomatic form of ringworm; in the tropics, groin, body, and scalp infections are more prevalent. Infections are derived from three main sources: humans (anthropophilic), animals (zoophilic), and soil (geophilic). Zoophilic infections tend to produce lesions of the scalp or body and are often highly inflammatory. The anthropophilic organisms can cause lesions in any site and, depending on the species involved, the inflammatory response is often minimal. Organisms originating from soil are uncommon. The fungi that cause dermatophyte infections in humans are confined to three genera, defined by culture or genetic characteristics: *Trichophyton, Microsporum,* and *Epidermophyton.*

#### **Epidemiology**

The most common cause of ringworm worldwide is *Trichophyton rubrum* ([Table 82.1](#page-3-0)). *T. violaceum* has been isolated mostly from patients in India and the Far and Middle East.

Distribution of agents of scalp ringworm throughout the tropical world is complex.[2](#page-6-1) In sub-Saharan Africa, there is considerable variation in the types of scalp ringworm. Frequently, small pockets of infection with distinct organisms occur, for example, *Microsporum audouinii* in West Africa and *T. violaceum* in North Africa, India, East Africa, and the Middle East. The factors underlying this pattern include the stability of the population, absence of control measures, and, on occasion, spread via external agents such as hair care equipment.[3](#page-6-2)

Tinea imbricata caused by *T. concentricum* is most common in the Pacific Islands and Melanesia, but reports of the disease in isolated populations, often living in primitive conditions, have been reported from Malaysia, India, Brazil, and Mexico.

#### **Natural History, Pathology, and Pathogenesis**

Infection follows transfer from an individual or animal source by contact. Host resistance to dermatophytosis depends on several innate and acquired immunologic factors. These include increased epidermal turnover and locally produced peptides such as β defensins and fatty acids. Acquired immunity is mediated through T lymphocyte (Th1) cytokines such as interleukin (IL)-17, although its effectiveness is reduced in non-inflammatory infections—for example, the soles of the feet and tinea imbricata.

#### **Clinical Manifestations**

The clinical features of dermatophytosis depend on the site of infection. In temperate areas, occluded surfaces, such as the groin, toe webs, and axillae, are most often infected, but in the tropics any site can be involved.

#### **Foot Infections**

*Athlete's foot,* or tinea pedis, is a term used to describe scaling and maceration accompanied by itching between the toes, particularly the fourth interdigital space. It is a syndrome that may be caused by *Candida* species, erythrasma, or gram-negative bacteria, as well as by dermatophytes. In dermatophyte infections, the area between the toes may be wet or dry, and in some infections, particularly those caused by *T. interdigitale,* vesicular. Involvement of the dorsum of the foot or the sole may occur. The commonest cause is *T. rubrum.*

Symptoms may be minimal. It is more common in people who wear shoes and socks and is therefore associated with urban areas in the tropics.

Tinea pedis in tropical areas must be distinguished from eczema and, less commonly, plantar psoriasis[.4](#page-6-3) The interplay between bacteria and fungi is poorly understood, but in the tropics, secondary gram-negative bacterial infection can occur.

Two non-dermatophyte fungi (*Neoscytalidium dimidiatum* and *N. hyalinum*) cause infections that closely resemble the dry type of palmar, plantar, interdigital, and nail infections caused by *T. rubrum*.

#### **Tinea Imbricata**

Tinea imbricata, or Tokelau, is characterized by the appearance of homogeneous sheets or concentric rings of scaling that may cover large areas of the body ([Fig. 82.1\)](#page-3-1).

#### **Tinea Cruris (Ringworm of the Groin)**

Dermatophyte infections of the groin are frequently seen. A ring of itchy erythema with a scaling margin radiates from the groin down the inner border of the thigh ([Fig. 82.2](#page-3-2)). Tinea cruris is

<span id="page-3-3"></span>more common in males and may extend posteriorly to include the intergluteal cleft. In women, an extensive form of ringworm may be found in the waist area that involves a large part of the skin surface around the hip girdle. *Candida* intertrigo may closely resemble tinea cruris.

#### **Tinea Corporis (Ringworm of the Body)**

The characteristic lesion of dermatophyte infection on trunk or limbs is an annular plaque with a varying degree of erythema and a prominent edge (kerion) [\(Fig. 82.3\)](#page-3-3). Scaling is most prominent at this margin[6](#page-6-5) ; however, appearance varies with the organism and host. Particularly in the tropics, *T. rubrum* can be associated with persistent and minimally inflammatory tinea corporis. Increased inappropriate use of powerful topical corticosteroids is associated with widespread tinea corporis. Discoid eczema, impetigo, psoriasis, and discoid lupus erythematosus can be mistaken for ringworm.

#### **Tinea Capitis (Ringworm of the Scalp)**

Invasion of scalp hairs is seen with certain dermatophytes. In some, particularly those spread from animals, scalp hairs often break several millimeters above the skin surface. There can be considerable exudation and erythema. In other infections, including many of those spread from child to child, the onset is insidious. Hairs break at scalp level, and inflammation can be minimal. Most cases present with hair loss, usually in patches, and a varying degree of scaling [\(Fig. 82.4](#page-4-0)). However, kerions (very inflammatory pustular lesions) can develop.

Favus, a scalp infection seen in some parts of Africa, for example, Ethiopia, presents with hair loss accompanied by the formation of crusts or scutula. These tend to coalesce to form a dense mat in patches or large areas of the scalp. The diagnosis of tinea capitis is facilitated by filtered ultraviolet light examination (Wood's light), although only *Microsporum* species fluoresce under these conditions. Ringworm of the scalp must be distinguished from seborrheic dermatitis, psoriasis, or cicatricial alopecia. The last may be produced in end-stage favus.

#### **Onychomycosis**

Dermatophyte invasion of the nails is uncommon in the tropics. The nail plate is invaded from the distal border and lateral surfaces, usually from the underside. The affected nail becomes thickened and opaque with a varying degree of onycholysis. Patients often have infection of other sites, such as the soles or toe webs. In addition to psoriasis, other fungal infections, such as candida or

<span id="page-4-0"></span>*Neoscytalidium,* must be differentiated from onychomycosis caused by dermatophytes.[7](#page-6-6)

#### **Dermatophytosis of Other Sites**

Dermatophytosis of the beard area (tinea barbae) may be highly inflammatory and persistent. Involvement of the palms is most commonly with *T. rubrum.* Often, only one hand is involved, and the fingernails on that side may be invaded. The palm shows mild scaling like the dry type of sole infection.

#### **Diagnosis**

Although not essential, laboratory diagnosis is helpful, as the clinical diagnosis is not always reliable—particularly in scalp ringworm. Scrapings or a hair sample can be taken from the lesion with a scalpel, mounted in 10% potassium hydroxide, and examined with a microscope.

#### Culture and Molecular Diagnosis

Scrapings or hairs can be plated onto Sabouraud's agar. Their gross and microscopic appearance, as well as nutritional requirements, are used in identification. Molecular probes can also be used to identify and type organisms, but are not widely available.

#### **Treatment**

#### Topical Therapy

Dermatophytoses can be treated topically. Whitfield's ointment (BPC), which contains 3% salicylic acid and 3% benzoic acid, is a weak antifungal agent but is inexpensive and effective in treating all dermatophyte infections apart from scalp or nail disease, or kerion.

#### Topical Antifungals

Antifungal compounds include imidazole creams or ointments (miconazole, clotrimazole, econazole, and bifonazole) and terbinafine.[8](#page-6-7) All are available for topical therapy in 1% to 2% concentration. Many are also effective against candidiasis and pityriasis versicolor. Topical antifungals have no place in the management of tinea capitis.

#### <span id="page-4-1"></span>**TABLE 82.2** Predisposing Factors in Superficial Candidiasis

Infancy, pregnancy, old age

Occlusion of epithelial surfaces, for example, by dentures, occlusive dressings

Disorders of immune function

Primary, for example, chronic granulomatous disease Secondary, for example, HIV/AIDS, leukemia, corticosteroid therapy

Chemotherapy

Immunosuppressive

Antibiotic

Endocrine disease, for example, diabetes mellitus

Carcinoma

Miscellaneous, for example, damaged nail folds

#### Systemic Therapy

For nail and scalp disease or extensive or severe infections, including kerion, systemic treatment is necessary. Griseofulvin is given in a daily dose of 500 to 1000 mg in adults or 10 mg/kg in children. For scalp infections, 6 to 8 weeks of treatment are usually necessary. More rapid treatment for these indications is provided by terbinafine (50–250 mg daily, lower doses in children depending on weight) and itraconazole (100–400 mg daily)[.9](#page-6-8) These agents shorten the treatment period and provide effective therapy, and in many countries generic forms are available.

#### **SUPERFICIAL CANDIDIASIS**

#### **Definition**

These superficial infections are caused by species of the genus *Candida.* They include thrush and vaginal candidiasis, as well as interdigital candidiasis[.10](#page-6-9)

#### **Epidemiology**

Candidiasis occurs throughout the world*. Candida albicans* is the organism most commonly associated with superficial candidiasis; however, other species, such as *C. tropicalis* or *C. guilliermondii,* can be involved. *C. albicans* is a common saprophyte on mucosal surfaces, particularly in the mouth, gastrointestinal tract, and vagina. Oral colonization may begin in infancy, although its incidence is increased by several factors, including hospitalization and bottlefeeding. *C. albicans* can be isolated from the environment, often where contact with humans is frequent, such as wash basins and drinking fountains.

#### **Natural History and Pathogenesis**

When *C. albicans* causes infection as opposed to colonization, it is usually in individuals with predisposing factors ([Table 82.2](#page-4-1)). Some of these factors are systemic, and others relate to local conditions on the skin or mucosa. The effect of climate on infection is unknown, although in the tropics there is a high incidence of saprophytic carriage of *Candida* species.

#### **Clinical Manifestations**

#### Oral Candidiasis (Thrush)

This is common, particularly in the elderly, infants, and denture wearers[.11](#page-6-10) It can follow immunosuppression or antibiotic therapy and can be an important marker of AIDS. Infection presents with

solitary or confluent white plaques on the oral mucosa (pseudomembranous candidiasis). Alternatively, the mucosa may appear glazed and erythematous (erythematous candidiasis). One of the earliest features of oral candidiasis is the appearance of cracking at the angles of the mouth, or angular cheilitis. Oral candidiasis in AIDS patients is often accompanied by esophageal infection[.12](#page-6-11)

#### Vaginal Candidiasis

Vaginal infection with *Candida* is common, and although it can be associated with diabetes and the third trimester of pregnancy, most of those affected do not have an underlying abnormality. The symptoms of vaginal candidiasis are irritation and discomfort associated with a creamy discharge. Similar to oral infection, the vaginal mucosa can be covered with small white plaques or become red and friable. Infection must be distinguished from *Trichomonas* and gonorrhea. Candidiasis of the groin is erythematous with a prominent border. Small "satellite" pustules or crusts are often seen outside this border.

#### Paronychia and *Candida* Onychomycosis

Infection of the nail folds by *Candida* species is a cause of paronychia. The periungual skin is raised and painful, and a prominent gap develops between the fold and the nail plate. Rarely, invasion of the nail plate with onycholysis occurs. The condition is caused by several factors, including bacterial infection, although those with heavy domestic responsibilities (e.g., washing, cooking) seem to be predisposed. Superficial erosion on the web space between the fingers can also be caused by *Candida* infection in the tropics.

#### *Candida* Intertrigo

*Candida intertrigo* is the name given to a painful or irritative inflammatory dermatosis confined to body folds; secondary bacterial infections can contribute to the process. Infection is most common in overweight or diabetic subjects.

#### **Diagnosis**

Laboratory diagnosis is made by demonstration of *Candida* in potassium hydroxide wet mounts. Yeast and hyphal forms are both seen. *Candida* can be cultured on Sabouraud's agar. Molecular diagnostic methods are available, but are usually reserved for systemic infections.

#### **Treatment**

Locally applied amphotericin, nystatin, or an imidazole preparation in creams, powders, lotions, and/or pessaries (vaginal tablets) are effective.Oraltreatmentsforsuperficial candidiasis are fluconazole, itraconazole, voriconazole, and posaconazole. These should be reserved for severe oral or chronic candidiasis. AIDS patients with oral candidiasis should usually be treated with fluconazole, but may respond to topical therapy[.13](#page-6-12) Resistance to fluconazole can develop if the drug is continuously employed in clinically unresponsive infection. Vaginal infections respond to intensive topical therapy given for 3 to 5 days using a combination of cream and pessaries; however, a single dose of fluconazole is more effective and convenient. *Candida glabrata,* which is usually resistant to fluconazole, is increasingly seen as a cause of vulvovaginal candidiasis.

#### **PITYRIASIS (TINEA) VERSICOLOR**

#### **Introduction**

Pityriasis versicolor is caused by the lipophilic yeast, *Malassezia,* and is widespread in the tropics. *Malassezia* species are present as saprophytes on normal skin. At least six species are commonly found. Development of pityriasis versicolor lesions is usually accompanied by the formation of short, stubby hyphae. Rarely, disease can occur in immunocompromised individuals, although seldom in HIV infection.

#### **Epidemiology**

Infection occurs throughout the world and is extremely common in the tropics, where, in some areas, 60% of the population may be infected.

#### **Pathology and Pathogenesis**

*Malassezia* normally inhabits the superficial layers of keratin, particularly around the orifices of hair follicles, as a normal part of the skin microbiome[.14](#page-6-13)

The development of hyphal forms can be observed during immunosuppressive therapy, which suggests that immune factors play a role in preventing infection. Exposure to sunlight, heat, and humidity, as well as locally applied oils, are thought to be risk factors.

#### **Clinical Manifestations**

The lesions of pityriasis versicolor are small, scaling macules that are hypopigmented or hyperpigmented ([Fig. 82.5](#page-5-0)).[15](#page-6-14) Scaling is usually not prominent, but can be elicited by scratching affected areas. This feature is helpful in distinguishing this infection from other types of macular pigmentary disorders, for example, vitiligo. Under Wood's light, the patches can fluoresce pale yellow. The areas most commonly infected are the upper trunk, upper arms, and neck. In the tropics, infection can extend beyond these areas to involve the face, abdomen, lower arms, and penis. The rash is rarely symptomatic.

#### **Diagnosis**

The diagnosis can be confirmed by demonstration of clusters of yeast and pseudo-hyphae in potassium hydroxide mounts.

#### **Treatment**

Application of 2.5% selenium sulfide twice daily for 7 to 10 days is usually effective. The response to a topical imidazole, such as the shampoo form of ketoconazole used as a wash, may be more rapid, and 5 days of 200 mg itraconazole is also reported to be effective.

#### **OTHER SUPERFICIAL MYCOSES**

#### **Black Piedra**

Black piedra is an uncommon, persistent infection confined to hair shafts and is seen in small endemic areas in the tropics, for example, Latin America or Central Africa.Individual or case clusters can occur. The hallmark of this condition is the presence of small, gritty nodules on hair shafts. These represent areas of hyphal invasion in which characteristic spores (ascospores) of the organism *Piedraia hortae* can be found.

#### **White Piedra**

White piedra is caused by the yeasts *T. inkin, T. cutaneumi,* or *T. ovoides.* The clinical appearances are similar to those of black piedra, although the swellings are "softer" and pale[.16](#page-6-15) The infected sites may involve hair on the scalp, groin, or, rarely, the axillae. Infections are not commonly diagnosed, but have been recognized in different climates, from temperate to tropical.

#### **Tinea Nigra**

Tinea nigra is a superficial tropical infection caused by a black yeast, *Phaeoanellomyces werneckii,* and is associated with focal areas of hyperpigmentation, usually on the palms or soles.[17](#page-6-16) Infection occurs primarily in Central and South America, as well as in the Far East. Characteristically, the lesion is a dark brown or black stain that appears on the palms or the soles and, on rare occasions, elsewhere. There is little scaling, and multiple lesions are rare. The diagnosis can be confirmed by demonstration of characteristic darkly pigmented arthrospores in scrapings. The infection responds to topical azoles or Whitfield's ointment.
