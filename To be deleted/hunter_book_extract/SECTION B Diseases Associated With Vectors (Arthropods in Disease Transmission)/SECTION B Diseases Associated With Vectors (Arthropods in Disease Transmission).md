*Marcelo Ramalho-Ortigao, Duane J. Gubler*

#### KEY FEATURES

- • Vector-borne diseases are among the most important global public health problems and are associated with significant economic burden in affected countries.
- • Vector-borne diseases occur primarily in tropical and subtropical regions and are transmitted by hematophagous arthropods, including mosquitoes, ticks, sand flies, and triatomine bugs.
- • Globally, the most important vector-borne diseases are caused by viruses; however, in Africa, malaria is the most important.
- • Most vector-borne diseases exist in complex zoonotic cycles involving a variety of birds, rodents, and other vertebrate hosts.
- • The emergence and re-emergence of vector-borne diseases in the past 40 years has been driven by population growth, urbanization, globalization, and lack of public health infrastructure.

#### **HISTORY**

Although early scholars recognized a relationship between arthropods and illness in humans and animals, the concept of disease transmission by insects is relatively new. The first demonstration that a parasite of humans required a developmental phase in an insect to complete its life cycle occurred about 135 years ago. Sir Patrick Manson, working in China in 1877, showed that the human filarial parasite *Wuchereria bancrofti* required an obligatory period of development in the mosquito *Culex pipiens fatigans* (*Cx. pipiens quinquefasciatus*). This discovery was followed over the next 30 years by a series of observations that demonstrated transmission of protozoa, helminths, viruses, and bacteria by ticks, flies, mosquitoes, fleas, and lice.[1](#page-6-0) Since that time, many important pathogens of humans and animals have been shown to depend on arthropods to complete their transmission cycles.

The pathogens transmitted to humans by arthropods fall into four categories: nematodes or roundworms, protozoa, bacteria (including rickettsiae and spirochetes), and viruses. Some are true parasites of humans (e.g., *W. bancrofti* and *Plasmodium falciparum*), but most are zoonotic, with other primary vertebrate hosts (reservoirs or amplifying hosts). In these cases, humans become an incidental host, and although they may contribute to the transmission cycle on a temporary basis, they are not required for survival of the pathogen in nature.

#### **DISEASE TRANSMISSION**

The order Diptera is by far the most important with regard to disease vectors, primarily because of the family Culicidae (mosquitoes). Ticks (family Ixoxoidea) are the second most important disease vectors. Most vector-borne pathogens are zoonoses (pathogens of animals) and have a primary vertebrate reservoir host and a primary arthropod vector that maintains the transmission cycle in nature; this is usually via horizontal transmission but is sometimes facilitated by transovarial or vertical transmission (see later). This primary cycle is usually inapparent in humans and domestic animals. On occasion, the pathogen may be introduced into the peridomestic or urban environment by secondary vectors or by the vertebrate host, which often establishes a secondary transmission cycle involving other vertebrate hosts and arthropod vectors. Humans and domestic animals are usually infected by bridge vectors from these secondary cycles and are often dead-end or incidental hosts, not contributing to the transmission cycle. Recent studies suggest, however, that humans may in fact play a previously unappreciated role as reservoir during the transmission of pathogens and parasites in what is typically referred to as *anthropogenic transmission* (e.g., visceral leishmaniasis caused by *Leishmania donovani* in India and Sudan). A basic vector-borne pathogen transmission cycle is shown in [Fig. 147.1.](#page-1-0) An arthropod can transmit a pathogen from one person or animal to another in one of two basic ways.

#### **Mechanical Transmission**

Defined as transfer of a pathogen present on contaminated mouthparts or other body parts. There is no multiplication or developmental change of the pathogen on or in the insect. Examples include some enteroviruses, bacteria, and protozoa of human and veterinary importance. Insects, such as houseflies, can become contaminated with such pathogens while feeding on feces and transfer them to food. Parasites such as *Trypanosoma vivax* (of African origin) are transmitted to cattle in South America via the bite of tabanid flies.

#### **Biologic (or Horizontal) Transmission**

The second and most important type of disease transmission by arthropods is biologic. The pathogen must undergo development in the insect vector in order to complete its life cycle. There are four types of biologic transmission.

#### Propagative

The pathogen is ingested with a blood meal and undergoes simple multiplication within the vector. Examples are the arboviruses, which replicate extensively in the tissues of the arthropod and are transmitted to a new host in the saliva when another blood meal is taken. The plague-causing bacteria *Yersinia pestis,* transmitted by the bite of infected fleas, also is in this category.

#### Cyclopropagative

The pathogen undergoes a developmental cycle (changes from one stage to another) and multiplication within the vector. Classic examples of cyclopropagative transmission include *Plasmodium*

(malaria), in which a single ookinete, formed after gametogenesis, may give rise to thousands of sporozoites and *Leishmania* (leishmaniasis), in which infective metacyclic promastigotes develop after tissue amastigotes change to promastigotes and multiply.

#### Cyclodevelopmental

The pathogen undergoes developmental changes from one stage to another but does not multiply. With the filariae, for example, a single microfilaria ingested by a mosquito can result in only one infective third instar (L3) larva. In most instances, however, the number of infective larvae is lower than the number of microfilariae ingested with the blood meal.

#### Transovarial or Vertical

Some viral and rickettsial disease agents are transmitted from the female parent arthropod through the eggs to the offspring. If the pathogen can infect the developing egg germ cells, it is termed *transovarial transmission*. With some arboviruses, only the ovarial sheath and oviduct are infected; the egg is infected as it passes down the oviduct and is inseminated. This is called *vertical transmission*. In either case, the newly hatched larval stages are infected with the pathogen, which is then transmitted to subsequent developmental stages of the arthropod (transstadial transmission). Finally, venereal transmission of certain viruses has also been documented. Male mosquitoes that become infected transovarially or vertically can transfer the infective virus to female mosquitoes in the seminal fluid during copulation. These latter types have some epidemiologic importance in the infection of humans and animals, and in the maintenance of the pathogen in nature.

#### **Extrinsic Incubation Period**

In all types of biologic transmission, a period of time is required for the pathogen to develop (or multiply, depending on the case) within the arthropod vector and be able to be transmitted. For a number of parasites, including filarial worms, *Plasmodium,* and

The three principal barriers are the mosquito midgut barrier, associated with the ability of the virus to infect and replicate within midgut cells; the mosquito escape barrier, associated with the ability of the virus to disseminate; and the transmission barrier, associated with the invasion of the salivary glands *(SG)*. The illustration shows viruses *(blue)* present in the bloodmeal within the midgut and enveloped by the mosquito's peritrophic matrix. *DD*, Dorsal diverticulum; *Es*, esophagus; *FG*, foregut; *HG*, hindgut; *MT*, Malpighian tubules; *Pr*, proboscis.

*Leishmania,* it requires change from a non-infective to an infective stage that can be successfully transmitted during blood feeding by the vector. This period between infection of the arthropod vector and transmission is called the *extrinsic incubation period (EIP).* The EIP may vary between 3 and 14 days, depending on the pathogen, the vector, and various environmental factors, including temperature.

#### **Entomologic Inoculation Rate**

The entomologic inoculation rate (EIR) defines the number of infected bites an individual may receive during a period of time, be it a day, a month, or a year. EIR is important to define risk of exposure to vector-borne disease, along with several other biotic and abiotic factors.

#### **Barriers to Pathogen Development**

Generally, transmission requires an ability of the pathogen to escape barriers in the vector that are generally associated with vector competence. For example, viruses must overcome the midgut infection barrier and the midgut escape barrier to reach the hemolymph (blood), be disseminated, and ultimately invade the salivary glands (transmission barrier).[2](#page-6-1) For *Plasmodium,* escape from the peritrophic matrix that envelops the blood meal, invasion of midgut cells and ability to survive the mosquito's innate immune responses, and invasion of the salivary glands by the infectious sporozoites are limiting steps for parasite development and transmission [\(Fig. 147.2](#page-1-1)). Several such barriers have also been identified for other vector–pathogen pairs. It is important to realize that, in many instances, a pathogen and a vector co-evolved so that the vector may indeed transmit the pathogen. Hence, not all arthropods may be able to transmit a given pathogen.

#### **Factors Influencing Transmission**

The ability of insects to transmit an agent depends on the interaction of complex intrinsic and extrinsic factors. Successful mechanical transmission depends on the degree of contact insects have with humans and on the arthropod feeding behavior. For example, the domestic housefly has been incriminated as a mechanical vector of various intestinal pathogens, primarily because this insect breeds in large numbers, lives in intimate contact with humans, and has the habit of feeding on feces and food. Tabanidae flies (horseflies) are efficient mechanical vectors of viruses and protozoa because of frequent interrupted blood feeding. Certain flies can mechanically transmit the bacteria that cause yaws and other tropical diseases from open sores.

The ability to transmit a pathogen biologically varies greatly among species of arthropods and even among geographic strains or isolated populations within a species. There can be variation in the susceptibility to becoming infected and subsequently to transmitting a pathogen. Thus, for example, within a single mosquito species, it is common to find geographic strains that are good and poor vectors. Because vector competence (susceptibility to infection, growth of the pathogen, and transmission) is genetically controlled, it may be expected to change as a result of selective pressures on either the pathogen or the arthropod over time.

In addition to innate susceptibility to infection, the overall vectorial capacity is influenced by other biologic and behavioral characteristics of the arthropod. The degree of contact the species has with humans is influenced by the blood meal host preference; the intrinsic blood-feeding and resting behavior of the arthropod; and the population density of the vector, animal, and human hosts. Longevity, resting behavior, flight behavior, and oviposition (breeding) behaviors are important intrinsic factors that are influenced by extrinsic environmental factors, such as temperature, humidity, wind, and rainfall.

Other extrinsic factors may influence whether an individual insect becomes infected with a pathogen. For example, it has been shown that mosquitoes ingesting blood containing both microfilariae and Rift Valley fever virus have a higher viral infection rate because disseminated virus infection is facilitated by microfilariae escaping from the midgut into the hemocoel. Finally, infection of the arthropod and subsequent transmission is influenced by the strain of pathogen. This is especially important with the arboviruses, where certain strains or subtypes of virus have greater infectivity and more rapid replication in the vectors.[3](#page-6-2)

Because arthropods are cold-blooded, transmission of diseases in temperate regions is seasonal, usually only occurring during warm months. Cessation of transmission in these regions is usually determined by temperature and day length. In the tropics and subtropics, transmission generally occurs year-round. In these areas, increased seasonal transmission is most frequently correlated with the rainy season.

Finally, it has been shown that vector saliva plays important roles during transmission due to its anti-hemostatic, antiinflammatory, and immunomodulatory activities.[4](#page-6-3) Recently it has also been shown that bacteria present in the vector gut and deposited on the skin during the bite elicit immune responses that can be associated with certain clinical outcomes[.5](#page-6-4)

#### **IMPORTANCE**

Collectively, arthropods are responsible for hundreds of millions of cases of disease each year. The most important vector-borne diseases of man and domestic animals are presented in [Table 147.1](#page-3-0). Vector-borne diseases are closely associated with changes in the environment, they present the world community with one of its greatest health problems, and they are a threat to regional and global economic security[.6](#page-6-5) Recently the refugee crisis in the Middle East with migratory movements from endemic areas or transmission of vector-borne diseases contributed toward an increase in the number of vector-borne and other previously controllable diseases, while placing public health systems under strain[.7](#page-6-6) The role of such "drivers of disease transmission" (e.g., migratory movements, poverty, and rapid urbanization) on vector-borne diseases is well documented[.8](#page-6-7) Migratory movements of persons from an endemic to a non-endemic area of transmission, where competent vectors may exist, could ignite new transmission foci. Disease-unfamiliar health providers in areas affected by a new vector-borne disease may be challenged in the appropriate diagnosis and treatment approach. A thorough medical history, with special focus on travel history and understanding of geographic distribution of disease vectors, is relevant.

For example, cases of malaria are imported into the United States with many fatalities, mainly because of late diagnosis and treatment. With anopheline vectors in many areas of the United States, there has been sporadic transmission documented in some coastal states, including California, New Jersey, Georgia, Florida, and Virginia. Similarly, many cases of dengue are imported into the United States each year. The principal vector, *Aedes aegypti,* and a secondary vector, *A. albopictus,* occur in many states [\(Fig.](#page-2-0) [147.3](#page-2-0)), with autochthonous transmission of dengue reported in Texas and Florida[.9](#page-6-8) Another virus, West Nile, introduced in New York in 2001, quickly spread throughout the United States due to bird migration and the distribution of its principal vector, *Culex pipiens.* As of 2017, West Nile virus is found in 47 states and the District of Columbia, with over 2000 cases annually and >50% leading to neuroinvasive complications such as meningitis and encephalitis.

In tropical regions, the incidence of dengue has increased dramatically, occurring not only as larger and more frequent epidemics but also newly occurring in some countries. Moreover, severe and fatal dengue hemorrhagic fever has also spread geographically and is now a major public health problem in Asia, the Pacific, and the Americas. Viruses like yellow fever, Japanese encephalitis, Chikungunya, Rift Valley fever, O'nyong-nyong, and Zika have expanded their geographic distribution and caused major epidemics. In 2007 Chikungunya was introduced to Italy from India, causing the first outbreak in Italy[.10](#page-6-10) In 2015 Chikungunya found its way to South America and, more recently, to Brazil. Zika has come under the surveillance of the U.S. Public Health Service over the severe outcomes diagnosed in newborns, a risk of sexual transmission, and the threat it poses to several locations in the United States, with the Centers for Disease Control (CDC) issuing an "advisory notice" to people traveling or living in Miami-Dade County, South Florida, where Zika cases were reported in 2016. As of February 2017, over 5000 cases had been reported in the United States, with an additional 40,000 cases in Puerto Rico, the U.S. Virgin Islands, and American Samoa[.11](#page-6-11) Such events underscore the need for physicians in non-endemic areas to be aware of vector-borne diseases and to be knowledgeable about their diagnosis and treatment.

The now nearly ubiquitous presence of *A. aegypti* in the American tropics has put the region at the highest risk for urban epidemics of yellow fever in more than 60 years. This became even more evident with the recent outbreaks (in 2017 and continuing into 2018) of sylvatic yellow fever in Brazil, including areas near or adjacent to large urban centers in the country's southeast region

*SFNV*, Sand fly Naples virus; *SFSV*, sand fly Sicilian virus; *TOSV*, Toscana virus.

<span id="page-5-0"></span>It is still unclear what the vector of Bourbon virus is.

<span id="page-5-1"></span><sup>^</sup>Deer (*Odocoileus virginianus*) are suspected, as it is the most common host for *Amblyomma americanum.*

<span id="page-5-2"></span><sup>+</sup>Houhmadi and Raoult demonstrated that the body lice *Pediculus humanus* can transmit *Rickettisia rickettsii* and *R. conorii* to rabbits.[12](#page-6-9)

<sup>\*</sup>According to the CDC (<https://www.cdc.gov/stari/disease/>) it is not yet clear if *Borrelia lonestari* is the causative agent of STARI.

(e.g., São Paulo). From December 2016 until June 2017, there were nearly 800 confirmed yellow fever cases, with 261 deaths, according to the Brazilian Ministry of Health. Other yellow fever outbreaks also occurred in Africa, in Angola (the first yellow fever epidemic in 30 years), and in the Democratic Republic of the Congo in 2016, causing nearly 1000 confirmed cases with roughly 400 people dead, according to the World Health Organization. Several factors are responsible for this dramatic re-emergence of epidemic vector-borne disease[.6](#page-6-5) The successes in controlling vectors and vector-borne disease led to complacency, redirection of resources, and deterioration in public health infrastructure; add to these the anthroponotic changes in the environment, and the result has been a dramatic (re)emergence of vector-borne diseases.
