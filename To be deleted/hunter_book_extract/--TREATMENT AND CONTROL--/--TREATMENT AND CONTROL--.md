## **TREATMENT AND CONTROL**

The illness is self-limited, but therapy with non-steroidal antiinflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) may benefit joint symptoms. Preventive measures against exposure to malaria vectors—for example, insecticide-treated bed nets and indoor residual insecticides—should also be effective in controlling epidemic ONN. Additionally, vaccine efforts aimed at prevention of chikungunya may provide protection against ONNV infection due to production of cross-reactive antibodies[.10](#page-0-0)

# **36.5** Ross River Virus Disease

*David Harley, Andreas Suhrbier*

#### KEY FEATURES

- • Synonyms include epidemic polyarthritis and Ross River fever.
- • Endemic and epidemic transmission in Australia and Papua New Guinea, with a mean of 4600 cases per annum in Australia (2000–2015).
- • Notable clinical features include peripheral symmetric polyarthralgia or polyarthritis, predominantly involving joints of the appendicular skeleton. The disease usually progressively resolves within 3 to 6 months.
- • Diagnosis is usually made by pathology services using commercially available IgM/IgG enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA).

#### **INTRODUCTION**

Ross River virus (RRV) is a mosquito-borne virus that causes several thousand human cases per year in Australia, with polyarthralgia or polyarthritis being the predominant clinical feature. This singlestranded, positive-sense RNA virus (11.8 kb genome) belongs to the genus *Alphavirus* and the family Togaviridae*.* The virus was first isolated from *Aedes vigilax* mosquitoes trapped beside the Ross River in Queensland [\(Fig. 36.5.1\)](#page-1-0) in 1959[.1](#page--1-0) After a series of outbreaks, the disease was originally called *epidemic polyarthritis*.

#### **EPIDEMIOLOGY**

RRV disease is notifiable to public health authorities in Australia and is the most common arboviral disease in Australia. There has been a mean of 4600 (range 1451–9554) reported cases per year (2000–2015), equating to a mean national incidence of 21.3 (range 7.4–40.2) per 100,000 per annum in the same period (data available via [http://www9.health.gov.au/cda/source/rpt\\_4.cfm](http://www9.health.gov.au/cda/source/rpt_4.cfm)). Disease typically occurs in adults between 25 and 39 years old, with no clear predominance in males or females. Symptomatic infections are rare in children.[1](#page--1-0)

RRV is endemic in Australia and Papua New Guinea. Most cases occur in northern Australia during the wet season (usually December–February) when mosquito numbers are high. In 1979–1980, RRV caused a large epidemic in the South Pacific (see [Fig. 36.5.1](#page-1-0)) where the virus may still be circulating.

### **NATURAL HISTORY, PATHOGENESIS, AND PATHOLOGY**

RRV is transmitted in enzootic cycles with macropods (kangaroos and wallabies) as the natural vertebrate hosts. The virus is transmitted to humans from other vertebrates (and humans during epidemics) by mosquitoes, principally *A. vigilax, A. camptorhynchus,* and *Culex annulorostris*. Enzootic transmission, complex ecology involving multiple hosts and vectors, and different modes of transmission in different biogeographic areas make the disease difficult to model and predict and hence hinder disease control[.3](#page--1-2)

Rheumatic disease is believed to arise from adaptive and innate immune responses directed at RRV antigens and RNA persisting in affected tissues. These responses produce arthritogenic proinflammatory mediators[.4,5](#page--1-3) Joint effusions predominantly contain mononuclear cells, and RRV RNA has been detected in synovial fluids by polymerase chain reaction (PCR). However, joint aspirations and PCR have limited value for diagnosis[.6](#page--1-4) RRV infections can be sub-clinical, with the asymptomatic-to-symptomatic ratio between 1.2:1 and 3.0:1[.1](#page--1-0)

Virus-specific antibodies, probably neutralizing antibodies, are believed to be the principal protective adaptive immune response to RRV[.7](#page--1-5) Naturally acquired immunity appears to be lifelong, with no reports of re-infection.

#### **CLINICAL FEATURES**

The incubation period for RRV is usually 7 to 9 days, with a range of 3 to 21 days. Acute disease typically involves polyarthralgia or polyarthritis (80%–100% of patients), fever (20%–60%), rash (40%–60%, usually maculopapular), and/or myalgia (40%–80%). 1,2,4 The joints most commonly affected are multiple peripheral small joints and the knees, usually with a symmetric pattern (Table 36.5.1). Effusions are often present but are usually small. Other symptoms include fatigue (>50%), headache, photophobia, and lymphadenopathy. 1,2,4 RRV encephalitis cases have been reported; however, causal links to the virus are unsupported.

A popular misconception is that RRV disease symptoms persist for years. However, prospective studies using validated questionnaires illustrated that in patients with RRV disease (and no other diagnoses), symptoms usually progressively resolve over 3 to 6 months with no long-term sequelae.<sup>8,9</sup>

# PATIENT EVALUATION, DIAGNOSIS, AND DIFFERENTIAL DIAGNOSIS

A detailed history is helpful, especially with regard to residence, domestic and international travel, and season. Rapid onset of arthritic symptoms is usual, with pain on movement, tenderness, and slight swelling (which can be hard to detect) the most common signs. Tenderness, swelling, heat, redness, and intolerance to movement or pressure can be extreme. The rash is usually maculopapular, occurs within a few days after the onset of symptoms, and resolves within 5 to 10 days. Rash distribution varies considerably, with the trunk and limbs most affected. The face is less affected and, rarely, the rash may be confined to palms, soles, and/ or digital webs. Lymphadenopathy is frequently present, if sought. Aside from fatigue, constitutional symptoms usually resolve within a week. 1.2.4

Diagnosis is usually made by a primary-care physician aided by a commercial serodiagnostic enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA)-based test (widely available in Australia). Two serologic tests at least 10 to 14 days apart are recommended. Peripheral blood counts are usually normal except for a possible slight neutrophilia. An elevated erythrocyte sedimentation rate

<span id="page-1-1"></span>TABLE 36.5.1 Joint Involvement in Ross River Virus Disease.

The percentage of patients who have arthritis/arthralgia in the indicated joint(s) is shown, with the range reflecting the data obtained from several studies

Data from Harley D, Sleigh A, Ritchie S. Ross River virus transmission, infection, and disease: a cross-disciplinary review. Clin Microbiol Rev 2001;14:909–32, and papers cited therein.

can occur, but decreases within a few weeks. Serum C-reactive protein levels are rarely elevated. If erosive changes are seen in x-rays, alternative diagnoses should be sought.<sup>2,8</sup>

The differential diagnoses at initial disease presentation include related Old World alphaviruses (e.g., chikungunya, Barmah Forest, or Sindbis virus<sup>4</sup>), dengue, and Epstein–Barr virus. Other viral arthritides may also be considered, for example, rubella or parvovirus B19.<sup>2,5</sup> Drug reactions, autoimmune arthritides (e.g., rheumatoid arthritis), and other infectious arthritides may also be among the differential diagnoses. Persistent distinct monoarticular arthritis is inconsistent with RRV disease.<sup>2</sup>
