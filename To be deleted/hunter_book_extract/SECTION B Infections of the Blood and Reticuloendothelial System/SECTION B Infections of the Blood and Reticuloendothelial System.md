*Daniel Ansong, Karl B. Seydel, Terrie E. Taylor*

## KEY FEATURES

- • The clinical presentation of uncomplicated malaria is a non-specific, undifferentiated febrile illness. It is not possible to confirm or exclude the diagnosis of a malaria illness based on clinical presentation alone.
- • Malaria infection in non-immune individuals is a medical emergency.
- • Malaria infection is not synonymous with malaria illness, particularly in malaria-endemic areas where older children and adults have acquired immunity to malaria disease and are commonly found with asymptomatic parasitemias.
- • The diagnosis of malaria infection should be confirmed by visualizing parasites microscopically on a peripheral blood smear, by detecting parasite antigen with a rapid diagnostic test (RDT), or when the technology is available, by polymerase chain reaction (PCR).
- • Patients who are unable to take anti-malarial medication by mouth require parenteral therapy. When possible, decisions regarding the use of anti-malarial medications should be based on parasitologic evidence (blood film or malaria RDT most commonly).

## **INTRODUCTION**

Malaria is an ancient and enduring scourge of humankind. About 3 billion people—nearly half of the world's population—are at risk of malaria infection and illness. In 2016 this resulted in 216 million malaria cases and 445,000 deaths[.1](#page-18-0) Malaria has shaped the human genome; complicated major military campaigns; eluded pharmacologic attacks; adversely affected international economic indicators; and challenged generations of clinicians, scientists, and policy makers.

Malaria is an acute and chronic disease caused by obligate intracellular protozoa of the genus *Plasmodium.* Historically, four species of malaria parasites were considered capable of infecting humans: *Plasmodium falciparum, P. vivax, P. ovale,* and *P. malariae;* however, recently, a fifth—*P. knowlesi*—has been recognized as a significant human pathogen[.2](#page-18-1) The majority (90%) of malaria cases are in sub-Saharan Africa, followed by Southeast Asia (7%), and the Eastern Mediterranean (2%)[.1](#page-18-0) Approximately 4% of the estimated cases globally are caused by *P. vivax,* but if Africa is excluded, the proportion increases to 41%; most of the vivax malaria cases are in Southeast Asia (59%), followed by the Eastern Mediterranean (16%) and Africa (12%)[.1](#page-18-0)

The parasites are transmitted to humans by female *Anopheles* mosquitos. The clinical presentation is highly variable but is generally characterized by an undifferentiated febrile illness with headache, chills and rigors, anemia, and splenomegaly. *P. falciparum* is the species most commonly associated with severe and complicated disease. *P. vivax* is the dominant species found outside of Africa; its distribution (the Middle East, Asia, the Western Pacific, and Central and South America) complements that of *P. ovale* (primarily West Africa). *P. malariae* has a worldwide distribution, generally in isolated pockets, and, to date, *P. knowlesi* is restricted to South and Southeast Asia, primarily in areas harboring macaque monkeys ([Fig. 101.1](#page-1-0)).

In sub-Saharan Africa, nearly all malaria-associated morbidity and mortality are caused by *P. falciparum.* Individuals of all ages remain susceptible to infection, but immunity to severe disease develops over time, the result of repeated exposure to bites from infected anopheline mosquitoes. Non-immune individuals typically, young children in sub-Saharan Africa but also tourists and soldiers traveling in other malaria-endemic areas—are at risk of developing severe and complicated malaria. Semi-immune people can be infected (i.e., parasitemic) but asymptomatic; when semiimmune people do develop a malaria illness, it is generally marked by fever and malaise and rarely becomes life threatening.

Contemporary efforts to address the multiple challenges of malaria control, prevention, and, perhaps, elimination or eradication [\(Box 101.1](#page-1-1)) include using combination chemotherapy exclusively (to slow the development and spread of drug-resistant parasites), attempting to develop a malaria vaccine, and scaling up interventions that are known to be effective (e.g., long-lasting insecticidetreated bed nets, indoor residual spraying of insecticide, and various population-based drug administration programs).

## **EPIDEMIOLOGY**

Malaria control efforts over the past 20 years have resulted in remarkable results, with the rate of malaria mortality dropping 57%.[3](#page-18-2) Declines in mortality as well as parasite prevalence have not been linked to specific interventions, although the use of insecticide-treated bed nets and vector control have been credited for many of the gains. The decreasing disease prevalence brings about a new set of challenges. In some areas, the burden of severe disease has shifted from a young population to an older population as exposure (and thus acquired immunity) has decreased in the younger population[.4](#page-18-3) As disease decreases even further, "hot spots," areas where the extreme disease prevalence heterogeneity results in geographic locations with much higher areas of prevalence and transmission, have emerged. Sustained control efforts, including active detection and treatment of these hot spots, will be important for continued progress in disease control. History has shown that malaria is capable of resurgence; if continued efforts toward control and eradication are not continued, this risk is a possibility.[5](#page-18-4)

As attention turns from disease control to elimination and eradication, more efforts have been directed to defining the transmission reservoir. Symptomatic malaria illnesses are a minority of all infections; thus treatment of only those who present for clinical care will never be sufficient for disease elimination. As the transmission reservoir continues to be explored, a consistent finding in multiple geographic and transmission settings is the important contribution of school-aged children in the maintenance of the transmission reservoir.[6–11](#page-18-5)

## **Transmission**

Malaria is most commonly transmitted during the bite of an infected female *Anopheles* mosquito or, more rarely, can be transmitted through the direct inoculation of infected red blood cells (i.e., congenital malaria, transfusion malaria, and malaria from contaminated needles).

#### <span id="page-1-1"></span>**BOX 101.1** Useful Malaria Vocabulary

- • **Pre-patent period:** The time from inoculation of sporozoites from mosquitoes until asexual erythrocytic-stage parasites are detected by microscopy in the bloodstream. This measure can be influenced by the parasite detection technique (PCR > rapid diagnostic tests > microscopy).
- • **Incubation period:** The time from inoculation of sporozoites from mosquitoes until an individual develops clinical signs or symptoms of malaria—this is always longer than the pre-patent period, but the time difference is determined by immune status. Non-immune individuals develop symptoms with low parasitemias, so the incubation period is shorter than in semi-immune individuals, who may be able to tolerate significant parasitemias without becoming symptomatic.
- • **Recurrence:** Repeat intra-erythrocytic infection causing malaria-associated symptoms.
  - • **Relapse:** A recurrent infection caused by a new brood of blood-stage parasites emerging from hypnozoites in the liver (*P. vivax, P. ovale*).
  - • **Recrudescence:** A recurrent infection caused by the growth of an undetectable blood-stage infection (generally the result of drug resistance, unusual pharmacokinetics, or an incomplete dose). It can also occur in immunocompromised individuals, most famously with *P. malariae.*
  - • **Reinfection:** A recurrent infection caused by new exposure to infective mosquitoes, best differentiated from recrudescence by molecular methods.
- • **Endemicities:** This traditional measure has been based on different indicators over the years and is most useful as a

- general description of the relationship between parasite transmission and malaria disease in a given setting (see [Table](#page-2-0)  [101.1](#page-2-0)).
- • **Stable malaria** is present when natural transmission occurs over many years and there is a predictable incidence of illness and prevalence of infection. Transmission is generally high, and epidemics are unlikely.
- • **Unstable malaria** occurs in settings where transmission rates vary from year to year and population immunity is low. Epidemics are more likely in this setting.
- • **Autochthonous (indigenous) malaria** is contracted locally. Secondary cases are those derived from imported cases and are referred to as **introduced malaria**.
- • **Induced malaria** is acquired by blood transfusion, shared needles, intentional inoculation, or laboratory accident.
- • **Cryptic malaria** cases are those that occur in isolation and are not associated with secondary cases.
- • **Entomologic inoculation rate:** Sporozoite-positive mosquito bites per unit time.
- • **Annual parasite incidence (API):** Number of new parasiteconfirmed cases per 1000 population.
- • **Spleen rate:** Proportion of individuals in a stated age range with enlarged spleens.
- • **Malaria elimination** is the reduction to zero malaria infections in a defined geographic area.
- • **Malaria eradication** is the permanent extinction of malaria transmission.

The degree of endemic malaria is determined by examination of a statistically significant sample of a population and is assessed and classified as in the table.

Vector abundance and longevity are major contributors to transmission rates, and these are strongly influenced by temperature, rainfall, and humidity. The most direct measure of transmission intensity is the entomologic inoculation rate (EIR)—the number of infectious female anopheline bites per person per year (see [Box](#page-1-1) [101.1](#page-1-1)). For clinicians working in settings where data on EIRs are not readily available, surrogate measures include the spleen rate and parasite prevalence rates in children ([Table 101.1](#page-2-0) and [Box 101.1](#page-1-1)).

Malaria transmission is also influenced by climate. The optimal conditions occur when the temperature is between 20°C and 30°C and the mean relative humidity is at least 60%. Water temperatures regulate the duration of the aquatic cycle of the mosquito vector. A high relative humidity increases mosquito longevity and therefore increases the probability that an infected mosquito will survive long enough to become infective.

The proximity of human habitation to breeding sites directly influences vector–human contact and therefore transmission. The stability of breeding sites is influenced by water supply, soil, and vegetation. Irrigation schemes, dams, and other man-made changes affecting land use can radically alter stable patterns of malaria transmission. Additionally, new breeding sites can be introduced into communities when water reservoirs are introduced by humans; open household containers left with standing water are sufficient to serve as a breeding site.

## Transfusion Malaria

Any of the five species of human malaria can be transmitted directly from an infected blood donor, accidental infection by a contaminated needle, or infected intravenous (IV) drug users sharing needles. The incubation period after infection is as short as a few days for *P. falciparum* but can be up to 40 days or longer for *P. malariae*.

## **Acquired Immunity**

The incidence and prevalence of malaria illness is significantly influenced by acquired immunity. The burden of disease and death is borne by those individuals with less exposure and thus minimal immunity, mainly young children. Older children and adults are partially immune due to their repeated infections over time. The age at which this transition from susceptible to resistant to lifethreatening malaria occurs is dependent on the EIR of the location; those areas with higher EIRs result in clinical immunity at an earlier age. Travelers from non-malaria-endemic regions, having never been exposed to malaria, would be comparable to the youngest of children from malaria-endemic regions and are thus susceptible to life-threatening disease. In regions where transmission is unstable, there is little acquired immunity and individuals from any age group can develop severe disease.

## **Innate Immunity**

On a population level, several genetic polymorphisms and mutations conferring risk or protection have been identified. Many, such as sickle cell disorders and the thalassemias, involve mutations in the alpha or beta globin chains of hemoglobin (hemoglobinopathies). Others involve hemoglobin C, red blood cell enzyme deficiencies such as glucose 6-phosphate deficiency (G6PD), or mutations affecting the red cell exoskeleton such as ovalocytosis. Genome-wide association studies have also identified ABO blood group O as being protective against severe malaria[.13](#page-18-7) Recent research revealed the linkage of structural variants in glycophorins, known malaria parasite receptors on the erythrocyte surface, to protection from severe disease.[14](#page-18-8)

## **LIFE CYCLE AND PATHOGENESIS**

## **Life Cycle**

Infection begins when sporozoites in mosquito saliva enter the skin and bloodstream and, within 30 minutes, invade hepatocytes ([Fig. 101.2](#page-3-0)). The duration of the asexual replication phase inside the hepatocytes varies from 11 to 12 days in *P. falciparum, P. vivax,* and *P. ovale,* to 35 days in *P. malariae* [\(Table 101.2](#page-3-1)). The nucleus of the parasite undergoes repeated division, resulting in the formation of thousands of uninucleate merozoites. There is no inflammatory reaction in the surrounding liver tissue, and at this stage, the host is asymptomatic.

In *P. falciparum* and *P. malariae* infections, the liver tissue merozoites rupture the hepatocyte at about the same time, with none remaining in the liver. This can result in as many as 10,000 merozoites released into the bloodstream. In contrast, *P. vivax* and *P. ovale* have two types of exoerythrocytic forms: a primary type develops and ruptures within 6 to 9 days; the secondary type—the hypnozoite—may remain dormant in the liver for weeks, months, or up to 5 years before developing, later causing relapses of erythrocytic infection. The pre-patent period (see [Box 101.1](#page-1-1)) for *P. knowlesi* in humans is 9 to 12 days.[15](#page-18-9)

*P. falciparum* and *P. knowlesi* are capable of invading erythrocytes of any age. *P. vivax* and *P. ovale* preferentially invade younger erythrocytes, whereas *P. malariae* prefer senescent erythrocytes. Serial cycles of asexual replication take place in erythrocytes; the duration varies with the species (see [Table 101.2](#page-3-1)).

The youngest stages found in the bloodstream are small, rounded trophozoites, known as *ring forms.* As they grow, they become more irregular and ameboid. During development, the parasites consume hemoglobin, leaving behind an iron-containing compound known as *hematin* or *hemozoin* as the product of digestion; it is visible in the cytoplasm of the parasite as dark granules. The schizont stage begins when the parasite undergoes nuclear division and culminates in segmentation, when merozoites are formed*.*

Some parasites in the erythrocytic stage undergo gametocytogenesis, producing the sexual forms of the disease: the male microgamete and the female macrogamete. Male and female gametes are ingested by a female anopheline when taking a blood meal from a human host; the sexual replication phase of the malaria parasite ensues in the mosquito mid-gut and ends in the salivary glands (see [Fig. 101.2\)](#page-3-0).

<span id="page-4-0"></span>The life cycle of *P. falciparum* differs from the other four human malaria parasites in one important respect: during the latter half of the intra-erythrocytic cycle, mature falciparum-infected red blood cells are not seen in the peripheral blood. This is due to sequestration—the binding of late-stage parasitized erythrocytes to the luminal surface of vascular endothelial cells. This interaction is mediated by parasite-encoded proteins (primarily PfEMP1) present on the erythrocyte surface, appearing as protuberant knobs. Their irregular shape leads to sequestration of the parasitized red cells in the capillaries and post-capillary venules of various organs, often to such an extent that blood flow is compromise[d16](#page-18-10) ([Fig. 101.3](#page-5-0)).

## **Pathogenesis**

Pathophysiologic changes in malaria are caused by a number of different parasite-derived stimuli involving many different organ systems. Blood-stage parasites are the main source of these various stimuli; exoerythrocytic stages, gametocytes, and sporozoites do not induce pathophysiologic changes. Malaria pathogenesis and pathology are linked inextricably to stages in the life cycle (see [Fig. 101.2](#page-3-0)).

## Fever

Schizont rupture is the likely source of the fevers associated with malaria, although the specific pyrogens have yet to be identified. The fevers are rarely as periodic as the erythrocytic cycles themselves, probably because parasite population dynamics within a host are not synchronous.

## Anemia

Malarial anemia results largely from the hemolysis and splenic clearance of infected red blood cells at the time of schizont rupture, accelerated immune-mediated destruction of uninfected red blood cells, bone marrow suppression, and dyserythropoiesis despite appropriate concentrations of erythropoietin. Severe intravascular hemolysis, also known as *blackwater fever* manifesting as hemoglobinuria, can precipitate acute renal failure.

## Hypoglycemia

Because of its deleterious effects on the central nervous system (CNS), and because of the necessity for treatment with exogenous glucose, hypoglycemia is the most important of the biochemical aberrations.[17](#page-18-11) Antimalarial treatment itself can precipitate hypoglycemia; rapid infusions of quinine (>10 mg/ kg/hr) can stimulate pancreatic insulin secretion, and pregnant women appear to be especially susceptible to this complication of treatment. Hypoglycemia can develop, before any anti-malarial treatment, in up to 20% of children with severe *P. falciparum* malaria. Parasite consumption of glucose and/or inadequate hepatic gluconeogenesis are the most likely etiologies of malaria-induced hypoglycemia.

## Metabolic Acidosis

Acidosis is an important marker of severity in falciparum malaria infections. "Acidotic breathing" alone was associated with a 19% mortality rate in Kenyan childre[n17](#page-18-11) ([Fig. 101.4\)](#page-6-0). Acidosis and hypoglycemia are strongly associated, suggesting parasite and/or host metabolism may be contributing to both. Circulatory shock is rarely a feature of severe and complicated malaria, so grossly impaired perfusion is unlikely to be a cause of the metabolic acidosis of malaria. Acidosis generally improves rapidly once IV treatment with an effective anti-malarial drug and maintenance fluid is started.

## Acute Respiratory Distress

Non-cardiogenic pulmonary edema is a common feature of complicated malaria in adults but only rarely develops in children. The specific cause of this syndrome in malaria patients has yet to be identified[.18](#page-18-12)

## Renal Abnormalities

Non-specific mildly elevated urea nitrogen and creatinine levels, proteinuria, and abnormal urinary sediment are common in adult malaria. Acute renal failure is a common complication of severe malaria, particularly in adults. Most patients do not require long-term dialysis.[19](#page-18-13) Acute kidney injury (AKI) is becoming a more recognized complication of pediatric malaria, with one study finding 50% of children meeting the definition of AKI. Histologically, about 50% of autopsy cases show glomerular thrombi.[20](#page-19-0)

Upper left: (A) Brain with the classic "slate gray" to "purple" appearance of CM, which is possibly due to malaria pigment within vessels. (B) Control-case coronal brain slice appears without discoloration. (C) Classic CM2 appearance; petechial hemorrhages are seen diffusely in the white matter throughout the brain. (D) A higher magnification of (C). (E) In a subset of the CM1 cases, the coronal brain slice appeared very discolored and swollen but without petechial hemorrhages. (F) The cerebellum had petechial hemorrhages visible on the surface grossly. Upper right: (A) The abrupt transition from gray to white matter and the presence of ring hemorrhages are demonstrated in CM (100×, Hematoxylin and eosin (H&E)). (B) The cerebellum with ring hemorrhages in all levels, including white and gray matter, are shown (100×, H&E). (C) Visibly congested blood vessels may be the result of dense sequestration downstream; these vessels can contain both parasitized and uninfected red bloods cells (200×, H&E). (D) The classic appearance of a ring hemorrhage with fibrin is shown; uninfected erythrocytes constituting the surrounding hemorrhage are seen (400×, H&E). (E) Two examples of sequestration showing predominantly early (less pigmented) parasites, and (F) late-stage (more pigmented) parasites densely packing vessels (1000×, H&E). Lower left: Representative images of pathology outside of the brain are shown. The heart (A) was a common site of sequestration (1000×, H&E). The small bowel (B), including jejunum and ileum, as well as the stomach and colon (C), were common sites for sequestration; the most intense sequestration in the gastrointestinal tract was in CM patients (400×, H&E). The subcutaneous adipose layer of the skin (D) was a common site of dense sequestration but was only seen in cases with CM. Lower right: The lungs (A) demonstrate some sequestration of parasites but more frequently have heavily burdened macrophages with variable-size pigment globules (1000×, H&E). Fibrin thrombi (B) were present in a subset of CM2 and other cases in the lungs suggestive of disseminated intravascular coagulation (DIC) (400×, H&E). The spleen (C) demonstrating the unique finding of dense parasite burdens in CM1 spleens (200×, Giemsa). A representative glomerulus (D) from the kidney shows malaria pigment within macrophages and microthrombi present in capillaries (400×, H&E).

imaging studies point to the presence of severely increased brain volume as the main risk factor for death in children with CM.[25](#page-19-1) Possible causes of increased brain volume include vascular congestion from sequestration, cytotoxic or vasogenic edema, or hyperemia.

## **CLINICAL FEATURES**

## **Prodromal Symptoms**

Some patients have vague prodromal symptoms, such as malaise, myalgia, low back pain, headache, anorexia, and mild fever, before parasitemia can be detected by the usual microscopic techniques. These manifestations may persist for 2 to 3 days before an acute paroxysm begins. The incubation period, or time from exposure to onset of symptoms, can be prolonged by partial immunity and/ or by chemoprophylaxis.

## **Periodicity**

In primary attacks, several days are required before the periodicity predicted by the lengths of various parasite life cycles is established. Often, in patients with asynchronous infections, this periodicity is never clinically apparent. After 5 to 7 days, *P. vivax, P. malariae,* and *P. ovale* infections can become synchronous and cause periodic febrile paroxysms. In *P. vivax* and *P. falciparum* malaria, schizonts mature and rupture with tertian periodicity (i.e., every 48 hours); *P. malariae* schizonts rupture at 72-hour intervals, causing a quartan periodicity. The typical paroxysm has an abrupt onset with a feeling of coldness and a chill. Within 30 to 60 minutes, the patient feels hot and has profuse sweating, usually accompanied by a headache, malaise, and myalgia. Temperatures of 40°C to 41°C (104°F–106°F) are usual in *P. falciparum* infections, but peak fevers in infections with the other three species of *Plasmodia* are usually lower (i.e., 39°C–40°C [102°F–104°F]). The hot stage lasts from 2 to 6 hours. The sweating stage, in which the patient's temperature falls rapidly, lasts 2 to 3 hours. The entire paroxysm averages 9 to 10 hours, and between paroxysms, the patient may feel well.

## **Uncomplicated Malaria**

Uncomplicated malaria illness is by far the most common clinical manifestation of a malarial infection, and fever or history of fever is the most common symptom. The differential diagnosis is broad ([Table 101.3\)](#page-7-0). The presence of malaria parasitemia increases the odds of a causal connection, especially in non-immune individuals. Many semi-immune individuals (generally long-term residents of malaria-endemic areas) can harbor parasites without becoming symptomatic, and in these individuals, peripheral blood parasitemia may well be incidental to the symptoms.[21](#page-19-2)

Important aspects of the clinical history include travel itinerary, malaria precautions (chemoprophylaxis, use of bed nets and repellents), and recent prior treatment with anti-malarial drugs. The physical examination is useful for identifying other potential etiologies. In endemic areas, the presence of hepatomegaly or splenomegaly tilt the differential diagnosis toward malaria, as does thrombocytopenia. For non-immune travelers, the presence of fever, splenomegaly, hyperbilirubinemia, and thrombocytopenia make malaria more likely.[22](#page-19-3)

Common presenting signs are generalized constitutional symptoms, including fever, chills, rigors, dizziness, backache, myalgia, malaise, and fatigue (frequently summarized as "total body pain" by endemic-area adults). Gastrointestinal symptoms (i.e., anorexia, nausea, vomiting, abdominal pain, and diarrhea) can be prominent, causing confusion with gastroenteritis. Patients may have non-productive cough and dyspnea, consistent with acute respiratory infections. Young children and semi-immune adults may present with only fever and headache; very young children will present with non-specific clinical features (e.g., poor feeding, irritability, listlessness).

## **Laboratory Findings**

Anemia, leukopenia, and thrombocytopenia are usual. The reticulocyte count is normal or depressed, despite the hemolysis, and becomes elevated usually 5 to 7 days after the parasitemia has cleared. Urinalysis reveals albuminuria and urobilinogen; increased conjugated bilirubin is present in many patients. Some patients are jaundiced, and concomitant abnormalities in liver function tests may cause diagnostic confusion with viral hepatitis. Serum alanine aminotransferase (ALT) and aspartate transaminase (AST) are usually elevated. Both the direct and the indirect bilirubin can be elevated. Prothrombin times can be prolonged. Increases in serum creatinine and blood urea nitrogen may be transient, or they may presage acute renal failure. Hypoglycemia frequently complicates falciparum malaria and can occur both before treatment and as a result of quinine therapy.

The five human malaria parasites have similar clinical presentations for uncomplicated disease and are best distinguished from each other by geography (see [Fig. 101.1\)](#page-1-0), by parasite density (parasitemias >2% are more commonly seen in *P. falciparum* and *P. knowlesi*), and by parasite morphology—best appreciated on thin blood films (see [Table 101.2](#page-3-1)). Low-grade infections of *P. malariae* can persist for years, and individuals with *P. vivax* and *P. ovale* may have pre-patent periods of a year or more.

Non-immune individuals with *P. falciparum* infections may deteriorate very rapidly; prompt and effective treatment in this high-risk group is important and should be provided on an emergent basis. Patients should be monitored closely to detect early signs of clinical deterioration. Serial examination of the peripheral blood (every 12 hours) may aid in the identification of low-density parasitemias; thrombocytopenia is another helpful clue in oligoparasitemic or initially aparasitemic patients.

## **Complicated Malaria**

Long considered to be unique to falciparum malaria, several of the features of complicated malaria [\(Table 101.4\)](#page-8-0) have now been described in patients with *P. vivax* and *P. knowlesi* infections. In addition to the complications described in [Table 101.4](#page-8-0), splenic rupture is a rare complication of *P. vivax* infections, and nephrotic syndrome is occasionally seen in patients after *P. malariae* illness.

In a parasitemic patient, the presence of any of the clinical or laboratory features of complicated (life-threatening) malaria represents a medical emergency (see [Table 101.4\)](#page-8-0); these patients should be provided with the best available medical care.

The clinical presentation of complicated malaria is different in adults than it is in children (see [Table 101.4\)](#page-8-0). Cerebral malaria alone is more characteristic of pediatric severe malaria, whereas multi-organ system involvement is seen frequently in adults with

<span id="page-7-2"></span>Predicted CSF WBC count/µl = CSF RBC count × (peripheral blood WBC count ÷ peripheral blood RBC count).

complicated malaria illnesses. In clinical trials, mortality rates in adults with severe malaria ranged from 15% to 22%, and those in children ranged from 8.5% to 10.9%.[23,24](#page-19-4)

Important elements of the physical examination include inspection for prostration (the inability to sit unaided or, in infants who cannot yet sit, to feed) and deep breathing, assessing the Blantyr[e25](#page-19-1) or Glasgow Coma Score ([Table 101.5\)](#page-8-1), inspecting nail beds and conjunctivae for pallor, cardiac and pulmonary auscultation for signs of high-output cardiac failure, measuring blood pressure and checking capillary refill, and palpating the abdomen to identify hepatomegaly and splenomegaly or urinary retention. Decreased urinary output suggests acute renal failure and can be confirmed by measures of serum creatinine.

## **Cerebral Malaria**

Cerebral malaria is a highly variable clinical syndrome consisting of *P. falciparum* parasitemia of any density and coma (Blantyre Coma Score ≤2 in children/Glasgow Coma Score ≤9 in adults, unrelated to hypoglycemia, meningitis, a postictal state, or any other cause of encephalopathy). Children with CM frequently demonstrate symptoms suggesting widespread involvement of the CNS, including generalized tonic-clonic convulsions, focal seizures,

<span id="page-8-0"></span>**TABLE 101.4** Features of Complicated Malaria **Physical Findings Laboratory Investigations** • Impaired consciousness/ unrousable coma (Blantyre Coma Score ≤2) (children > adults) • Prostration (unable to walk or sit up) • Failure to feed • Convulsions (more than 2 in 24 h) (children > adults) • Acidotic breathing (children > adults) • Shock (systolic blood pressure <70 mmHg in adults, <50 mmHg in children) • Clinical jaundice + evidence of another organ dysfunction (adults > children) • Abnormal spontaneous bleeding • Pulmonary edema (radiologic evidence) (adults > children) • Hypoglycemia (<2.2 mmol/L or 40 mg/dL) (children > adults) • Metabolic acidosis (plasma bicarbonate <15 mmol/L) (children > adults) • Severe anemia (hemoglobin <5 g/dL, PCV <15%) (children > adults) • Hemoglobinuria • Hyperparasitemia (>2%, or 100,000/µl in low transmission setting, >5%, or 250,000/µl in high-transmission settings) • Hyperlactatemia (>5 mmol/L) • Renal impairment (creatinine >265 µmol/L) (adults > children) *PCV*, Packed cell volume.

posturing (opisthotonos ([Fig. 101.5A\)](#page-9-0), decerebrate or decorticate rigidity), conjugate gaze deviations, and respiratory rhythm abnormalities (including Cheyne–Stokes respirations). Intracranial pressure is often elevated in children with cerebral malaria, and deaths consistent with various herniation syndromes have been described.[26](#page-19-5) Among patients who survive, the recovery is relatively rapid; most children who survive an episode of CM have regained full consciousness within 48 hours.

Among patients meeting the standard clinical case definition of cerebral malaria[,27](#page-19-6) a careful ocular funduscopic examination ([Fig. 101.5B](#page-9-0)) is very useful for distinguishing patients more likely to have CM from those more likely to have a non-malarial cause of coma [\(Fig. 101.6\)](#page-9-1).

## **Post-Malaria Neurologic Syndrome**

This is a rare transient neurologic syndrome, reported in nonimmune travelers after a successfully treated episode of severe falciparum malaria. The onset is generally within 1 to 2 weeks of recovery but can be as long as 2 months after. The clinical features range from confusion and tremors to aphasia, seizures, ataxia, psychosis, and impaired consciousness. There may be a lymphocytic pleocytosis in the cerebrospinal fluid (CSF); imaging studies may show non-specific white matter changes. The symptoms are generally self-limiting; steroids have been used with good results in some patients[.28](#page-19-7)

# **Metabolic Acidosis**

Capillary blood pH <7.3, plasma bicarbonate <15 mmol/L, or plasma lactate concentrations >5 mmol/L are all associated with severe disease and with poor outcomes. Acidosis, manifested clinically as abnormally deep breathing, is a poor prognostic feature in parasitemic children with or without neurologic compromise.

## **Severe Anemia**

Life-threatening anemia can develop rapidly; children who have adjusted to a low hemoglobin or hematocrit can rapidly decompensate when challenged by malaria. Decisions regarding blood transfusion are difficult, particularly in malaria-endemic areas where HIV infection is common. Decisions to transfuse are generally made based on hemodynamic grounds (signs of highoutput heart failure include hypotension, poor capillary refill, systolic murmurs, and hepatosplenomegaly), level of consciousness, and evidence of acidosis. Estimates of parasite density are helpful in predicting the need for blood transfusion (see ["Treatment](#page-11-0)" section later). Anemic children who are clinically stable may be treated conservatively, but close observation is recommended.

## <span id="page-9-1"></span>**Respiratory Failure**

Respiratory failure associated with acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) can develop rapidly; clinically it is indistinguishable from the ARDS that develops because of other causes. Patients become hypoxemic and may require mechanically assisted ventilation.

## **Algid Malaria**

The majority of patients with severe malaria remain well perfused, but a small proportion develop algid malaria—defined as low blood pressure, cold and clammy extremities, hypoglycemia, and acidosis. In most cases, this represents septic shock, and bacterial pathogens can be identified by blood culture. The judicious administration of antibiotics, fluids, and inotropes is recommended in this setting[.29](#page-19-8) The sudden onset of hypotension in a patient with vivax malaria should prompt consideration of splenic rupture or subcapsular bleeding.

## **Acute Kidney Injury**

Mild proteinuria, azotemia, and oliguria occur frequently in otherwise uncomplicated *P. falciparum* infections. Acute renal failure is far more common among adults than among children; it is also more common in patients with hemoglobinuria ("blackwater fever")[.30](#page-19-9) Acute renal failure can result from acute tubular necrosis, a sequelae of reduced renal perfusion, or from the downstream effects of intravascular hemolysis, which results in increased concentrations of cell-free hemoglobin[.31](#page-19-10) Anuria is a poor prognostic sign, and hemoperfusion or renal or peritoneal dialysis is often necessary. Many renal abnormalities are reversible, and patients appropriately supported through the critical period often enjoy a full recovery.[32](#page-19-11)

## **Malaria in Pregnancy**

In general, pregnant woman are more susceptible to malaria infection than their non-pregnant counterparts; this is most noticeable in areas of low transmission, where few adults have acquired immunity. Susceptibility to infection decreases with each succeeding pregnancy.

The placenta provides a new site for *P. falicparum* sequestration; semi-immune women are less likely to have placental sequestration, and the placentae of multigravidae are less likely to contain evidence of parasite sequestration than those of primigravidae. The receptor on the syncytiotrophoblast lining the intervillous spaces of the placenta is chondroitin sulfate A, and binding is mediated by a specific variant surface antigen, var2csa[.33](#page-19-12)

Clinical manifestations in the mother are determined by the extent of acquired immunity. In sub-Saharan Africa, mild febrile illnesses and anemia are the most common features. In non-immune pregnant women, severe and complicated malaria, often characterized by hypoglycemia and pulmonary edema, can occur. Pregnancyinduced immune suppression generally results in more severe disease, especially in the group at highest risk: primigravid, non-immune women. Parasitemia rates are at their highest during the second trimester, and the period of increased risk can extend into the postpartum period for 1 to 2 months.[33](#page-19-12)

Adverse maternal and perinatal outcomes of malaria in pregnancy include anemia, miscarriage, fetal growth restriction, low birth weight, preterm births, and congenital infection.

## **DIAGNOSTIC EVALUATION AND DIFFERENTIAL DIAGNOSIS**

At the individual patient level, accurate diagnosis and treatment of uncomplicated malaria enhances the chances of a prompt cure and minimizes the likelihood of disease progression. At the population level, the appropriate management of large numbers of patients with uncomplicated malaria will decrease the incidence of severe and complicated malaria and will diminish the reservoir of infected individuals while slowing the development and spread of drugresistant parasites.

To minimize the unnecessary or inappropriate use of antimalarial drugs, parasitologic confirmation of clinically suspected cases is recommended by the World Health Organization (WHO).[34](#page-19-13) Malaria parasites can be identified in a sample of peripheral blood via light microscopy or by using rapid diagnostic tests (RDTs), which are based on the detection of parasite enzymes or antigens. When it is performed well, light microscopy is sensitive and specific and allows for the recognition of various malaria parasite species and estimation of parasitemia. The "gold standard" approach uses Giemsa stain and oil-immersion microscopy.

In resource-constrained endemic areas, when parasitologic diagnoses are not available, algorithms devised on the basis of the prevalence of parasitemia in various age group[s35](#page-19-14) help to balance the risk of undertreating those at risk of progressing to severe disease against the risks of unnecessary drug use, excessive costs, and drug pressure, which could accelerate the development of drug-resistant parasites.

## **Blood Films**

For detecting parasites, a thick blood film is superior, as it concentrates the red cells by a factor of 20 to 40. Identifying species on thick films may be difficult because the red cells have lysed and the morphologic features of the parasites have been altered. Species identifications are made more easily using thin blood films (see [Table 101.6\)](#page-10-0). Thick and thin films can be prepared on the same slide, although they are processed differently (thin films must be fixed in methanol before they are stained). Blood can be stained with Giemsa, Leishman, Field, or Wright's stains. The golden-brown malaria pigment (hemozoin) in monocytes or leukocytes suggests a current or recent malaria infection. Parasites can be counted as a percentage of red cells on a thin film or against white blood cells on a thick film, and if the total red cell or white cell counts are known, the parasite densities can be calculated. Quantifying parasitemia is useful for predicting whether the illness is likely to be caused by malaria, for anticipating the need for blood transfusion, and for following response to anti-malarial treatment.

## **Rapid Diagnostic Tests**

RDTs are antigen-based dipstick, cassette, or card tests in which a colored line indicates that plasmodial antigens have been detected. They are relatively simple to perform and interpret, and they do not require electricity, but not all tests can distinguish between species, some cannot distinguish new infections from recently and effectively treated infections, and none indicate parasite density ([Table 101.6\)](#page-10-0). The choice of a specific RDT depends on its intended use. For example, does it need to distinguish between a recent malaria infection and a current infection? Should it be able to distinguish between falciparum and non-falciparum species? Will treatment decisions be based on the results, or is it being employed for epidemiologic purposes? The choice of which malaria RDT to use in a given situation is complex and depends on availability, cost, quality of the test, and performance characteristics. The WHO sponsors independent RDT product testing performed at the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC). Summary results of the most recent round are available online[.36](#page-19-15)

## Interpreting the Results of Malaria Diagnostic Tests

In semi-immune individuals, asymptomatic or "incidental" parasitemia is common, and the presence of peripheral parasitemia can be misleading. In these individuals, it would be prudent to consider other etiologies for the symptoms, particularly in patients with lower-density parasitemias (see [Table 101.3\)](#page-7-0). Antimalarial treatment is warranted if parasites are detected, but additional treatment may also be required.

Another dilemma is the febrile individual with a *negative* malaria test after exposure in an endemic region. Withholding anti-malarial drugs in situations where malarial infection is a real possibility is difficult for clinicians. The dangers of missing a malaria diagnosis and thus delaying treatment are well known. This apprehension, accompanied by skepticism regarding the reliability of the parasitologic diagnosis (especially via microscopy), is used to justify a "better safe than sorry" approach to the use of anti-malarial drugs. In malaria-endemic areas, patients themselves, along with parents and other caregivers, have come to expect malaria chemotherapy for many febrile illnesses. Clinical evidence for other non-malaria diagnoses should be sought (see [Table 101.3](#page-7-0)) to support the decision to withhold anti-malarials in patients who are not infected with *Plasmodia.*

Experience since the widespread introduction of malaria RDTs in 2010 suggests that increased use is associated with significantly lower use of anti-malarial drugs overall[.37](#page-19-16) In non-immune patients at risk for malaria infection, several parasitologic assessments carried out at 12-hour intervals during a 36- to 48-hour period are recommended before concluding that the individual is free of infection. Intra-erythrocytic *P. falciparum* parasites are typically in circulation for the first 24 to 36 hours of the 48-hour life cycle, and the intra-erythrocytic parasites for the other four infecting species are always present in the peripheral blood, so it is not necessary to "time" blood collections to any particular symptoms (e.g., fever, rigor, diaphoresis).

## **Diagnosing** *P. ovale*

There tend to be lower initial parasitemias (<500 parasites per µl) with *P. ovale* malaria, which lowers the sensitivity of microscopy. *P. ovale* and *P. vivax* can be difficult to distinguish morphologically by oil immersion microscopy. Mixed infections, especially in endemic areas, are common. The diagnosis can be commonly delayed or mixed, especially in travelers, because the clinical features are non-specific and the available diagnostic tools lack sensitivity.

*P. ovale* can be divided into at least two types—classic and variant—which do not differ morphologically[.38](#page-19-17) Variant *P. ovale* is associated with a higher parasite density in humans. Molecular diagnosis and differentiation of the two subspecies can be accomplished with polymerase chain reaction (PCR) protocols in reference laboratories[,39](#page-19-18) but the identifying genetic polymorphisms of the two subspecies require appropriate protocols[.40](#page-19-19)

RDTs have not been developed to detect *P. ovale,* and the performance of currently available RDTs varies greatly in their capability to detect *P. ovale* parasites. Sensitivity varies between 0% and 80%, with parasite density a key factor[.41–44](#page-19-20) A negative RDT test result cannot exclude the diagnosis of *P. ovale* malaria.

## **Complicated Malaria**

Parasitemic individuals with any of the clinical or laboratory features described in [Table 101.4](#page-8-0) are likely to have complicated malaria, but the possibility of a "false-positive" assessment should be considered, particularly (but not exclusively) in the semi-immune population. The mortality rate of untreated severe malaria is probably over 75%; with good management, the mortality rate of CM is roughly 15% to 20%.

Concomitant meningitis can be excluded via lumbar puncture in this setting[45](#page-19-21); if a lumbar puncture is contraindicated on clinical grounds, the patient should be provided with the appropriate antibiotic coverage (penicillin + gentamicin, or ceftriaxone).

Coinfections with bacteria are common and should be sought using blood culture when the capacity exists.[46,47](#page-19-22) Septic shock should be considered in the differential diagnosis and empiric antibiotic therapy administered if there are signs of acidosis or impaired perfusion.

An autopsy series demonstrated that the standard clinical case definition of CM was incorrect in approximately 25% of pediatric cases—non-malarial causes of death were identified. In contrast, 75% of cases in this series did have cerebral sequestration of parasitized erythrocytes and no other causes of death were identified at autopsy[.48](#page-19-23) The best clinical indicator of "true" CM was the presence of at least one of the three features of malarial retinopathy: vessel color changes, macular or extra-macular whitening, and white-centered hemorrhage[s49](#page-19-24) [\(Fig. 101.7\)](#page-12-0). With autopsy findings as the gold standard, the specificity of retinal findings is 93%, the sensitivity is 97%, and the positive and negative predictive values are 97% and 93%, respectively. Malarial retinopathy is best appreciated in eyes that have been fully dilated with mydriatics and examined with a hand-held direct ophthalmoscope (which provides magnification) and an indirect ophthalmoscope (which provides a three-dimensional perspective, as well as a wider field of view). Ninety percent of retinopathy-positive patients can be identified based on observations of the optic disc, the macula, and the area in between[.50](#page-19-25)

Pneumonia may be suspected based on the history and physical examination, and should be considered when oxygen saturation is <90%. Given the frequency of this particular co-morbidity, empiric antibiotic therapy based on the clinical assessment is reasonable.[51](#page-19-26)

## <span id="page-11-0"></span>**TREATMENT**

## **Artemisinin-Based Therapies**

In addition to confirming all malaria cases before treatment, the WHO has set a goal of treating all malaria cases with combination therapy rather than monotherapy[.34](#page-19-13) Artemisinin-based combination therapies (ACTs) are the first-line treatment for all malarial infections. These regimens couple the extremely rapid clearance of parasitemia with short-half-life artemisinin derivatives (10,000-fold reduction in 48 hours) to partner drugs with longer half-lives. The partner drugs have different mechanisms of action; therefore resistance to both modes of action would need to be present in a single infection to permit parasite survival, providing a barrier to the development of drug resistance.

## **Uncomplicated Falciparum Malaria**

Five oral ACTs are recommended for the treatment of uncomplicated malaria, all with comparable efficacy ([Table 101.7](#page-13-0)). All combinations require a 3-day treatment course, and care should be given to ensure adherence with the entire regimen.

In areas of low transmission, a single dose (0.25 mg/kg) of primaquine is also recommended for patients with parasitologically confirmed *P. falciparum.* The addition of this gametocytocidal agent helps reduce transmission. Although primaquine can cause hemolysis, this low dose has been shown to be safe even in persons with G6PD deficiency and thus screening is not needed before therapy. Exceptions to this recommendation include pregnant women, infants <6 months, and breastfeeding mothers with infants <6 months.

Chloroquine is recommended for the blood-stage infections of *P. malariae, P. ovale,* and most *P. vivax* infections. Chloroquineresistant vivax malaria has been reported from Indonesia and Papua New Guinea, and those infections should be treated with ACTs,

Vessel occlusion is widespread on the border of areas of non-perfusion (resulting in "pruning," *yellow arrow*). "Ghost vessels" can be seen (*green arrow*); these are non-perfused vessels, the contents of which are blocking the background choroidal fluorescence.

atovaquone–proguanil, mefloquine, or quinine followed by doxycycline or tetracycline.

A second drug is required for radical cures of the liver-stage parasites in *P. vivax* and *P. ovale.* Patients should be screened for G6PD deficiency before the administration of either tafenoquine (300 mg single dose) or primaquine (0.25–0.5 mg/kg daily for 2 weeks). In settings where laboratory testing is not available, it is acceptable to give a test dose of primaquine or tafenoquine followed by careful clinical observation and monitoring for associated hematologic effects. The half-life of tafenoquine (15 days) is too long to risk a test dose.

## **Severe Malaria**

Patients with severe malaria should receive parenteral anti-malarials for at least 24 hours; after that, a full course of an ACT drug can be administered, beginning as soon as the patient can swallow ([Table 101.8\)](#page-15-0). The two parenteral drug options are contemporary formulations of traditional, plant-based remedies. Quinine (and its stereoisomer, quinidine) comes from the bark of the cinchona tree, and the artemisinins are derived from *Artemesia annua,* known as *sweet wormwood*.

The artemisinin-based compounds have recently replaced the cinchona alkaloids as the preferred treatment of severe malaria (see [Table 101.8\)](#page-15-0). Randomized clinical trials comparing IV quinine with IV artesunate have established the superiority of artesunate in adults and children.[23,24](#page-19-4) IV artesunate is the first-line treatment for complicated malaria, with intramuscular (IM) artemether being second line. Parenteral quinine should be administered only in the absence of an artemisinin-based compound. In settings where a complete treatment regimen for severe malaria is not available, patients should receive an IM dose of artesunate, artemether, or quinine before transfer to a higher level of care. If IM injections are not available, children should receive a single dose of rectal artesunate before immediate transfer to a health care setting where the treatment regimen can be completed[.34,52](#page-19-13)

## **Post-Artesunate Delayed Hemolysis**

The phenomenon of post-artesunate delayed hemolysis (PADH) has been reported in the wake of increased use of artemisinin-based anti-malarial treatment[.53](#page-19-27) Hemolysis starting more than 1 week after treatment is related to the level of the previous parasitemia. The current working case definition is based on 10% decrement in hemoglobin associated with haptoglobin <0.1 g/L and either an increase in lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) to >390 IL/L or a 10% rise >7 days after the treatment initiation with artesunate. The lifesaving benefits of artesunate outweigh this potential complication, but vigilance, especially for hyperparasitemic patients, is recommended[.54](#page-19-28)

## **Pregnant Patients**

There are very few data on the safety of the artemisinin drugs during pregnancy; in general, they are not recommended during the first trimester. The recommended treatment for uncomplicated malaria during the first trimester of pregnancy is a 7-day course of quinine plus clindamycin. The documented benefits of parenteral artesunate for severe malaria outweigh any possible fetal toxicity,

and it is therefore the recommended treatment of choice during all stages of pregnancy.

There is substantial experience with artemisinin-based drugs during the second and third trimesters of pregnancy, and the standard ACT therapy can be used; artemether–lumefantrine has the safest drug profile in addition to the widest historical use.

Due to known toxicity, primaquine and tafenoquine should not be used during pregnancy. For transmission reduction or for radical cure of *P. vivax* or *P. ovale* infection, chloroquine should be given weekly until after the pregnancy and cessation of breastfeeding, when primaquine or tafenoquine can be safely administered.

## **Non-Falciparum Malaria**

*IM*, Intramuscular; *IV*, intravenous.

All four of the non-falciparum malaria species are susceptible to ACTs. In many regions, they also remain susceptible to chloroquine, with the exception of *P. vivax,* which has developed resistance to chloroquine in some regions. Depending on geographic location and the drug susceptibility, first-line treatment should be either ACT or chloroquine. Patients in the first trimester of pregnancy should be treated with quinine. Primaquine and tafenoquine are contraindicated in pregnancy because of the unknown (and unknowable) G6PD status of the fetus.

## *P. vivax*

Chloroquine is the recommended treatment for chloroquine-sensitive blood stages of *P. vivax*. [55](#page-19-29) The standard chloroquine total dose of 25 mg/kg, in three daily doses, clears sensitive vivax parasites within 48 hours. Radical cures can be accomplished by the combination of chloroquine and primaquine or tafenoquine, hypnozoitocidal drugs.

Chloroquine-resistant vivax malaria, first described in travelers visiting Papua New Guinea, exists in all three endemic continents.[56,57](#page-19-30) Artemisinin-combination based treatment is safe and effective for individuals infected with *P. vivax* and offers an opportunity for a unified policy for treatment of both falciparum and vivax infections. A number of countries have adopted ACTs as first-line treatment for vivax, given in conjunction with a single dose of tafenoquine, or followed by 14 days of primaquine[.34](#page-19-13) Artesunate is recommended for the treatment of severe vivax malaria, as it is for severe falciparum malaria.

## *P. ovale*

*P. ovale* is considered a relapsing malaria.[58](#page-19-31) However, the relapse frequency and relapse interval of *P. ovale* are poorly described. Recently the existence of a true hypnozoite in *P. ovale* malaria has been questioned.[59](#page-19-32) If true hypnozoites exist, then the relapse frequency must be very low.

Chloroquine at 25 mg/kg divided over 3 days is the treatment of choice if a mono-infection with *P. ovale* is confirmed. ACTs are effective and could be used. Currently, a radical cure of a single dose of tafenoquine (300 mg) or 30 mg primaquine base (0.5 mg/kg) by mouth daily for 14 days is recommended to eliminate hypnozoites; however, note the controversy in this regard mentioned earlier. Use of lower-dose primaquine has been associated with therapeutic failures and recurrent *P. ovale* malaria.[60](#page-19-33)

## *P. malariae*

The treatment of choice for the typical, uncomplicated febrile illness associated with *P. malariae* mono-infection is chloroquine at 25 mg/kg total dose divided over 3 days. ACTs, as well as other anti-malarial drugs, are effective and could be used in settings of diagnostic uncertainty.

Clinicians should be aware of the possibility of occasional recurrent parasitemias with clinical symptoms after treatment with a standard course of chloroquine.[61](#page-19-34) These cases likely represent delayed parasite clearance rather than true resistance. There is a 16- to 59-day range in the length of the pre-patent period in experimental mosquito-transmitted *P. malariae*, [62](#page-19-35) and it is thought that some parasites could emerge from the liver days or weeks after treatment is initiated when drug levels are inadequate to prevent parasitemia.[63](#page-19-36) On such occasions, either re-treatment with a full treatment course of chloroquine or another standard anti-malarial treatment regimen would be satisfactory.

## *P. knowlesi*

This parasite has been subjected to less drug pressure than other malaria parasites and is fully susceptible to a broad range of anti-malarial drugs administered according to standard oral and parenteral regimens (chloroquine, quinine, artemether–lumefantrine, artesunat[e64–67](#page-19-37)). Primaquine has been used as presumptive anti-relapse treatment, but there is no evidence of a hypnozoite stage, so it may not be necessary[.67](#page-19-38)

## **Supportive Care**

Dedicated nursing care is important in the management of patients with severe malaria. Vital signs, urine output, and an updated coma score should be monitored as frequently as possible. The most common causes of a decrease in coma score after the initiation of therapy are seizures, hypoglycemia, and anemia. Blood glucose, lactate, parasitemia, and hemoglobin/hematocrit can be monitored every 4 to 6 hours on finger-prick samples of blood. Patients not on ventilatory support should be positioned in the lateral decubitus position to minimize the chance of aspiration. IV fluids containing 5% dextrose are important initially, but nasogastric tube feeding can be started within 18 to 24 hours of admission if the patient is unable to eat.

## **Fever**

There is no consensus on how best to treat malarial fevers. Aggressive fever management may decrease the risk of seizures and subsequent neurologic damage. In vitro data, however, are mixed as to the effect of temperature on the physiology of infected erythrocytes. One study shows that parasite sequestration is less effective at higher temperatures, whereas another shows increased binding of uninfected erythrocytes to infected erythrocytes[.68,69](#page-19-39) Acetaminophen (paracetamol) and ibuprofen are both effective anti-pyretics in malaria patients, although the risk of gastrointestinal bleeding has tempered enthusiasm for the extended use of ibuprofen.

## **Seizures**

Seizures are a very common complication of severe malaria illnesses—the coma of CM is frequently ushered in with a convulsion. Febrile convulsions are distinguished by a rapid recovery of consciousness. Multiple fits are common, as are sub-clinical seizures, which can be detected in nearly 20% of children with cerebral malaria[.70](#page-19-40) In practice, decisions regarding the use of anti-epileptic drugs are made on the basis of a detailed neurologic examination and assessment of the respiratory rate and rhythm (shallow, irregular respirations may be a seizure equivalent). Occasionally, seizures emerge when hypoglycemia is corrected. Standard anti-convulsant protocols are difficult to develop because of the heterogeneity of the patient population, but commonly used drugs include the benzodiazepines (IV, per rectum [PR], or sublingual), paraldehyde (IM), phenobarbital (IV), and phenytoin (IV). There is little experience with levetiracetam in malaria to date, but it may prove to be useful.

## **Anemia**

The evidence base for treating malarial anemia is scant and there is no convincing evidence to support the practice of exchange transfusion. Standardized transfusion triggers are difficult to develop because the rate at which an anemia develops is as important as the absolute value of the hemoglobin concentration. In practice, transfusions begin to be considered when the hemoglobin drops below 5 gm/dL (packed cell volume [PCV] = 15%). Clinical clues include signs of hemodynamic instability and cerebral hypoperfusion. The transfusion decision takes into account the peripheral parasitemia and hemoglobin concentration (or hematocrit): the higher the parasitemia, the lower the hemoglobin or hematocrit is likely to drop. Once a decision is made to transfuse, the usual practice is to transfuse screened whole blood (20 mL/kg) or packed cells (10 mL/kg), irrespective of the degree of the anemia or the intensity of the parasitemia, noting that about 5% of pediatric patients require a second transfusion.

## **Hypoglycemia**

Patients with severe malaria can develop hypoglycemia if quinine is infused too rapidly; when it develops as part of the disease process, it is a poor prognostic feature. If hypoglycemia is identified (<3 mmol/L in children under 5, <2.2 mmol/L in patients >5 years of age), the patient should be given 10% dextrose (5 mL/ kg) IV, and the glucose should be rechecked soon thereafter and then every 6 hours until the patient regains consciousness.[34](#page-19-13)

## **Acidosis**

Acidosis in severe malaria is manifested as deep, Kussmaul-like respiration[s29](#page-19-8) and can occur with or without associated hyperlactatemia. It is frequently a sign of hypovolemia[.71](#page-20-5) A trial in children with febrile illnesses (57% had malaria) and compensated shock compared bolus therapy (normal saline and albumin) with conservative management with no boluses: outcomes were significantly better in those who received no additional fluid bolus[.72](#page-20-6) Blood transfusions are helpful when indicated; when not indicated, cautious fluid repletion, beginning with normal saline (10 mL/ kg) is recommended. Acidosis may be a sign of sepsis; collecting a blood culture and starting empiric antibiotic therapy should be considered.[29](#page-19-8)

# **Pulmonary Edema/ARDS**

This complication is more common in adults and can develop several days after admission and the initiation of anti-malarial treatment. Prompt intubation and assisted ventilation are the only recognized treatments[.72](#page-20-6)

## **Renal Failure**

This complication is also more common in adults with severe malaria than in children. Untreated, the mortality rate is over 70%. Patients should receive adequate renal replacement therapy; hemofiltration is superior to peritoneal dialysis in terms of mortality and cost-effectiveness[.73](#page-20-7)

## **Adjuvant Therapies**

Many trials of adjuvant therapies targeting putative pathogenic processes have been conducted. Only a few, even when subjected to meta-analysis, have been adequately powered, and none has demonstrated a positive impact on outcome.

## **Prevention**

## Intermittent Preventive Treatment During Pregnancy

For pregnant women living in malaria-endemic areas, intermittent preventive treatment during pregnancy (IPTp) with sulfadoxine– pyrimethamine (SP) is recommended, despite the increasing resistance to this drug across Africa[.34](#page-19-13) Treatment should start during the second trimester and be provided at regular intervals, with a goal of at least three doses during the pregnancy. Evidence is strongest for a benefit of IPTp during a woman's first and second pregnancy.

## Intermittent Preventive Treatment in Infants

In areas of medium to high malaria transmission, intermittent preventive treatment in infants (IPTi) with SP is recommended to coincide with scheduled vaccine visits through the Expanded Program on Immunizations, but only in settings where parasite resistance, determined by prevalence of the Pfdhps 540, mutation, is ≤50%.[34](#page-19-13) A full dose of SP given with the second and third doses

of the diphtheria, tetanus, and pertussis vaccines has been shown to decrease clinical malaria in the first year of life by 30% and all-cause hospital admissions by 22%[.74](#page-20-8) HIV-exposed or infected children who are receiving cotrimoxazole prophylaxis should not receive this IPTi therapy.

## Seasonal Malarial Chemoprevention

In settings like the Sahel, where the malaria transmission season is sufficiently short, intermittent therapy with a relatively longacting anti-malarial can be used as prophylaxis in the most susceptible populations, for example, a combination of amodiaquine and SP on a monthly basis (not to exceed 4 months) to children under the age of 6 years[.34](#page-19-13) The long half-life of amodiaquine results in sufficient plasma levels for 1 month. Any breakthrough malaria episodes should be treated with an ACT, as would any malaria case. HIV-exposed or infected children who are receiving cotrimoxazole prophylaxis need not receive seasonal malarial chemoprevention (SMC).

## **Vaccines**

Vaccines have been promoted as the most cost-effective method to combat malaria, and efforts have been underway to develop a malaria vaccine for more than 50 years. The *Plasmodium* parasite has many adaptations to avoid the human immune system, several of which also increase the difficulty of designing an effective vaccine. Although the host is able to develop clinical immunity after multiple exposures and avoid severe disease, sterilizing immunity never develops naturally.

Malaria vaccines can be divided into three categories, based on the life cycle of the antigen targeted: pre-erythrocytic, blood stage, or transmission blocking. Several vaccines in each category are in the development phase.

## Pre-Erythrocytic Vaccines

Pre-erythrocytic vaccines target the sporozoite or the liver stage of the life cycle. Proof of principle for immunity against this stage of the parasite was provided more than 50 years ago when the bite of multiple mosquitoes infected with irradiated sporozoites proved to be protective against subsequent challenge[.75](#page-20-9)

Phase I trials are underway in both homologous and heterologous challenge models. These vaccinations still require IV administration, which may limit the scalability to resourcechallenged settings. An alternate approach to irradiation is the genetic manipulation of the sporozoite, which also can limit the development of the sporozoite and may elicit different immune responses.[76,77](#page-20-10)

RTS,S, the malaria vaccine currently furthest along in the developmental pipeline, is a pre-erythrocytic vaccine. It is based on the circumsporozoite (CSP) protein, one of the most abundant proteins on the surface of the sporozoite. The vaccine fuses the central repeat region of CSP with known T-cell epitope regions of the protein and a hepatitis B surface antigen carrier matrix. The vaccine has been in development since the 1980s and was licensed in Europe in 2015. A large phase III trial in Africa showed efficacy in children of 45% at 20 months but waning efficacy over the subsequent 4 years to 28%[.78](#page-20-11)

## Blood-Stage Vaccines

Blood-stage vaccines aim to reduce the clinical severity of malaria disease by targeting the stage of the parasite responsible for symptoms. These vaccines would not prevent the initial liver-stage infection, but if completely effective could abort the infection by effecting the clearance of the erythrocytic phase. This would effectively block transmission, as gametocytes would not have the chance to develop. The two targets pursued to date are AMA-1 and MSP-1. Neither of these vaccine candidates resulted in significant reduction of disease in trials in African children[.79,80](#page-20-12) A third candidate, PfRH3 (an antigen involved in red cell invasion), will be evaluated soon.

## Transmission-Blocking Vaccines

Transmission-blocking vaccines target the malaria antigens present only in the mosquito stages of the parasite life cycle and thus provide no protection for the vaccinated individual. The antibodies generated against these antigens in the human act when the antigens are exposed in the mosquito and block the subsequent development of the parasite. Targets of these vaccines include Pfs25, Pfs45/48, and Pfs230. A challenge to this vaccination strategy is the need for an absolute elimination of the developing parasite. A 90% reduction in oocyte formation still results in viable sporozoites and would allow for ongoing transmission.

## **NON-FALCIPARUM MALARIA**

## *Plasmodium vivax*

In 1890, *P. vivax* was identified as a separate species by Golgi and Feletti[81](#page-20-13); the persistent liver-stage hypnozoite was described in 1982,[82](#page-20-14) and its contribution to clinical relapses of vivax infections in 1985[.83](#page-20-15) Today, *P. vivax* is a major cause of febrile illness in endemic areas of Asia, Central and South America, and the horn of Africa. Ethiopia, India, Indonesia, and Pakistan account for 78% of all *P. vivax* cases.[1](#page-18-0) In general, the Duffy blood group antigen is required for invasion, and because most Africans are Duffy-negative, vivax infections are less common on that continent.[84](#page-20-16) As malaria control and elimination efforts accelerate, two of the challenges posed by *P. vivax* have become more prominent: it cannot yet be cultured in vivo, which limits efforts to develop new drugs and vaccines, and use of the only drugs, available for hypnozoites, primaquine and tafenoquine are, limited by the side effects in individuals with G6PD deficiency.

Long thought to be the "benign" counterpart to falciparum malaria, *P. vivax* is increasingly recognized as a cause of severe disease; it is most spectacularly associated with splenic rupture[,85](#page-20-17) but its frequent use as a treatment for patients with neurosyphilis generated detailed accounts of vivax-induced anemia, renal failure, and respiratory distress, with mortality rates ranging from 5% to 15%[.86](#page-20-18) Because *P. vivax* preferentially invades reticulocytes, parasitemias are lower than in other malaria infections—this increases the challenges associated with using microscopy to identify vivax infections.[86](#page-20-18)

## Clinical Presentation

Uncomplicated vivax malaria, on clinical grounds, resembles uncomplicated falciparum malaria—historically, relapses of vivax malaria have followed outbreaks of falciparum malaria[.81](#page-20-13) The burden of disease falls on young children in endemic areas and on non-immunes of all ages. In areas where *P. falciparum* and *P. vivax* coexist, the peak age for vivax illnesses is younger and immunity is acquired more quickly[.87](#page-20-19) Among hospitalized patients, the odds of dying of vivax malaria are just about two-thirds that of those with severe falciparum malaria.[86](#page-20-18) Population-based risks of death suggest that the risk of dying with *P. vivax* was less than half that associated with *P. falciparum*. [88](#page-20-20)

## *Plasmodium ovale*

*P. ovale* was first described in the blood of a soldier returning from East Africa in 1922.[89](#page-20-21) Although *P. ovale* has been reported from all continents, it is only in tropical Africa and New Guinea that it is relatively common. In West Africa, a blood film *P. ovale* parasite positive rate between 0.7% and 10% has been found[.90](#page-20-22) *P. ovale* is a common cause of morbidity in the endemic communities, with the highest incidence of febrile episodes among children aged 0 to 7 years old, but clinical attacks can be seen in all age groups. *P. ovale* can be seen in up to 15% of returning travelers. *P. ovale* in African immigrants can present months after arrival in a new region.

*P. ovale* causes a relatively mild form of malaria that is very rarely severe (ARDS) or fatal (death caused by splenic rupture reported). Mild hepatomegaly and splenomegaly, thrombocytopenia lower than 100,000/mm3 , elevation in hepatic enzymes (AST/ ALT), and mild hyperbilirubinemia are seen in about 50% of patients. The hemoglobin count tends to be normal.

## *Plasmodium malariae*

*P. malariae* was first described by Golgi in 1886 when he noted the relationship between the 72-hour life cycle of the parasite in the blood of patients and the corresponding appearance of fever and chills (the paroxysm)[.91](#page-20-23) *P. malariae* has been reported from all continents but is only relatively common in tropical Africa and the southwest Pacific. The prevalence of *P. malariae* varies from less than 1% to as high as 30% to 40% in focal areas of West Africa and Indonesia based on standard light microscopy detection. In the endemic communities, *P. malariae* is a common cause of morbidity, with the highest incidence of febrile episodes among children less than 10 years old.

*P. malariae* is unique in that without treatment, blood-stage parasites persist for extremely long periods—likely the lifetime of the host. The persistent, low-density parasitemia in otherwise healthy individuals may produce distinctive clinical features, or individuals may be so asymptomatic that they qualify as blood donors. *P. malariae* causes about 25[%92](#page-20-24) of transfusion-related cases of malaria, although it accounts for only 1% to 2% of imported cases of malaria[.93](#page-20-25) In asymptomatic persons who are immunosuppressed with drug[s94](#page-20-26) or stressed by surgery[,95](#page-20-27) the parasites can recrudesce, and they become symptomatic with typical symptoms of malaria.

The most important and unique feature of prolonged *P. malariae* parasitemia is an irreversible, immune-mediated, nephrotic syndrome[.96,97](#page-20-28) Nephrotic syndrome caused by *P. malariae* can also present outside of malaria-endemic areas years after the last exposure.[98](#page-20-29) Deaths associated with *P. malariae* are from end-stage renal disease[.99](#page-20-30) Renal biopsy is usually required to confirm the diagnosis and properly guide management.[99](#page-20-30) *P. malariae* as the true cause of the nephrotic syndrome may be very difficult to diagnose because the patients may have exceedingly low parasitemias and negative RDT results.

Treating the underlying *P. malariae* in fully established nephrotic syndrome does not improve renal function, as segmental sclerosis and hyalinization of the nephron are irreversible. To prevent end-stage renal disease, *P. malariae* must be considered, diagnosed, and effectively treated as soon as renal symptoms develop.[99](#page-20-30)

## *Plasmodium knowlesi*

*P. knowlesi* is primarily a parasite infecting macaque monkeys. Sporadic human infections were the rule[61](#page-19-34) until a 2004 outbreak of "hyperparasitemic *P. malariae*" in the Kapit Division of Malaysian Borneo. *P. knowlesi* is now established as a common cause of human malaria on the Malay Peninsula in particular, and in Southeast Asia in general, especially in populations living in close proximity to the simian reservoir.[64](#page-19-37)

There is no definitive evidence for cyclical transmission by mosquitoes from human to human; without this evidence, it remains a simian malaria with occasional zoonotic human infections.[100](#page-20-31) Analysis of archival blood films suggests that *P. knowlesi* has infected humans for many years in Malaysian Borneo,[101](#page-20-32) and recent epidemiologic studies suggest that macaque monkeys are the reservoir host[.102](#page-20-33) The recent upsurge in clinical episodes may be related to changes in human exposure to monkeys, deforestation, and a decline in *P. vivax* infections.[103](#page-20-34)

The most common clinical syndrome is a febrile illness, indistinguishable from uncomplicated falciparum malaria, but a small proportion of patients (<10%) progress to severe and complicated disease, in which respiratory distress (ARDS) and renal failure feature more prominently than in severe falciparum malaria[.61,64–67](#page-19-34) Mild malarial retinopathy has been observed in patients with severe and non-severe knowlesi malaria.[104](#page-20-35) *P. knowlesi* is a quotidian parasite, undergoing asexual replication every 24 hours, which may explain the relatively high incidence of severe anemia[.66](#page-19-41) Thrombocytopenia, often profound, is nearly a constant feature in *P. knowlesi* infections, but no clinically evident coagulopathies have been reported[.64–67](#page-19-37) Pediatric *P. knowlesi* infection is restricted to school-age children.[65](#page-19-42)

Microscopically, *P. knowlesi* resembles *P. falciparum* young ring stages and *P. malariae* in the mature trophozoite blood stages; therefore a high index of suspicion and judicious use of molecular methods (i.e., nested PCR) are required to establish the diagnosis definitively.[64,105](#page-19-37)
