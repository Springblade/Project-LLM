*Gregory M. Anstead, John R. Graybill*

# KEY FEATURES

- • Coccidioidomycosis is one of the major endemic mycoses. It occurs primarily in the southwestern United States, Mexico, and Argentina; sporadic cases occur in Central and South America.
- • Infection occurs by inhalation of conidia. Vulnerable patient groups include African Americans, Filipinos, Native Americans, pregnant women in the third trimester, and the immunocompromised.
- • Infection typically manifests as acute or chronic pneumonia, soft tissue lesions or abscesses, meningitis, and osteomyelitis, especially of the spine.
- • Diagnosis is by culture, serologic testing (antibody and antigen detection), PCR, and histopathologic examination.
- • Treatment is with azoles (fluconazole, itraconazole) or amphotericin B and its lipid formulations, depending on disease site and severity.
- • Treatment is prolonged, with responses of 50% to 70%, and relapses occur in up to a third of patients.

#### **INTRODUCTION**

Coccidioidomycosis is caused by dimorphic fungi of the genus *Coccidioides.* It typically presents as acute and chronic pulmonary disease. The infection may disseminate widely, especially to cutaneous, osseous, and central nervous system (CNS) sites. Coccidioidomycosis is a significant health problem in the southwestern United States and Mexico, with about 150,000 infections per year in the United States, 50,000 of which are symptomatic.[1](#page-4-0)

#### **EPIDEMIOLOGY**

Based on molecular genetics, the genus *Coccidioides* has been divided into *C. immitis* (mostly California isolates) and *C. posadasii* (other areas); both species are similarly pathogenic.[2](#page-4-1) The mycelial form of the fungus grows just beneath the soil surface and is composed of arthroconidia intercalated with non-viable segments.

The endemic area is the Lower Sonoran Life Zone, marked by arid or semi-arid climates, sandy soil, and mild winters.[2](#page-4-1) These conditions are found in the southwestern United States (primarily Arizona, California, New Mexico, and Texas), Bolivia, Paraguay, Argentina, and Mexico [\(Fig. 86.1\)](#page-1-0). Cases occur infrequently in Guatemala, Honduras, Nicaragua, Venezuela, Brazil, and Colombia[.3](#page-4-2)

The incidence of coccidioidomycosis is increasing in the United States. In Arizona, the number of cases increased 40-fold in 19 years, from 255 in 1990 (incidence rate 7/100,000 population) to 10,233 cases in 2009 (155/100,000). This increase is due to soil disturbance from construction for Arizona's rising population and an influx of susceptible individuals into the state. Arizona accounts for 60% of all U.S. cases; the highest rates occurred in its most populous counties (Maricopa, Pima, Pinal)[.4](#page-4-3) In Tucson, *Coccidioides* causes 29% of community-acquired pneumonia[.5](#page-4-4)

In California, from 1995 to 2009, annual incidence rates ranged from 1.9 to 8.4 per 100,000, and increased to 13.8 per 100,000 in 2011. In 2016 cases reached an all-time high of 5372 (13.7 per 100,000); 70% of cases occurred in the Central Valley and Central Coast. The reasons for the increased number of cases in 2016 are uncertain, but may be due to a period of rainfall after years of drought and soil disturbance due to construction[.6](#page-4-5)

Risk factors for increased severity of coccidioidomycosis include receiving immunosuppressive medications (corticosteroids, transplant drugs, and tumor necrosis factor–alpha antagonists); pregnancy (especially the third trimester); genetic factors (i.e., defects in the interleukin (IL)-12/interferon-γ axis and STAT3 pathways, certain ABO blood groups, and HLA types); and specific races/ethnicities.[3,7](#page-4-2) The rates of coccidioidomycosis per 100,000 in Arizona in 2009 among different ethnic/racial groups were African American, 67; Asian Pacific Islander, 36; Caucasian, 28; and Hispanic, 21.[8](#page-4-6) Filipinos and Native Americans are considered high-risk groups.[3,9](#page-4-2) Persons with occupations with soil exposure are also at risk for coccidioidomycosis[.9](#page-4-7)

# **NATURAL HISTORY, PATHOGENESIS, AND PATHOLOGY**

When the soil is disturbed, the fragile mycelia disintegrate into a cloud of conidia, which can be carried for miles by the wind. Inhaled conidia are phagocytosed by alveolar macrophages and, over several days, convert into the characteristic large (8–24 µm diameter) spherule ([Fig. 86.2\)](#page-2-0). The spherules elaborate endospores, which multiply, and after 3 to 4 days, hundreds of endospores burst out of the mature spherule. The endospores are ingested by neutrophils, but are not killed. These gradually enlarge into the next generation of spherules[.9](#page-4-7)

Early in the course of infection, *Coccidioides* can hematogenously disseminate to the skin, bones, and CNS. Clinical manifestations of these lesions can appear soon after the acute infection or after many months, sometimes without evidence of the primary infection. Uncontrolled infection often presents as suppurating abscesses, with draining exudates containing abundant neutrophils and spherules, whereas chronic low-grade infection manifests as better-formed granulomas containing few organisms. Both B and T lymphocytes are essential for host defense, indicating that a balanced Th1/Th2 response is necessary for protective immunity.[10](#page-4-8)

#### **CLINICAL FEATURES**

Coccidioidomycosis is asymptomatic in over half of patients. Previously, exposed individuals were detected in earlier years by skin testing, using either coccidioidin (from the mycelia) or spherulin (from the spherule). Skin test surveys have defined the major endemic zones. Skin test reagents became unavailable in the late 1990s, until 2016 when spherulin again became available (Spherusol, Nielsen Biosciences, San Diego, CA).

#### **Primary Infection**

Hypersensitivity reactions may occur with primary infection, including fever, erythema nodosum, erythema multiforme, and arthralgias, known as *Valley fever,* after the San Joaquin Valley of California, a major endemic focus[.2](#page-4-1) These may be the only manifestations of primary coccidioidomycosis, or may blend into the invasive forms of disease.

Hughes JM, Whitley RJ (eds.), *Emerging infections* ed 10. American Society for Microbiology, Washington, DC, 2016.)

# **Pulmonary Infection**

Most symptomatic patients have a transient pulmonary infection occurring 1 to 3 weeks after exposure, manifesting as fever, dry cough, and pleuritic chest pain. This is usually indistinguishable from community-acquired pneumonia.[2,9](#page-4-1) Typically, the symptoms of acute pulmonary coccidioidomycosis resolve spontaneously in less than a month. Alternatively, the pulmonary infiltrates may condense into nodules that resolve or persist asymptomatically. Although primary pneumonia usually resolves, in 5% to 19% of patients, the disease may linger for months, with chronic pulmonary infiltrates, cough, and pleuritic chest pain. Pulmonary infiltrates can cavitate. Cavitary disease can be asymptomatic or cause chronic productive cough and occasional hemoptysis, or rupture into the pleura[.2](#page-4-1) Cavities may also develop secondary bacterial or *Aspergillus* (fungus ball) infection. Small cavities (<5 cm diameter) are more likely to resolve spontaneously than large ones. Chronic pulmonary coccidioidomycosis may follow a waxing and waning course or be slowly progressive over years.[9](#page-4-7) Uncommonly, patients have fulminating pneumonia, with diffuse reticulonodular infiltrates, fever, and hypoxia [\(Fig. 86.3\)](#page-2-1). Aggressive pulmonary disease can occur in pregnancy, especially the last trimester, and in other conditions associated with immunosuppression[.9](#page-4-7)

## **Extrapulmonary Disease**

Disseminated coccidioidomycosis occurs in about 1% of those infected, with a fatal course in one-third of these patients[.7](#page-4-9) Extrapulmonary coccidioidomycosis usually presents as skin lesions (papules, nodules, abscesses, verrucous plaques, ulcers) [\(Fig. 86.4](#page-2-2)), lymphadenitis, deep abscesses, osteoarticular disease (manifested by lytic bone lesions and thickened synovium), or CNS disease, but nearly any organ can be involved.[2,9](#page-4-1)

## **Meningitis and Other CNS Disease**

CNS manifestations include meningitis, encephalitis, mass lesions, and vasculitis.[11](#page-4-10) Coccidioidal meningitis presents as progressive headache, cranial neuropathies, and altered mental status[.2](#page-4-1) Granuloma formation can cause focal neurologic signs. The cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) shows lymphocytosis and hypoglycorrhachia. CSF eosinophilia, if present, is a helpful diagnostic clue, and the CSF is usually positive for IgG antibody. CSF cultures are positive in <50% of cases. Untreated, coccidioidal meningitis is fatal within 2 years[.9](#page-4-7) CNS vasculitis presents as a strokelike syndrome.[11](#page-4-10)

#### **Soft Tissue and Osteoarticular Disease**

Soft tissue involvement in coccidioidomycosis ranges from scattered chronic verrucous granulomatous lesions to suppurating abscesses containing large numbers of spherules. In general, lesions with purulent drainage are associated with a worse prognosis. Coccidioidal osteomyelitis often involves the vertebrae [\(Fig. 86.5](#page-3-0)) and can be associated with compression fractures. Synovitis of large joints is common. *Coccidioides* can be cultured from a synovial specimen more frequently than from joint fluid. Blood cultures can be positive in disseminated disease; this is an indicator of poor prognosis[.9](#page-4-7)

# **COCCIDIOIDOMYCOSIS IN CHILDREN**

Children are susceptible to coccidioidomycosis, with reported incidence of hospitalizations in endemic regions of 8 to 12/100,000. In one series, 56% of hospitalized children had pulmonary disease, 14% had progressive disease, and 7% had meningitis. A third of pediatric patients had co-morbid conditions, usually immunodeficiency or malignancy; none died during their first hospitalization.[12](#page-4-11) Coccidioidal serologic tests are not recommended for the evaluation of infants during the first 3 months of life; positive tests must be interpreted cautiously during the first year. Breastfeeding is not recommended for mothers on azoles other than fluconazole.[13](#page-4-12)

#### **PATIENT EVALUATION AND DIAGNOSIS**

Coccidioidomycosis should be considered in the differential diagnosis of a compatible illness occurring in a resident or visitor to an endemic area. Rapid diagnostic methods are examination of sputum or exudates from purulent lesions for spherules, or detection of spherules on histopathology of cutaneous lesions, bronchoscopy specimens, or lymph nodes. The morphology of *Coccidioides* spherules is nearly pathognomonic[.9](#page-4-7)

The gold-standard technique for the diagnosis of coccidioidomycosis is culture of the organism. The spherules in sputum, exudates, or tissue convert to mycelia, which grow in 7 to 10 days. Fresh tissue samples from *Coccidioides*-infected patients are not directly hazardous, but must be disposed of or rendered non-viable quickly, before the fungus converts to mycelia and produces arthroconidia. Plates with suspected mycelia should be sealed and opened only in biohazard facilities. Careless handling of culture plates has caused coccidioidomycosis in laboratory personnel[.9](#page-4-7)

IgM antibodies develop within weeks after infection but are not sustained. IgG antibodies take 1 to 2 months to appear in blood and CSF and persist for many months. Titers >1:16 correlate with increased severity of illness, and declining titers reflect clinical improvement. However, in practice, these titers change slowly with the patient's improving clinical status. Also, in severe immunodeficiency, antibody titers may be low, or even negative[.2](#page-4-1) A urinary antigen test is available from MiraVista Laboratories (Indianapolis, IN), with 71% sensitivity in moderate to severe disease, versus 87% for culture. There is some crossreactivity with *Histoplasma* antigens[.14](#page-4-13) There is also a commercially available polymerase chain reaction (PCR) test (Mayo Medical Laboratories, Rochester, MN) that can utilize either body fluids or tissue.

# **TREATMENT**

Treatment guidelines were published in 2016.[13](#page-4-12) *Coccidioides* isolates are usually susceptible to amphotericin B and azoles in vitro, but treatment responses are highly dependent on host factors (immunocompetence and race/ethnicity)[.1,2,9](#page-4-0) In a study of the susceptibility of 581 *Coccidioides* isolates, elevated minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) values were observed for 37% of isolates to fluconazole (≥16 g/mL) versus 1% of isolates for itraconazole, posaconazole, and voriconazole. However, studies of the relationship between MIC values and patient outcomes are necessary to determine the relevance of these data in antifungal selection[.15](#page-4-14) Clinical experience with echinocandins is limited.[9,15](#page-4-7)

Treatment courses for any form of coccidioidomycosis are prolonged and should continue months after improvement. Because some lesions can progress while others wane, a scoring system has been developed that incorporates signs and symptoms, cultures, radiographically apparent lesions, and serologic titers. A reduction of a cumulative score to less than 50% of baseline is considered a response to therapy. As cultures are often not repeated (especially if invasive methods are required) and serologic titers change slowly, the total burden of disease has been measured using clinical signs and symptoms and radiographic evaluation of lesion size. In coccidioidal meningitis, normalization of CSF findings indicates treatment response.[9](#page-4-7)

Selection of the antifungal agent depends, in part, on the involved site and the severity of disease[.1,13](#page-4-0) No treatment is recommended for asymptomatic coccidiomas, which are often resected during a search for presumptive lung cancer. The nephrotoxicity of amphotericin B initially discouraged physicians from treating primary coccidioidal pneumonia, which usually resolves spontaneously. However, all patients require observation for at least 2 years to document resolution of infection and to promptly identify complications. Fluconazole has been increasingly used to treat primary coccidioidal pneumonia. Nevertheless, there are no clear data to confirm its efficacy in primary coccidioidal pneumonia or in prevention of dissemination.[13](#page-4-12)

For patients at risk for disseminated disease, antifungal treatment of primary coccidioidal pneumonia is appropriate. Other indications for treatment are severe disease: infiltrates involving both lungs or more than half of one lung, hilar or mediastinal lymphadenopathy, IgG titers >1:16, and highly symptomatic disease (weight loss >10%, night sweats >3 weeks, symptoms >2 months). Patients with signs of chronic pulmonary infection, such as weight loss, night sweats, and multi-lobar infiltrates, and symptoms for more than 2 months should also be treated[.1](#page-4-0)

Based on its excellent tolerability, linear renal clearance, limited drug interactions, and efficacy, fluconazole is the drug of choice for less severely ill patients. In one trial, the response rate in chronic pulmonary and disseminated disease was 50% for fluconazole versus 63% for itraconazole.[16](#page-4-15) Fluconazole doses of 400 mg/day are often used initially, but slow responses and failures in meningitis have led physicians to use doses as high as 1000 to 1200 mg per day[.1,13](#page-4-0) Treatment for 6 months has been suggested for primary pneumonia and longer than 12 months *after* response for severe or chronic pulmonary or disseminated disease.[1](#page-4-0)

Although itraconazole is slightly superior to fluconazole in patients with skeletal disease, its less predictable pharmacokinetics and more frequent adverse events have rendered itraconazole a secondary drug[.9](#page-4-7) Itraconazole is administered orally, either as capsules with a fatty meal or as a solution in the fasted state, at 400 to 600 mg/day. Larger studies have been conducted with capsules, which are better tolerated but less predictably absorbed. Itraconazole inhibits and is metabolized by cytochrome 3A4, so its drug interactions are extensive. There is limited experience with itraconazole in the treatment of meningitis compared with fluconazole.[9](#page-4-7)

For life-threatening coccidioidomycosis, amphotericin B or a lipid formulation is recommended[.1,13](#page-4-0) The latter is preferred because of its modestly decreased risk of nephrotoxicity. There is no evidence that high doses of the lipid formulations (e.g., 10 mg/ kg) are more effective than doses of 3 to 6 mg/kg. Responses to amphotericin therapy of 50% to 70% are seen[.9](#page-4-7) When the patient has improved or when nephrotoxicity occurs, treatment is shifted to azoles for ongoing therapy.[1,13](#page-4-0)

Because the azoles may be teratogenic, amphotericin B is preferred during the first trimester of pregnancy. If nephrotoxicity develops, azole treatment may be necessary for at least a limited time, preferably later in pregnancy.[9](#page-4-7)

A challenge in the management of coccidioidomycosis is the selection of a salvage agent when initial therapy fails or when the patient relapses (which may be years later). For azole failures, the 2016 guidelines recommend amphotericin B.[13](#page-4-12) However, voriconazole or posaconazole may also be considered. Voriconazole at doses of 400 to 600 mg/day has proven successful in a number of patients with refractory disease[.17](#page-4-16) Another salvage option is posaconazole. Published clinical experience for posaconazole is limited to its suspension form, given 200 mg four times per day with a fatty meal. More than half of salvage patients responded to posaconazole[.18](#page-4-17) Posaconazole has also been used as primary therapy with responses of 85% in 20 patients[.19](#page-4-18) Unfortunately, relapses occurred in a third of patients who initially responded. Both voriconazole and posaconazole show high in vitro activity against *Coccidioides,* but the posaconazole suspension has variable oral bioavailability. Delayed-release posaconazole tablets with improved oral bioavailability and an intravenous preparation are available.[20](#page-4-19) These new forms of posaconazole may prove to be more efficacious. Experience with isavuconazole is limited; in a series of nine patients with pulmonary coccidioidomycosis, complete or partial success was observed in 56% of patients, but only 22% had complete resolution[.21](#page-4-20)

For meningitis, treatment has changed dramatically with the availability of fluconazole; previously, intrathecal amphotericin B was required. However, intrathecal amphotericin B can cause arachnoiditis and vasculitis and should be administered with corticosteroids to suppress these inflammatory adverse events.[9](#page-4-7) It is seldom used in the post-fluconazole era, except for the treatment of coccidioidal meningitis in the first trimester of pregnancy[.13](#page-4-12) Posaconazole and voriconazole have also been used with some success in meningitis.[17,22](#page-4-16) For patients with increased intracranial pressure at the time of meningitis diagnosis, repeated lumbar punctures are recommended[.13](#page-4-12) Hydrocephalus may require ventriculoperitoneal (VP) shunting. In patients with CNS vasculitis with cerebrovascular accident due to coccidioidomycosis, those who received corticosteroids were less likely to develop additional infarcts compared with those who did not[.15](#page-4-14) Patients with meningitis require lifelong antifungal therapy.[1,9,13](#page-4-0)

Vertebral osteomyelitis may require surgical stabilization or spinal cord/nerve root decompression[.13](#page-4-12) For patients with a ruptured coccidioidal cavity, resection and decortication are recommended[.13](#page-4-12) Reduction of immunosuppression is an important adjunct to antifungal therapy, including the initiation of antiretroviral therapy if the patient has HIV infection.[1](#page-4-0) In patients with AIDS and non-meningeal coccidioidomycosis, antifungal therapy can be discontinued when the CD4 count exceeds 250 cells/mm3 .
