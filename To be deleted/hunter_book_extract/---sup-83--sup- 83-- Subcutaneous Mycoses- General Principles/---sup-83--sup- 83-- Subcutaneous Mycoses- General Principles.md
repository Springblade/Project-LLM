#### **INTRODUCTION**

Subcutaneous mycoses are chronic fungal infections resulting from percutaneous inoculation of agents from an exogenous source. The primary site of multiplication is the dermis or subcutis, and although lesions primarily are localized to the site of inoculation, there is slow and inexorable spread to surrounding tissue. Lesions usually do not undergo spontaneous remission, and if unchecked, tissue destruction can be severe. Dissemination is rare.

# **MYCETOMA (MADUROMYCOSIS, MADURA FOOT)**

#### **Introduction**

Mycetoma is a chronic, localized, slowly progressive, subcutaneous infection caused by species of actinomycetes or fungi[.1](#page-5-0) It is characterized by destructive granuloma and suppuration and by draining sinus tracts that can communicate with each other and with the skin surface. In affected tissues, filaments of the causal agents form compact grains or granules.

Mycetoma has multiple etiologies, with more than 20 species of fungi or bacteria implicated. About 40% of infections are caused by actinomycetes (actinomycetoma) and 60% by filamentous fungi (eumycetoma) ([Table 83.1\)](#page-1-0). It is important to know whether the cause is a fungus or bacterium to determine the correct therapy.

#### **Epidemiology**

Mycetoma is most commonly reported in Africa, Central and South America, India, and the Far East. It occurs in regions with a short rainy season of 4 to 6 months, daily temperature range of 30°C to 37°C, and a humidity of 60% to 80%, alternating with a dry season.

Areas of endemicity are characterized by savannah or forest and the presence of thorny trees or bushes, such as acacia scrub. Many of the agents causing mycetoma have been isolated from soil, local plants, or trees. Patients are often field laborers or herdsmen whose occupation exposes them to minor penetrating injuries.

# **Natural History, Pathogenesis, and Pathology**

Infection is initiated by traumatic implantation, often by the piercing of skin or mucosal surfaces with thorns or wood splinters[.2](#page-5-1) Once introduced subcutaneously, the agent begins to grow, eliciting a suppurative inflammatory response that is predominantly neutrophilic but can be accompanied by a granulomatous reaction. The agent appears in infected tissues as compact grains or granules up to 5 mm in diameter whose microscopic appearance may be diagnostic of the infecting species. A key feature is the formation of sinuses and fistulae that interconnect and erupt onto the skin surface.

# **Clinical Features**

The initial lesion, which appears several months after the traumatic incident, is a small, firm, painless subcutaneous nodule or plaque that progressively increases in size. The evolution of eumycetoma and actinomycetoma can differ. Lesions of eumycetoma are firm, remain localized, and progress slowly. Skin papules or nodules form pustular lesions discharging sanguineous or purulent exudates. As it progresses, there is deformity and the production of draining sinus tracts through which fungal grains are expelled [\(Fig. 83.1](#page-1-1)). In actinomycetoma, progression is often more rapid. Lesions have less well-defined margins, sinus tracts are prominent, and involvement of bone is earlier and more extensive than in eumycetomas.

Most mycetomas are painless, even when well established. Mycetoma can result in loss of function of an infected limb and consequent inability to work, as the condition does not spontaneously remit. The foot is the most common site involved, with about 70% of infections affecting the lower limbs. Other sites include the buttocks and perineum, hands, back, and scalp.

#### **Diagnosis and Differential Diagnosis**

#### Diagnosis

Grains produced by different agents may be distinctive enough for the diagnosis to be made by examination of hematoxylin and eosin–stained tissue sections [\(Fig. 83.2](#page-1-2)). Fungal grains have a coarser texture and may be pigmented, consisting of a dense mass of interwoven filaments (hyphae) 2 to 5 µm in diameter. Actinomycete grains are more finely textured—the filaments are 1 µm or less in diameter—and are not individually distinguishable.

#### Direct Examination

Exudates should be examined for the presence of grains. Opening a surface pustule over a sinus tract with a sterile needle may reveal them. Differentiation of fungal and actinomycete grains is readily

### **Culture or Molecular Detection**

In view of the multiple etiologies, a range of culture media and conditions of incubation should be employed. There are no commercially available molecular tests.

#### Imaging

X-ray, ultrasound, and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI)scanning are useful in delineating the extent and presence of bone invasion. Cavities, periosteal spicules, and proliferation formation are present[.3](#page-5-2)

#### Differential Diagnosis

Chronic osteomyelitis of bacterial etiology—for example, syphilitic, actinomycotic, or tuberculous—may resemble mycetoma,

<span id="page-1-2"></span>particularly in the early stages. Botryomycosis, in which persistent bacterial infection is associated with granule and sinus formation, must also be distinguished.

#### **Treatment**

#### Eumycetoma

Eumycetoma is poorly responsive to chemotherapy; however, a trial of chemotherapy may be justified. *Madurella mycetomatis* infections may respond to itraconazole, and voriconazole is active in some cases.[4](#page-5-3) Fosravuconazole may also be effective. Surgical removal plus antifungal therapy is an alternative. In advanced cases of eumycetoma, amputation may be the only way to achieve eradication.

#### Actinomycetoma

Medical treatment with trimethoprim/sulfamethoxazole (cotrimoxazole) and rifampin is often effective. Good results have been claimed with a combination of dapsone and streptomycin. Alternatives include amikacin, linezolid, meropenem, and fusidic acid.

# **SPOROTRICHOSIS**

# **Introduction**

Sporotrichosis is a chronic fungal infection principally affecting the skin, lymphatics, and subcutaneous tissues. Pulmonary and disseminated forms, with involvement of the lungs, osteoarticular and musculoskeletal tissues, viscera, mucous membranes, and central nervous system (CNS), are uncommon. Sporotrichosis is caused by several species, such as *Sporothrix schenckii, S. braziliensis,* and *S. globosa,* which are widely distributed as soil saprophytes. *Sporothrix* is dimorphic, existing as a mold in nature and a yeast in infected tissue.

# **Epidemiology**

Sporotrichosis occurs worldwide but is most common in warm, temperate, or tropical countries, typically in Central and South America, Africa, and Australasia.[5](#page-5-4) Most cases are sporadic, but epidemics can occur in hyperendemic areas. A large outbreak that occurred in Rio de Janeiro, Brazil, was attributed to spread from infected cats (*S. braziliensis*)[.6](#page-5-5) The disease affects individuals whose occupation brings them into contact with soil, plants, or plant materials, such as straw, wood, or reeds.

#### **Natural History, Pathogenesis, and Pathology**

The agent is rarely seen in histopathologic material from primary infections. When present, it is often pleomorphic, appearing as small, round, oval or cigar-shaped budding yeast cells, 2 to 3 µm wide by 3 to 8 µm long. In some instances, a central fungal cell is surrounded by radiating eosinophilic material (asteroid body).

#### **Clinical Features**

The route of entry is via minor traumatic subcutaneous inoculation. The incubation period varies from 1 to 4 weeks and, rarely, up to 6 months. About 75% of infections affect an upper extremity. There is evidence that some patients have self-limited infections.[7](#page-5-6)

#### Cutaneous Sporotrichosis

The most common form of sporotrichosis is lymphangitic, in which a small, firm, movable subcutaneous nodule develops at the site of inoculation. The nodule later becomes soft and breaks down to form a persistent friable ulcer or chancre [\(Fig. 83.3](#page-2-0)). Subsequently, additional nodules develop along the draining lymphatics that progress to ulceration. The presence of a persistent ulcer on a finger or hand and a chain of swollen lymph nodes extending up the arm is suspicious for sporotrichosis. In about a quarter of cutaneous infections, the lesion remains "fixed," without lymphatic spread. Fixed infections are more common in children and in Latin America. Less commonly, lesions may present as chronic ulcers, mycetoma-like lesions, or well-defined granulomas. Disseminated cutaneous lesions have been reported in patients with AIDS.

#### Pulmonary Sporotrichosis

Primary pulmonary infection is rare. It can be asymptomatic, but in individuals with a low level of immunity, it can progress to disseminated disease.

![](_page_2_Picture_17.jpeg)

**Fig. 83.3** Cutaneous sporotrichosis demonstrating nodular lesions that have broken down to form a friable ulcer.

#### <span id="page-2-0"></span>Disseminated Sporotrichosis

This is uncommon and is generally seen in persons with underlying disease or a predisposition, such as alcoholism, diabetes, and HIV infection[.8](#page-5-7) It originates by hematogenous spread, usually from the lung. Sites affected include skin, joints, lungs, bone, mucous membranes, and the CNS.

#### **Diagnosis and Differential Diagnosis**

Classic cutaneous lymphatic sporotrichosis is distinct, but the variability of other forms can make diagnosis difficult. Direct examination of pus or skin is seldom helpful, and *Sporothrix* organisms are usually absent or rare in tissue sections. Culture is of the greatest value—*Sporothrix* is readily isolated from clinical material, but full species identification depends on molecular tools.

Sporotrichosis must be distinguished from other mycoses and from infective skin lesions, such as tularemia, leishmaniasis, anthrax, tuberculosis, and pyogenic infection. Lymphatic spread similar to sporotrichosis can occur in *Mycobacterium marinum* and some South American forms of cutaneous leishmaniasis.

#### **Treatment**

Treatment of sporotrichosis depends on the syndrome[.9](#page-5-8) Cutaneous disease is treated with itraconazole 200 mg daily, given for 2 to 4 weeks after lesions have resolved, usually for a total of 3 to 6 months. Fluconazole and saturated potassium iodide are alternatives. An adult can be given 1 mL of KI three times daily, with drops in incremental increases to a maximum of 4 to 6 mL three times daily after 1 month. Liposomal amphotericin B (1 mg/kg daily for adults) is the drug of choice for pulmonary and disseminated sporotrichosis. Once the patient has clinically responded, a switch to itraconazole can be made, for a total duration of 12 months.

#### **CHROMOBLASTOMYCOSIS**

#### **Introduction**

Chromoblastomycosis (chromomycosis) is a chronic mycosis affecting skin and subcutaneous tissues characterized by slowgrowing verrucous nodules that coalesce and form hyperkeratotic plaques[.10](#page-5-9) It is caused by several species of related fungi; the most common are *Fonsecaea pedrosoi, F. compactum, Phialophora verrucosa,* and *Cladophialophora carrionni.* Each appears identically in infected tissues, that is, single or clustered, rounded or angular, thick-walled and dark-brown bodies ("sclerotic or muriform cells"). These saprophytic organisms are commonly found in soil and wood.

#### **Epidemiology**

Chromoblastomycosis is diagnosed more frequently in males than in females and is more prevalent in rural than urban areas. The disease has a worldwide distribution with a high prevalence in Costa Rica (1/21,000 population) and Madagascar (1/30,000 population).

#### **Natural History, Pathogenesis, and Pathology**

The disease follows implantation from the environment and is seen in healthy individuals.

# **Clinical Manifestations**

The initial lesion is a warty papule on an exposed site—for example, leg or arm—that enlarges slowly to form a verrucous plaque. In some instances, the primary lesion is a pustule, a flat plaque, or an ulcer [\(Fig. 83.4\)](#page-3-0).[11](#page-5-10) As infection progresses, ulceration and serous exudation occur. Non-painful, large, hyperkeratotic plaques up to 3 cm thick with central scar formation occur. Super-infection may be responsible for lymphostasis and resultant elephantiasis, and secondary infected lesions have an unpleasant smell.

# **Diagnosis and Differential Diagnosis**

Clinical history and manifestations are often diagnostic. Lesions are usually hyperkeratotic and characterized by pseudoepitheliomatous hyperplasia with microabscess formation. On microscopy of scrapings, distinctive brown fungal cells can be identified in 20% potassium hydroxide [\(Fig. 83.5](#page-3-1)). In tissue sections, fungal cells (i.e., muriform cells or sclerotic bodies) are 5 to 12 µm in diameter, common in some sections and rare in others. Culture and identification of the specific etiologic agent should be done by a specialist laboratory because the polymorphic

appearance of many isolates makes their positive identification difficult.

Chromoblastomycosis can resemble cutaneous tuberculosis, leishmaniasis, syphilis, and yaws.

#### **Treatment**

No antifungal regimen is universally satisfactory, although itraconazole (200–400 mg/day) and terbinafine (500 mg/day) have been effective. In extensive lesions, amphotericin B should be given intravenously at the outset of treatment; in some cases, flucytosine is given in addition. Local application of heat may be effective.

#### **RHINOSPORIDIOSIS**

# **Introduction**

Rhinosporidiosis is a chronic, localized granulomatous condition that presents with polyp-like lesions. The causative organism has been identified by genetic techniques as a member of the aquatic *Protista* rather than a fungus[.12](#page-5-11) There are no experimental models, and the organism cannot be cultured. Ninety percent of reported cases are from India and Sri Lanka.

Rhinosporidiosis is most commonly seen in children and young adults, and in males more than females (three to one).

The most common site of rhinosporidiosis is the nose (70% of cases), with sessile or pedunculated polyps affecting the nostrils. Lesions can affect the conjunctiva and, rarely, the larynx, genitals, and skin. Dissemination is exceptional.

# **Diagnosis and Differential Diagnosis**

Examination of hematoxylin and eosin–stained sections reveals sporangia of varying sizes and stages of development. Culture and serologic tests are not helpful. Nasal lesions must be distinguished from polyps; lesions in other sites, particularly in the perianal region, must be distinguished from warts, condylomata, and hemorrhoids.

#### **Treatment**

Chemotherapy is of little proven value. The treatment of choice is surgical excision.

# **SUBCUTANEOUS MUCORMYCOSIS CAUSED BY BASIDIOBOLUS**

#### **Introduction**

Subcutaneous mucormycosism or basidiobolomycosis (subcutaneous zygomycosis), is a localized mycosis of the subcutaneous tissue. The causal fungus is *Basidiobolus haptosporus,* a mucoromycete. Cases are usually reported from India and sub-Saharan Africa. The condition affects children and adolescents rather than adults, and boys rather than girls.

#### **Pathogenesis and Pathology**

The mode of entry has not been established, but most likely follows implantation from an exogenous source.

#### **Clinical Manifestations**

Subcutaneous swellings are firm, movable, and well defined; satellite lesions may be palpable at the advancing margins.[13](#page-5-12)

The overlying skin is usually intact and may be tense, edematous, hyperpigmented, or normal in color. Ulceration occurs, but is uncommon, and pain and tenderness are usually absent. Any part of the body may be affected, but the most common sites are the limbs, buttocks, and neck. Regional lymph nodes are rarely affected.

#### **Diagnosis and Differential Diagnosis**

Histology shows strands of broad, 5- to 15-µm, thin-walled, branching, and generally non-septate hyphae toward the edge of the lesions, each with an eosinophilic sheath several micrometers wide (Splendore–Hoepple phenomenon). The lesion is characterized by eosinophil infiltration and granuloma formation. Cutaneous lymphoma can appear similar to subcutaneous mucormycosis, but is characterized by a more rapid onset. Other differentials include scleroderma and pretibial myxedema.

#### **Treatment**

The most effective treatment is itraconazole in doses of 100 to 200 mg daily. An alternative is oral potassium iodide (KI) in saturated solution in doses up to 6 mL three times daily for 3 months. Amphotericin B has been used in patients refractory to the other treatments.

#### **SUBCUTANEOUS MUCORMYCOSIS CAUSED BY CONIDIOBOLUS**

# **Introduction**

Infections with *Conidiobolus coronatus* (rhinoentomophthoromycosis, conidiobolomycosis) lead to chronic, localized subcutaneous infection affecting tissues of the nose, cheek, and upper lip.[14](#page-5-13)

#### **Epidemiology**

*C. coronatus* is a mucoromycete found in tropical rainforest areas. In contrast to zygomycosis caused by *Basidiobolus,* condidiobolomycosis is a disease of young adults rather than children, and males more often than females. Most infections are reported from West Africa, particularly Nigeria, but cases have been recognized in India and South America.

<span id="page-4-0"></span>The mode of infection is unknown, but is probably inoculation of contaminated soil or vegetable matter through minor trauma or insect bites.

#### **Clinical Manifestations**

Infection apparently originates in the nasal mucosa, leading to nasal obstruction, which may be unilateral. Tissue swelling becomes pronounced and affects the nose and nasolabial folds, cheeks, and upper lip, eventually producing gross facial distortion ([Fig. 83.6](#page-4-0)). The infected areas have distinct margins, but the mass is not movable over the underlying tissues.

# **Diagnosis and Differential Diagnosis**

The clinical features are distinctive, that is, localized swelling of the nose and face in tropical countries. Biopsy may be diagnostic when characteristic hyphae are present and associated with an eosinophilic sheath and eosinophilic granuloma, as with *Basidiobolus* infections. *Conidiobolus* and *Basidobolus* infections can be differentiated by the site involved.

# **Treatment**

Treatment is the same as for *Basidiobolus* (see earlier section).

#### **OTHER SUBCUTANEOUS MYCOSES**

#### **Phaeohyphomycosis**

Introduction and Epidemiology

Phaeohyphomycosis is an infection with dark-pigmented fungi that are clinically and pathologically distinct from chromoblastomycosis or mycetoma; in tissue the organisms appear with irregular hyphae. The range of causal organisms is wide, embracing some 16 genera and almost 30 species.

# Clinical Manifestations and Treatment

Lesions are usually solitary and circumscribed, occurring on the feet, legs, hands, and other body sites.[15](#page-5-14) Over a period of months or years, the lesions may increase in size, producing a crusted or cystic mass that remains localized. Diagnosis depends on the recognition of brown fungal elements by direct microscopy or in tissue sections, which may be filamentous, irregularly swollen, or yeastlike, and by isolation and identification of the agents in a specialist laboratory. The treatment for localized forms of the disease is surgical excision.

#### **Lobomycosis**

Lobomycosis, or Lobo's disease, is a chronic, localized mycosis of skin and subcutaneous tissues characterized by keloidal or verrucoid lesions that contain abundant lemon-shaped fungal cells. The disease is rare and only recorded in remote tropical areas of South and Central America. It has also been described in freshwater dolphins. The causative organism, *Lacazia loboi,* has not been isolated and its habitat is unknown.[16](#page-5-15)

Patients present with circumscribed plaques or keloid-like lesions usually on exposed areas such as the face, ears, or trunk. These may slowly increase in size, and plaques can cover wide areas of the body. They are usually asymptomatic. The diagnosis is made by biopsy. The organisms appear as chains of cells, each with a short, tubelike connection between individual cells.

The best treatment is excision.
