# **104.2** Visceral Leishmaniasis (Kala-Azar)

*Naomi E. Aronson, Alan J. Magill* [†](#page-0-0)

## **DEFINITION**

VL is a systemic illness caused by parasites of the *L. donovani* complex and characterized by irregular fever, enlargement of the spleen and liver, weight loss, pancytopenia, and hypergammaglobulinemia. The disease is also known as *Kala-azar* (Hindi for black fever) because some patients show hyperpigmentation of the skin of the hands, feet, face, or abdomen.

## **ETIOLOGY**

VL is most often caused by species of the *L. donovani* complex: (1) *L. donovani sensu sticto* in the Indian subcontinent; (2) *L. donovani sensu lato* in East Africa; and (3) *L. infantum (syn. L. chagasi)* found around the Mediterranean littoral, the Middle East, Africa, China and the Americas ([Fig. 104.2.1\)](#page-1-0). Organisms with biochemical characteristics of *L. tropica* have occasionally been isolated from bone marrow cultures of patients with VL and "viscerotropic leishmaniasis" in Kenya, the Middle East, and India[.1](#page-6-0) Emerging foci of novel parasites related to the *L. enrietta* complex causing VL infection (i.e., *L. martiniquensis* or the not formally described but similar *L. siamensis*) are described from the Caribbean region, Guyana, Myanmar, and Thailand[.2–4](#page-7-0)

## **DISTRIBUTION**

Mediterranean Kala-azar caused by *L. infantum* is found in Portugal, Spain, France, Italy, Greece, Croatia, Bosnia-Herzogovina, Montenegro, Macedonia, Serbia, North Africa, the Mediterranean islands, Lebanon, Iraq, Iran, Saudi Arabia, Yemen, southern Russia, central Asia, and northern China (see [Fig. 104.2.1\)](#page-1-0). Indian Kala-azar (caused by *L. donovani*) occurs in the eastern part of India (Assam, Bengal, Bihar, Uttar Pradesh, Madras, Sikkim), Nepal, and Bangladesh. African Kala-azar (*L. donovani)* is common in Kenya, Ethiopia, and the Sudan, but sporadic cases occur in Chad, the Upper Volta, the Central African Republic, Uganda, the Democratic Republic of Congo, Zambia, and Somalia. American Kala-azar caused by *L. infantum* (*syn. chagasi*) is in northeastern Brazil, Paraguay, Argentina, Venezuela, Colombia, Guatemala, El Salvador, Honduras, and Mexico (see [Fig. 104.2.1B](#page-1-0)).

## **TRANSMISSION AND EPIDEMIOLOGY**

VL is transmitted by phlebotomine sandflies of the genera *Phlebotomus* in the Old World (see [Fig. 104.1.3\)](#page--1-0) and *Lutzomyia* in the New World. Regional epidemiology depends on the interaction of sandflies, reservoir hosts, and susceptible humans. VL is associated with poor nutrition and poverty. Population movements of nonimmune individuals into endemic areas can result in epidemics.

## **Reservoir Hosts**

In India, where the domesticated sandfly vector *Phlebotomus argentipes* feeds solely on humans, people appear to be the only reservoir. Recent studies in Brazil suggest that asymptomatically infected persons can transmit *L. infantum* to the sandfly vector and that this transmission is increased in ill HIV co-infected persons[.5](#page-7-1)

Dogs (and recently recognized cats) are the main reservoirs for *L. infantum*–associated disease. VL usually occurs in infants and young children (non-immune hosts) or in immune-compromised individuals. In southern France, central Italy, and Brazil, foxes with unapparent infection are the reservoir, and VL is primarily a rural disease affecting older children and adults. Jackals are probably an important source of the sporadic, mainly rural, cases that occur in the Middle East and central Asia.

The reservoir of VL in Africa is incompletely understood. In Kenya, where *P. martini* is the probable vector, epidemics of VL occurred in the 1950s and 1970s, suggesting a human reservoir,

In: Bennett JE, Dolin R, Blaser MJ (Eds). Mandell, Douglas, and Bennett's Principles and Practice of Infectious Diseases 8th edition 2014; Elsevier: Philadelphia.)

but domestic dogs have occasionally been found infected with *L. donovani.* In the Sudan, VL usually occurs sporadically in nomads, who occupy temporary villages in the dry season near patches of scrub that harbor the vector *P. orientalis. L. donovani* has been isolated from rodents in the Sudan; rodents may be important in maintaining enzootic foci in inter-epidemic periods.

## **PATHOGENESIS**

After inoculation by the sandfly, promastigotes enter reticuloendothelial cells and multiply. Parasites spread to local lymph nodes and then, hematogenously within macrophages, to the liver, spleen, and bone marrow, resulting in a spectrum of outcomes from asymptomatic infection to oligosymptomatic disease, with spontaneous resolution or disseminated infection with the clinical syndrome of VL. In sub-clinical cases or in lymphatic leishmaniasis, there are non-caseating granulomas and giant cell reaction. The bone marrow usually contains numerous parasite-laden macrophages. The skin may contain *Leishmania* and, in fatal cases, all levels beneath the epidermis are often heavily infiltrated, with masses of parasitized cells concentrated around the sweat glands and arterioles.

## **CLINICAL MANIFESTATIONS**

## **Sub-Clinical or Oligosymptomatic Infections**

In areas of endemic VL, many inhabitants develop a positive skin test (or positive interferon-gamma release test result) without a history of overt clinical disease—such individuals appear to be resistant to further infection with *L. donovani.* The difference between asymptomatic infection and oligosymptomatic disease is difficult to establish in most endemic areas, because the etiology of non-specific illness is rarely diagnosed and does not warrant evaluation in the context of the culture and health care infrastructure. For example, in a prospective study in Brazil, 28 out of 86 children with antibodies to *L. donovani* developed classic VL within a few weeks to 15 months after seroconversion. Twenty others remained asymptomatic during observation for up to 5 years, and 38 had a prolonged "sub-clinical" illness manifested by mild constitutional symptoms and intermittent hepatomegaly that resolved without anti-leishmanial treatment after an average of 35 months[.6](#page-7-2) Other reports of non-specific, chronic illness associated with "viscerotropic" *Leishmania* infection have come from Ital[y7](#page-7-3) and Saudi Arabia[.1](#page-6-0) These relatively mild, non-specific illnesses are characterized by cough, malaise, chronic fatigue, abdominal pain, diarrhea, and intermittent fevers; *Leishmania* was parasitologically confirmed from bone marrow or lymph node aspirates. Therefore "viscerotropic" leishmaniasis should be considered in individuals with unexplained constitutional complaints in endemic areas or in travelers with a history of exposure.

## **Symptoms of Kala-Azar**

The incubation period is generally 2 to 6 months, although disease occasionally occurs many years after the patient has left an endemic area. The patient usually does not recall a primary skin lesion. The onset of the disease in immunologically naïve adults (migrants, soldiers, and visitors to an endemic area) may be acute in onset with high fever, chills, and malaise[.8](#page-7-4) This syndrome, initially described early in the 20th century in India, is often mistaken for malaria; however, early clinicians commented that patients with VL did not appear as "toxic" as malaria patients. In endemic areas, the disease progression is described as more gradual, with chronic intermittent fever, progressive enlargement of the spleen and liver, and vague abdominal discomfort. Other common symptoms include weight loss, epistaxis, diarrhea, and non-productive cough.

## **Signs of Kala-Azar**

The patient is often weak and emaciated. Fever is common, classically described as double quotidian, but can be intermittent or constant. The abdomen is usually distended by a markedly enlarged spleen and a moderately enlarged liver ([Fig. 104.2.2\)](#page-2-0). Generally the spleen is non-tender and firm, although in acute VL it may feel softer. Femoral and inguinal lymphadenopathy is often noted, especially in African VL. Edema of the legs, jaundice, petechiae, and purpura may sometimes be noted. Immunocompromised hosts often present with gastrointestinal involvement, mucosal lesions, or disseminated skin lesions. Mucosal lesions are occasionally seen in patients with VL in the Sudan and rarely in patients from East Africa and India. Lesions appear as nodules or ulcers of the gum, palate, tongue, lip, or nasal septum perforation. Mucosal lesions respond to therapy and may be caused by an exaggerated, nonhealing immune response. Uncommon systemic manifestations associated with overt VL include retinal hemorrhages, massive hepatic necrosis, pancytopenia without splenomegaly, cholecystitis, and distal extremity paresthesias. *Leishmania* infection is a treatable cause of secondary hematophagocytic syndrome, especially in children.[9](#page-7-5) This syndrome is oligoparasitic, and parasitologic confirmation can be difficult.[10](#page-7-6)

## **Laboratory Abnormalities**

## Hematologic

Hemoglobin concentrations of 5 to 9 g/dL, white blood cell counts of 2000 to 4000/mm3 , and platelet counts of 50,000 to 200,000/ mm3 are typical, although much lower counts are sometimes seen in advanced disease.[11](#page-7-7) There is an almost complete absence of eosinophils. Agranulocytosis is rare. The erythrocyte sedimentation rate is often elevated to 50 to 60 mm/h.

## Other

Liver transaminases (alanine transaminase [ALT] more than aspartate transaminase [AST]) are mildly elevated in the majority of patients, but elevations of serum bilirubin are less common. The prothrombin time is usually 2 to 4 seconds longer than that in controls, and serum albumin is generally less than 3 g/dL. A polyclonal hypergammaglobulinemia of 5 to 10 g/dL, most of which is IgG, is usual. Renal findings may be normal, but concentration defects, red and white blood cells in the urine, proteinuria, and decreased glomerular filtration rate have been reported.

## <span id="page-2-0"></span>**Complications**

Bacterial pneumonia may be present on admission or may develop during treatment. Pulmonary tuberculosis and HIV are common co-infections and should be suspected in any patient responding poorly to specific anti-*Leishmania* therapy. Cancrum oris, a necrotizing oral infection, occurs late in the course when neutropenia is severe. Post–Kala-azar anterior uveitis can occur after treatment for VL. Patients present with deteriorating visual acuity—slit lamp examination shows irregular nodules in the iris. Other rare ocular complications reported are retinal hemorrhages, keratitis, central retinal vein thrombosis, papillitis, and iritis. Death in patients with VL is often associated with, and perhaps caused by, concurrent infections, for example, tuberculosis, dysentery, measles, and bacterial pneumonias. Deaths caused by cardiac failure in severely anemic persons also occur.

## **Visceral Leishmaniasis Infection in Immunocompromised Hosts**

Before the routine use of highly active antiretroviral therapy (HAART) for HIV infection, *Leishmania* was a significant opportunistic infection in patients with AIDS. Co-infection with *Leishmania* and HIV is a recognized problem in the Southern Mediterranean area and has been reported in 20 other countries[.12](#page-7-8) As the incidence of HIV infection increases in India, Brazil, and East Africa, the numbers of people at risk of co-infection will also increase dramatically.

VL usually occurs as a late-stage opportunistic infection in patients with AIDS. CD4 T-lymphocyte counts are usually less than 100/mm3 and are almost always less than 200/mm3 . [13–17](#page-7-9) In general, AIDS patients with overt VL have high parasite burdens but seem to tolerate the parasite co-infection reasonably well. Numerous viscerotropic, dermotropic, and novel *L. infantum* zymodemes have been isolated from co-infected patients in Europe.

The clinical presentation of VL in AIDS patients is similar to the presentation in non–HIV-infected hosts, although some differences have been noted[.18](#page-7-10) Fever, splenomegaly, and pancytopenia are common; in immunosuppressed but not HIV-infected persons, more fever, less organomegaly, and leukopenia was described in comparison to HIV co-infection. Involvement of the gastrointestinal tract is more common in AIDS patients; abundant parasite-laden macrophages are found in the submucosa from the esophagus to the rectum. Co-infected patients may have atypical presentations that include a variety of pulmonary syndromes (i.e., pleural effusion and pulmonary nodules).

The principles of diagnosis in HIV–co-infected patients are not different. The parasite burden tends to be higher, and serologic tests may be negative; therefore classic parasitologic methods are preferable. Fever or hepatosplenomegaly in an HIV-infected patient who has resided in or visited an area endemic for VL should prompt an examination of the bone marrow with smears, cultures, and PCR for *Leishmania.* Blood quantitative *Leishmania* PCR is starting to replace biopsy as the initial diagnostic approach, as well as for following for parasite blood load as an indicator for relapse, which is highly common in HIV co-infection[.19,20](#page-7-11)

VL may also occur as an opportunistic infection in immunocompromised patients associated with solid organ (renal, heart) transplantation[,21](#page-7-12) persons receiving immunosuppressive therapy[,22,23](#page-7-13) and chronic corticosteroid use[.24](#page-7-14) The use of biologic immune response–modifying therapies such as TNF inhibitors is an emerging risk factor. Unexplained fever, splenomegaly, and cytopenias in an immunocompromised patient with an appropriate exposure history should prompt consideration of leishmaniasis. Standard parasitologic diagnostic methods are usually sufficient.

## **POST–KALA-AZAR DERMAL LEISHMANIASIS**

PKDL is a cutaneous syndrome seen after the treatment of VL due to *L. donovani,* usually with pentavalent antimony.[25–27](#page-7-15) The syndrome consists of macules and papules first occurring around the mouth and spreading to the rest of the face ([Fig. 104.2.3](#page-3-0)) and, to a lesser extent, on the extensor surfaces of the arms, the trunk, and occasionally, the legs. Initially, they appear as small hypopigmented patches, which enlarge and may progress to nodules that sometimes resemble leprosy. Diagnosis is based on a typical rash and distribution and a history of prior VL and is confirmed with a skin biopsy evaluated with a *Leishmania* PCR.

PKDL occurs in up to 20% of patients with VL in India, with skin lesions usually appearing 2 to 10 years after successful treatment of VL. PKDL has been reported in over 50% of Sudanese treated VL patients, and the onset of PKDL was reported to occur at a mean of 56 days (range: 0–180 days).

Histologically, there is a spectrum of cellular responses, varying from numerous parasites with few inflammatory cells to a granulomatous reaction containing few parasites. Parasites isolated from patients with PKDL are biochemically identical to *L. donovani* isolated from patients with VL. In immunocompromised persons, PKDL due to *L. infantum* parasites may be seen. Because the lesions of PKDL may persist for up to 20 years, such patients may act as a chronic reservoir of infection, although this has recently been challenged in a household study where no seroconversions among family members were noted[.28](#page-7-16)

## <span id="page-3-0"></span>**DIAGNOSIS**

## **Clinical Diagnosis**

A clinical diagnosis of VL can be made with varying degrees of certainty, depending on the local epidemiologic factors and clinical presentation. A confirmatory parasitologic diagnosis is preferable before starting treatment; in settings where safely performing an invasive procedure is difficult, a presumptive diagnosis can be made using a serologic test (such as rK39 immunochromatographic test) and assessing whether clinical improvement in response to appropriate therapy is seen within a week or so.

## **Demonstration of Parasites**

Specimens can be obtained from the bone marrow, liver, spleen, or enlarged lymph nodes. Splenic aspiration has the highest sensitivity. In experienced hands, the procedure is safe and well tolerated; however, deaths have occurred after splenic aspiration in 1:100 procedures, presumably due to splenic laceration—careful observation after the procedure is mandatory.[29,30](#page-7-17) Contraindications to splenic aspiration are a soft spleen, a prothrombin time ≥5 seconds compared with the normal control, or a platelet count below 40,000/mm3 . Splenic smears stained with Giemsa's or Leishman's stain demonstrate amastigotes in >95% of cases. Splenic smears are often quantitated by the method of Chulay to assist in response to therapy[.31](#page-7-18)

Bone marrow aspiration is preferred because of concern about the hazards of splenic aspiration and unfamiliarity with the technique. Bone marrow smears usually contain relatively fewer amastigotes, and parasites are found in only 50% to 85% of cases compared with splenic aspirates. Amastigotes are also frequently found in aspirates or biopsies of liver specimens or lymph nodes. Buffy coat smears can demonstrate amastigotes in Indian and Kenyan VL or in co-infected AIDS patients.

The confirmation of VL is usually not difficult, as it is a polyparasitic syndrome; however, the parasite burden in early disease in non-immune persons or in those with hemophagocytic syndrome can be very light, and more sensitive techniques such as culture (see "[General Principles"](#page--1-1) section) and PCR are needed. PCR amplification of *Leishmania* DNA from tissues such as liver and bone marrow are routinely reported. The early macules and hypopigmented lesions of PKDL have few parasites, but papular or nodular lesions of PKDL usually have abundant parasites and can easily be seen on smears or grown in culture.

## **Serologic Tests**

High-titer anti-leishmanial antibodies are present in VL and can be detected by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA), immunofluorescence, and direct agglutination. Sensitivity and specificity vary based on the antigens used in the assay and the infecting parasites. Whole promastigotes, crude promastigote lysates, and recombinant antigens are in use. In general, current serologic tests for VL have sensitivities >90% but with lower specificities. False-positive results, especially with lower titers, can be seen in malaria, trypanosomiasis, tuberculosis, enteric fever, and schistosomiasis[.32–34](#page-7-19) In addition, antibodies may persist for many months to years after treatment for VL.

The ELISA test using whole, soluble promastigote or recombinant antigens appears as sensitive and specific as the indirect fluorescent antibody (IFA) test and, because of economy and technical practicality, it is especially useful for large-scale epidemiologic studies.

The IFA is positive in more than 95% of patients with VL, generally with titers above 1:256. IFA testing is somewhat subjective and requires rigorous technique and relatively expensive equipment.

The direct agglutination test (DAT) is based on direct agglutination of *L. donovani* promastigotes that react specifically with anti-*Leishmania* antibodies in the serum specimen, resulting in agglutination of the promastigotes. DAT test sensitivity and specificity estimates were 94.8% (95% confidence interval 92.7%–96.4%) and 85.9% (72.3%–93.4%), respectively, in a meta-analysis[.35](#page-7-20)

The recombinant protein rK39 is used as the capture antigen in ELISA tests and in point-of-care, dipstick-type, rapid diagnostic tests to detect antibodies in the serum of patients with VL. In the same meta-analysis, the rK39 test sensitivity and specificity were very similar to the DAT at 93.9% (87.7%–97.1%) and 90.6% (66.8%–97.9%), respectively.[35](#page-7-20) Sensitivity is higher and more homogeneous in the studies carried out in South Asia, and the specificity varies depending on the choice of controls. In East Africa lower sensitivities of 75% to 92% were noted; another recombinant antigen, rK28, showed improved sensitivity.[35–37](#page-7-20) A Food and Drug Administration (FDA)–cleared rK39 assay is commercially available (Kalazar Detect, Inbios International, Inc., Seattle, WA, USA; [http://www.inbios.com/rapid-tests/kalazar](http://www.inbios.com/rapid-tests/kalazar-detect)[detect](http://www.inbios.com/rapid-tests/kalazar-detect)). The rK39 test is not useful in screening asymptomatic individuals for infection but should be used in individuals with a compatible clinical syndrome.

## **Differential Diagnosis**

The differential diagnosis of late-stage VL is limited. Hematologic and lymphatic malignancies, disseminated histoplasmosis, and hepatosplenic schistosomiasis may mimic late-stage VL. Early VL has a broader differential that includes malaria, African trypanosomiasis, brucellosis, enteric fevers, bacterial endocarditis, disseminated histoplasmosis, chronic myelocytic leukemia, Hodgkin's disease and other lymphomas, sarcoidosis, hepatic cirrhosis, and tuberculosis. Hyper-reactive malaria splenomegaly (tropical splenomegaly syndrome) is especially difficult to differentiate, although high titers of anti-malarial antibodies and a characteristic histologic appearance of the liver suggest it. Patients with multiple myeloma and Waldenström's macroglobulinemia have monoclonal hypergammaglobulinemia, and this may confound the diagnosis.

## **TREATMENT**

## **Non-Specific or Supportive Care**

Patients should receive a nutritious diet, as patients are often malnourished. Antimicrobial agents are given when concurrent pneumonia, tuberculosis, or other bacterial infections are suspected. Patients with chronic disease generally tolerate anemia well, but blood transfusion may be needed if associated with respiratory distress or the hemoglobin level falls below 6 g/dL. Co-existent vitamin deficiency may also require specific treatment. Lastly, patients with VL should be assessed for HIV co-infection or other immunosuppressing conditions.

## **Specific Anti-Leishmanial Therapy**

Pentavalent antimony compounds (SbV) have historically been used for the treatment of VL worldwide. However, reports of primary treatment failures with SbV in India became prevalent in the mid-1990s, leading to trials of amphotericin B compounds as initial therapy for both Mediterranean and Indian VL. Currently, liposomal amphotericin B is the drug of choice for treatment of VL, except in East Africa. SbV remains efficacious for the treatment of VL when given at appropriate doses in East Africa (recommended in combination with paromomycin) and the Americas.

## Pentavalent Antimonials (SbV)

There are two widely available commercial SbV formulations: sodium stibogluconate (SSG; Pentostam, GlaxoSmithKline, UK), largely used in English-speaking countries, and meglumine antimoniate (Glucantime, Sanofi, Brazil), commonly used in Latin America and French-speaking parts of Africa and Europe. Globally, there are numerous local and regional manufacturers of SSG and other SbV formulations. One generic SSG product (Albert David Ltd.) has demonstrated equivalency to branded SbV[.38,39](#page-7-21) However, it is unwise to assume one generic preparation will perform the same as another or have the same safety and tolerability profile. Deaths have been associated with the use of generic SbV with high osmolarity.[40,41](#page-7-22)

SbV can be administered intravenously or intramuscularly. There is variation in the total antimony (Sb) content, the proportion of SbV to trivalent Sb (trivalent Sb is more toxic than SbV), and the physical and chemical characteristics of different lots of SbV from the same manufacturer and between preparations from different manufacturers. In addition, SbV dissociates or polymerizes over time, so storage conditions and shelf-life are important considerations. Storage at 4°C in the dark is optimal.

In the United States, Pentostam is available from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) under an investigational new drug (IND) application. The recommended treatment regimen for VL is 20 mg of SbV/kg/day given intravenously for 28 days. Undiluted intravenous injections are not recommended; the daily dose can be given as a 1:10 dilution with 5% D/W (dextrose water) to reduce the incidence of local thrombosis. In endemic areas, the intramuscular route of administration is more common, although the large-volume injections are moderately painful.

SbV drugs are safe, although with a poorly tolerated side effect profile. Nausea, anorexia, abdominal pain, malaise, headache, rash, arthralgias, myalgias, and lethargy are frequent, beginning about 7 to 10 days into therapy[.42](#page-7-23) Fortunately, these symptoms usually resolve soon after therapy is complete.

Shortly after beginning therapy, patients treated with SbV preparations develop elevations in serum lipase greater than amylase, which peak at 7 to 14 days[.42,43](#page-7-23) Lipase and amylase levels return to normal despite continuing the drug. Although most are asymptomatic, some develop anorexia, nausea, and mid-epigastric pain consistent with clinical pancreatitis. Deaths attributed to pancreatic necrosis have been reported in patients receiving SbV[;44](#page-7-24) therefore monitoring of serum amylase and lipase is recommended. When patients develop symptoms or signs of pancreatitis, it is recommended that SSG be temporarily halted for a few days and pancreatic enzyme levels will return to normal; the regimen can then usually be completed without another interruption.

Anemia, neutropenia, and thrombocytopenia are occasionally severe enough to interrupt SbV therapy; abnormalities reverse on discontinuation of the drug. Baseline values before treatment and monitoring during therapy are recommended.

Increases in serum transaminases are also seen in the majority of patients during treatment. ALT/AST levels often rise threefold to fourfold above the upper limit of normal[.42](#page-7-23) Renal tubular acidosis and acute renal failure associated with SbV have been reported. SSG causes lymphopenia that has been associated with occasional cases of herpes zoster occurring during/soon after antimonial treatment.[45](#page-7-25)

Electrocardiographic (ECG) abnormalities, including nonspecific ST- and T-wave changes and T-wave flattening or inversion, occur in more than half of patients receiving SSG[.42,46](#page-7-23) Torsades de pointes with prolonged QT intervals and syncopal episodes have been reported. An ECG should be obtained before therapy and repeated weekly for standard doses. Treatment should be suspended if the corrected QT interval becomes prolonged beyond 0.50 second. T-wave flattening or inversion, the most common ECG abnormality during antimony administration, is not an indication to stop treatment[.47](#page-7-26)

SbV is contraindicated during pregnancy[.48–50](#page-7-27)

## Amphotericin B

Amphotericin B deoxycholate was introduced in the 1990s to treat cases of VL that failed to respond to SbV. One regimen is 1 mg/ kg administered by slow intravenous infusion over 4 to 6 hours every 1 to 2 days, until a total dose of about 20 mg/kg has been given.[51](#page-7-28) The widespread use of amphotericin B deoxycholate has been hindered because of the well-known infusion-related side effects of fever, chills, and thrombophlebitis; long-term problems of renal insufficiency, anemia, and hypokalemia; and poor tolerability (anorexia, nausea)—as well as that it needs to be administered intravenously. Sudden cardiac death has been reported after the first dose of amphotericin B deoxycholate in patients who have recently received SbV. The ECG abnormalities associated with SbV therapy may predispose to cardiac events[.52](#page-7-29) We recommend that a baseline ECG be obtained, a rest period 10 to 14 days after the end of SbV therapy be observed until the ECG normalizes, and any electrolyte abnormalities be corrected before starting amphotericin B.

Lipid-associated amphotericin B—less toxic and more effective preparations—were introduced in the mid-1990s. Liposomal amphotericin B (L-amB, AmBisome, Astellas Pharma US, Inc., USA) was approved by the FDA for the treatment of VL[.53,54](#page-7-30)

L-amB has been shown in a series of trials to be an effective and safe drug for the treatment of VL acquired in Brazil, India, Kenya, and the Mediterranean.[30,55–57](#page-0-1) The current FDA-approved regimen for immunocompetent patients is 3 mg/kg daily on days 1 to 5, a sixth dose on day 14, and a seventh dose on day 21 (total dose with this regimen is 21 mg/kg). The overall success rate with this dose regimen is >90%, except in East Africa, where higher doses (up to 50 mg/kg) may be needed[.58–62](#page-8-0) Indian investigators have shown that a single 10-mg/kg dose of L-amB was >95% efficacious for *L. donovani* infection[.57](#page-8-1) Lower-dose regimens may have a somewhat lower efficacy than the higher-dose regimen, but the cost savings and decreased potential for infusion-related side effects may make a lower-dose regimen optimal for some geographic regions.

The current FDA-approved regimen for immunosuppressed patients is a higher-dose regimen of 4 mg/kg daily on days 1 to 5, 10, 17, 24, 31, and 38 (total dose of 40 mg/kg). Even with the higher total dose, relapse is common in immunocompromised patients—especially persons with AIDS. Secondary prophylaxis should be initiated until the CD4 count is >350/cmm for 6 months. The optimal agent has not been defined, but L-amB 3 mg/kg every 3 weeks, pentamidine 4 mg salt/kg every 2 weeks, or 20 mg SbV/kg every 3 weeks has been used[.63–66](#page-8-2)

## Paromomycin

Paromomycin is an aminoglycoside with broad anti-parasitic activity. Parenteral paromomycin used as monotherapy has been shown to be effective in Indian VL at a dose of 15 mg/kg paromomycin sulfate (110-mg base) given intramuscularly for 21 days for a cure rate of 93% to 95%.[67](#page-8-3) The efficacy was shown to be 85% in East Africa at an increased dose of 20 mg/kg (15-mg base) per day for 21 days.[68](#page-8-4) Mild pain at the injection site is the most common adverse event (55%); reversible ototoxicity occurs in 2% of patients. Occasional elevated hepatic enzyme concentrations and rare renal toxicity and tetany have been reported.

## Miltefosine

Miltefosine has received FDA approval for the treatment of VL due to *L. donovani.* It is given at an oral dose of 2.5 mg/kg per day for 28 days to children aged 2 to 11 years, and for people aged 12 years and above at a dose of 50 mg/day for those weighing <30 kg, 100 mg/day for 30 to 44 kg body weight, and 150 mg/ day for >45 kg body weight for 28 days. Miltefosine has shown a 95% cure rate in immunocompetent patients with VL in India[69,70](#page-8-5) and about 90% in Ethiopia.[71](#page-8-6) Miltefosine should be taken after meals, and if multiple doses are to be taken, they should be divided. It commonly induces gastrointestinal side effects such as anorexia, nausea, vomiting (38%), and diarrhea (20%). Skin allergy, elevated hepatic transaminase concentrations, and, rarely, renal insufficiency may be observed. Miltefosine is potentially teratogenic and should not be used by pregnant women or women with child-bearing potential for whom adequate contraception cannot be assured for the duration of treatment and for 5 months afterward. Regrettably, increasing clinical drug resistance is noted during the treatment of VL in India and Nepal.[72–74](#page-8-7)

## Combination Treatment

Combination treatment has the potential advantages of shortening the duration of treatment, reducing the overall dose of medicines, and reducing the probability of selection of drug-resistant parasites, which will improve compliance, reduce drug toxicities, lower costs, and prolong the effective life of the available medicines. In East Africa, the combination of sodium stibogluconate at 20 mg SbV/ kg plus paromomycin given at 15 mg/kg (11-mg base) for 17 days showed an efficacy of 86% to 93%.[75,76](#page-8-8) In several phase III studies in India, three separate combinations showed 98% to 99% cure rates[.77,78](#page-8-9) The treatment included two sequential administrations with either liposomal amphotericin B (5 mg/kg, single infusion) plus 7 days of miltefosine (dosage as noted earlier) or liposomal amphotericin B (5 mg/kg, single infusion) plus 10 days of paromomycin (11-mg/kg base) and co-administration of 10 days' miltefosine plus 10 days of paromomycin (dose as noted earlier).

## **Treatment of Relapses**

Relapse is suggested by an increase in spleen size, a fall in hemoglobin levels, and a decrease in eosinophil counts to fewer than 50/mm3 ; this should be confirmed by the demonstration of parasites. Relapses are most common during the first 2 to 6 months after finishing treatment; occasionally they occur several years later, particularly in patients who become immunocompromised by disease or medication. Persistent splenomegaly and thrombocytopenia are useful prognostic indicators. Patients who fail to respond or relapse after initial therapy should be treated with a different drug regimen. For example, if a patient with VL fails to respond to liposomal amphotericin B, then a trial of SbV or miltefosine could begin. Additional doses or higher doses of the same regimen could be tried, but only under close supervision.

## **Post–Kala-Azar Dermal Leishmaniasis**

Treatment of PKDL depends on the severity of the condition in individual patients. In Bangladesh, India, and Nepal either an extended regimen of amphotericin B deoxycholate at 1 mg/kg per day by infusion (20 days on, 20 days off), up to 60 to 80 doses over 4 months or miltefosine orally at 50 mg three times daily for 60 days or twice daily for 90 days for 12 weeks is recommended.[79,80](#page-8-10) Disappearance of the lesion is considered clinical cure. Shorter course L-amB administered as five biweekly 3-mg/ kg doses (total 15 mg/kg) in Bangladesh was associated with 78% complete cure[.81](#page-8-11) Miltefosine 100 mg/day for 12 weeks was associated with a 93% per protocol cure rate[.82](#page-8-12) In East Africa, PKDL is not routinely treated, as the majority of cases (85%) heal spontaneously within a year; only patients with severe or disfiguring disease, those with lesions that have remained for longer than 6 months, those with concomitant anterior uveitis, and young children with oral lesions that interfere with feeding are treated. Treatment with either SSG at 20 mg SbV/kg and paromomycin 15 mg sulfate/ kg/day per day for up to 17 days or a 20-day course of L-amB at 2.5 mg/kg per day is recommended in East Africa.[83](#page-8-13) Clinical cure is defined as flattening of lesions and improvement of dyschromia, although pigmentary changes may persist indefinitely.

## **HIV Co-Infection**

Systematic review of data for treatment of HIV-associated VL suggests that L-amB is preferred to the pentavalent antimonial drugs (mainly due to less toxicity); little data on miltefosine in HIV coinfection are published[.84–87](#page-8-14) The optimal induction therapeutic regimen, including choice of drug, dose, and duration for different infecting parasites, is not known. Currently, immune system reconstitution through HAART is the optimal therapy, where feasible. It is reasonable to recommend an initial course of induction therapy using L-amB (using the higher immunosuppressed dosing, plus miltefosine in East Africa) to decrease the parasite burden, closely followed by HAART to raise the CD4 cell count, using secondary prophylaxis until the CD4 count is greater than 350/mm3 .

## **Pregnancy**

Treatment of pregnant women is always a risk–benefit assessment. The possibility of a fatal outcome of leishmaniasis for the mother, the fetus, and the newborn is much greater than the risk for adverse drug effects. When untreated, spontaneous abortion, small-for-birth date, and CL have been described[.88](#page-8-15) SbV and miltefosine should not be used in pregnancy[.49,80](#page-7-31) Miltefosine is potentially embryotoxic and teratogenic and should not be used during pregnancy. Amphotericin B deoxycholate and L-amB are the best therapeutic options for VL. No abortions or vertical transmission has been reported in mothers treated with L-amB.[49,89](#page-7-31)

## **PROGNOSIS**

Infection with *L. donovani* comprises a spectrum of diseases, and spontaneous cure of inapparent infection is much more common than was formerly realized. In contrast, the established syndrome of Kala-azar is almost always fatal (90%) in the absence of specific chemotherapy.

## **PREVENTION AND CONTROL**

## **Human Management**

There is no vaccine or chemoprophylaxis for protection against leishmaniasis. Standard personal protective measures, such as clothing that covers skin in the evening and night, *N,N*diethyl-meta-toluamide (DEET)–based insect repellents, and permethrin or other insecticides applied to clothing and bed nets may provide protection against sandfly bites if used correctly. When humans are the reservoir (India and perhaps parts of East Africa), aggressive case management may help interrupt transmission. In countries where VL has been spread among intravenous drug users, needle exchange programs might limit transmission. For transfusion-associated infection, leukodepletion effectively reduces transmission risk[.90](#page-8-16)

## **Post-Kala-Azar Dermal Leishmaniasis**

Patients with PKDL can actively transmit *Leishmania* parasites; if left untreated this may represent a persistent human reservoir responsible for ongoing transmission (see additional comments in the "[General Principles"](#page--1-1) section)[.91](#page-8-17)

## **Reservoir Control**

Zoonotic visceral leishmaniasis (ZVL) caused by *L. infantum* is an important disease of humans and dogs. Transmission among dogs can be maintained by non-sandfly routes, such as congenital and sexual transmission, as well as between dogs by sandfly transmission. Review of intervention studies examining the effectiveness of current control methods highlights the lack of randomized controlled trials of both dog culling and residual insecticide spraying. Topical insecticides (deltamethrin-impregnated collars and pour-ons) have been shown to provide a high level of individual protection to treated dogs, but further community-level studies are needed[.92](#page-8-18)

## **Vector Control**

During the malaria eradication campaigns, VL virtually disappeared from India, but when spraying of dichlorodiphenyltrichloroethane (DDT) was stopped, the incidence of VL increased to high levels. A recent review suggested that there is not enough evidence to determine whether indoor residual spraying is advantageous[.93](#page-8-19)

## **Vaccines**

A variety of vaccine preparations, including killed promastigotes with and without adjuvants, parasite fractions, recombinant antigens, and genetically engineered "attenuated" live parasites have been evaluated without success or are in clinical trials. Most recently a novel adenoviral-based vaccine for VL or PKDL engineered to elicit a CD8 T-cell response and incorporating two *Leishmania* antigens, KMP-11 and HASPB, has completed a first-in-human trial and is now enrolling for use in PKDL[.94](#page-8-20) No vaccines are licensed or commercially available at this time.[95](#page-8-21)
