# **<sup>120</sup> 120** Toxocariasis

*Edward T. Ryan*

#### KEY FEATURES

- • Toxocariasis is a dead-end human zoonotic infection caused by the dog or cat ascarid roundworms *Toxocara canis* and *cati,* respectively.
- • Human toxocariasis is usually seen among young children with exposure to dogs, cats, and their feces.
- • Clinically active disease usually manifests as visceral toxocariasis (visceral larva migrans; VLM) or ocular toxocariasis (ocular larva migrans; OLM).
- • Diagnosis rests on clinical recognition and serology.
- • Treatment involves albendazole and steroids.
- • Prevention involves limiting geophagia and fecal–oral transmission.

## **NATURAL HISTORY, PATHOGENESIS, AND PATHOLOGY**

*Toxocara canis* and *T. cati* are ascarid roundworms of dogs and cats, respectively[.1](#page-2-0) Animals can ingest eggs from the environment and become infected ([Fig. 120.1\)](#page-1-0). Kittens and puppies can also become infected prenatally or early postnatally. In addition, puppies can become infected transplacentally. Adult *Toxocara* worms eventually reside in the intestine of dogs and cats, and unembryonated eggs are passed into the environment, where over a 2- to 4-week period, the eggs embryonate to contain an infectious larva that can be ingested directly by dogs and cats, or ingested by paratenic hosts such as rabbits that can then be ingested by dogs and cats. Humans represent a dead-end host in which they ingest infectious eggs and *Toxocara* larvae enter into tissues and cause an inflammatory response. Humans can also become infected by eating undercooked meat (such as rabbit) that contains infectious larvae.

After ingestion of embryonated eggs, the egg shell is digested and the larva escapes. Larvae enter into the vascular system and can spread systemically, burrowing into tissues and causing focal hemorrhagic necrosis and secondary inflammation. Larvae have been found in every tissue and organ system. Eventually granulomas form with a preponderance of eosinophils. Fibrosis and calcifications can result. *Toxocara* larvae can survive for years, despite the vigorous immunologic response.

#### **EPIDEMIOLOGY**

Toxocariasis is a worldwide infection. Seroprevalence studies suggest a wide range of antibody positivity from 4% to almost 90%; however, a positive serologic test does not necessarily indicate active clinical disease. Seropositivity correlates with socioeconomic status and dog and cat exposure. Children account for the vast majority of individuals diagnosed with active clinical disease. Playgrounds and sandboxes are common sources of exposure to *Toxocara* eggs.

#### **CLINICAL FEATURES**

Clinical manifestations can usually be categorized as visceral toxocariasis (visceral larva migrans; VLM) or ocular toxocariasis (ocular larva migrans; OLM).

Visceral toxocariasis usually occurs in young children, perhaps reflecting their propensity to ingest larger amounts of dirt (geophagia) or to place their hands in their mouth after contamination with environmental samples or fomites that contain infectious eggs. The mean age of visceral toxocariasis in humans is 2 to 4 years of age. Clinical manifestations reflect a marked inflammatory response to numerous migrating larvae throughout tissues, especially the liver. Affected children usually present with fever, abdominal pain, and hepatomegaly[.2,3](#page-2-1) Coughing, wheezing, and pulmonary infiltrates may be present. Seizures have also been described. The myocardium and central nervous system (CNS) can also be involved, and such involvement may result in death.[4,5](#page-2-2)

Ocular toxocariasis tends to occur in older children and adults, with a mean age of 7 to 17 years.[6](#page-2-3) It is thought that this older age may in part reflect a lower ingestion burden, with an inflammatory response that can occur anywhere in the body but may be most likely to be clinically diagnosed if it involves the eye. Ocular disease is usually unilateral and posterior, and represents an inflammatory and/or granulomatous response of the choroid retina that reflects a prominent immune response to a migrating larva ([Fig. 120.2](#page-1-1)). Affected individuals may present with red eyes, strabismus, eye pain, photophobia, vision changes, or endophthalmitis. Affected individuals may also present with a field defect when the peripheral orbital area is involved, or significant visual loss if the area of the fovea is involved. Clinically inapparent infections may be incidentally noticed by the unilateral absence of a red reflex on photographic imaging in the affected eye.

#### **LABORATORY FINDINGS**

Active visceral toxocariasis is often associated with peripheral eosinophilia that may be quite prominent. Peripheral eosinophilia is usually absent in ocular toxocariasis.

#### **DIAGNOSIS**

Diagnosis is usually based on recognition of the clinical entities in the setting of appropriate epidemiology. Supportive evidence is usually based on serologic analysis. Enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) based on excretory-secretory antigens from infective-stage larvae is the usual diagnostic test of choice. Toxocariasis antibodies can remain elevated for years, so a fourfold change or a one-time positive result in the appropriate clinical setting is usually required for a presumptive diagnosis of active toxocariasis. In some locations, an immunoblot is also available[.7](#page-2-4) Serology is less sensitive for OLM than VLM.

#### **Differential Diagnosis**

Hepatic capillariasis can present in a similar manner to toxocariasis, with involvement of the liver, hepatomegaly and eosinophilia, and abnormal liver function tests. Acute schistosomiasis (Katayama's fever) can also present with hepatosplenomegaly, high-level peripheral eosinophilia, and wheezing. Ocular toxocariasis needs to be distinguished from retinoblastoma.

#### **TREATMENT**

Treatment of individuals with visceral toxocariasis is largely supportive. Albendazole and mebendazole have been used in the

treatment of adults and children, in treatment courses of 5 to 20 days.[8](#page-2-5) Corticosteroids are often used if there is severe disease, including pulmonary, myocardial, or CNS involvement.

Treatment of ocular toxocariasis is usually based on limiting the inflammatory response to lessen the likelihood of vision loss and retinal detachment.[9](#page-2-6) Corticosteroids (systemic, intraocular, or topical) are usually prescribed by treating ophthalmologists. The benefit of anti-helminthic therapy is controversial due to the theoretical fear of increasing the inflammatory response; however, albendazole has been safely administered with concomitant steroids. Ophthalmic interventions, including laser treatments, scleral buckling, and vitrectomies, may also be required.

Incidental noting of a positive antibody in an asymptomatic individual does not warrant treatment.

### **PREVENTION**

Efforts to limit geophagia and exposure of young children to environmental areas contaminated by dog and cat feces are the predominant prevention steps. To limit exposure to *Toxocara* eggs, many playgrounds, daycares, and schools have either removed sandboxes or placed fences and night tarps to limit the likelihood that animals will use the sandboxes for defecation.
