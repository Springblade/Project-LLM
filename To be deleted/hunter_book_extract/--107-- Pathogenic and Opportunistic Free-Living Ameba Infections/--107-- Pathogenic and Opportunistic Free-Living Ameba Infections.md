*Jennifer R. Cope, Ibne K. Ali, Govinda S. Visvesvara*

### KEY FEATURES

- • *Naegleria fowleri* causes an acute and fulminating primary amebic meningoencephalitis (PAM) in children and adults with a history of recent nasal fresh water exposure and leads to death within 10 days.
- • *Acanthamoeba* spp. cause chronic but fatal granulomatous amebic encephalitis (GAE) and disseminated infections of the skin and other organs in immunocompromised people; they can also cause *Acanthamoeba* keratitis, most frequently in association with contact lenses.
- • *Balamuthia mandrillaris* causes chronic but fatal GAE in both immunocompromised and immunocompetent people.

### **INTRODUCTION**

*Acanthamoeba* spp., *Balamuthia mandrillaris,* and *Naegleria fowleri* are pathogenic and opportunistic free-living amebae (FLA), protozoa that primarily cause central nervous system (CNS) infections in humans associated with extremely high mortality. *Acanthamoeba* spp. and *B. mandrillaris* cause a chronic infection called granulomatous amebic encephalitis (GAE) lasting from weeks to months. GAE can be associated with amebic infection of the skin, lungs, kidney, thyroid, and liver. Cases of GAE occur at any time of the year without relation to seasonality. *Acanthamoeba* can also cause keratitis. *N. fowleri* causes an acute and fulminating infection called primary amebic meningoencephalitis (PAM) leading to death within 7 to 10 days. PAM usually occurs during the summer months when the ambient temperature is high.[1–3](#page-6-0) *Sappinia pedata* (previously identified as *S. diploidea*), a saprophytic ameba normally isolated from soil contaminated with fecal material of lizards, elk, and bison, was identified in a brain biopsy specimen of a previously healthy 38-year-old man who developed meningoencephalitis, suggesting that other FLA besides *Acanthamoeba, Balamuthia,* and *Naegleria* spp. may also cause human disease.[2,4,5](#page-6-1)

#### **HISTORY**

The concept that FLA, particularly *Acanthamoeba* spp., may cause human disease was developed by C. G. Culbertson in 1958 when he isolated an ameba from a control monkey kidney cell culture used during the development of polio vaccine. This ameba, now called *Acanthamoeba culbertsoni,* produced meningoencephalitis in cortisone-treated monkeys and mice upon intranasal instillation[.1–3](#page-6-0) The first documented human cases were reported by Fowler and Carter in 1965[.6](#page-6-2)

#### **Life Cycles of Free-Living Ameba and Morphology**

The life cycle of *Acanthamoeba* spp. consists of two stages: a trophozoite stage and a resistant cyst ([Fig. 107.1\)](#page-1-0). The trophozoite measures 15 to 45 µm and is uninucleate with a centrally placed, large, densely staining nucleolus (see [https://www.cdc.gov/dpdx/](https://www.cdc.gov/dpdx/freelivingamebic/index.html)

[freelivingamebic/index.html](https://www.cdc.gov/dpdx/freelivingamebic/index.html) for images). The free-living trophozoite feeds on bacteria and environmental organic debris. Cysts measure 10 to 25 µm and are uninucleate and double-walled: the outer wall (the ectocyst) is wrinkled and contains protein; the inner wall (the endocyst) is usually stellate, polygonal, oval, or spherical and contains cellulose. Pores covered by opercula are present at the point of contact between the ectocyst and the endocyst[.1–3](#page-6-0) Both trophozoite and cyst stages are presumed to be capable of causing human infection.

*B. mandrillaris,* previously called leptomyxid ameba, also has two stages in its life cycle [\(Fig. 107.2](#page-1-1)). The trophozoite is irregular in shape, uninucleate, and measures from 12 to 60 µm. The nucleus contains a large, centrally placed nucleolus. Occasionally, in infected human tissues, trophic stages containing a large nucleus with two or three nucleoli are seen (which helps differentiate it from *Acanthamoeba*). Cysts are uninucleate, more or less spherical, range in size from 12 to 30 µm, and appear to be double-walled with a wavy ectocyst and a spherical endocyst under light microscopy. Ultrastructurally, the cysts are tripartite with an outer thin, irregular ectocyst; an inner thick endocyst; and a middle amorphous fibrillar mesocyst.[2](#page-6-1)

*N. fowleri* has three stages in its life cycle: a trophozoite, a cyst, and a flagellated form ([Fig. 107.3](#page-2-0)). Thus it is also described as an ameboflagellate. *Naegleria* differentiates into this pear-shaped biflagellate stage in response to sudden changes in the ionic concentration of the environment. The trophozoite measures 10 to 25 µm and is uninucleate; the nucleus is spherical and contains a large, centrally placed, dense nucleolus. Cysts are round, measure 7 to 14 µm, and contain a single nucleus with a central dense nucleolus; the dense cyst walls are plugged with one or more flat pores.[1,2](#page-6-0)

*Acanthamoeba* spp. and *N. fowleri,* but not *B. mandrillaris,* can be cultivated on non-nutrient agar plates coated with suitable gramnegative bacteria such as *Escherichia coli* or *Enterobacter aerogenes.* The amebae will feed on the bacteria, multiply, and differentiate into cysts within a few days. All three amebae can be grown axenically without bacteria, as well as on mammalian cell cultures[.1–3](#page-6-0)

#### **EPIDEMIOLOGY**

Pathogenic FLA are presumed to be ubiquitous in the environment, and infections occur worldwide. *Acanthamoeba* spp. and *N. fowleri* have been isolated from a wide range of aquatic and environmental niches, as well as from dust in the air. Typically, PAM caused by *N. fowleri* occurs in young, predominantly male, people who have recent exposure to warm freshwater through swimming, diving, or other water activities that allow water to go up the nose. Recently PAM cases have been reported in the United States that had exposure to tap water used for nasal rinsing and a home water slide.[7,8](#page-6-3) Despite *Naegleria* being commonly found in the environment, only zero to eight cases of PAM are reported in the United States annually, usually during the warm summer months of the year. *B. mandrillaris* has been isolated from the soil, but its exact ecologic niche and epidemiologic risk factors have been difficult to identify, given its unknown incubation period and how common soil exposure is in the general population. Some cases in the United States are associated with occupations and hobbies with frequent soil exposure, such as gardening, landscaping, horseback riding,

and ranching. In recent years, three clusters of *B. mandrillaris* GAE transmitted through solid organ transplantation have been identified[.9,10](#page-6-4) *B. mandrillaris* causes infection in both immunodeficient and immunocompetent individuals. GAE caused by *Acanthamoeba* spp. usually occurs in chronically ill, debilitated individuals; in immunosuppressed patients, including those who have AIDS; or in those who have received chemotherapeutic medications.[1–3](#page-6-0) Approximately 10 to 20 cases of *Balamuthia* and *Acanthamoeba* GAE are reported annually in the United States. *Acanthamoeba* spp. can harbor pathogenic microorganisms such as *Legionella* spp., *Mycobacteria, Francisella tularensis, E. coli* O157, *Burkholderia, Parachlamydia,* and mimiviruses and hence may be of additional public health importance.[1–3](#page-6-0)

#### **CENTRAL NERVOUS SYSTEM INFECTION**

#### **Primary Amebic Meningoencephalitis**

#### Clinical Presentation

PAM occurs when the ameba enters the body when water is forced into the nose and nasal passages; it penetrates the cribriform plate, reaches the subarachnoid space, then invades the brain parenchyma. The incubation period of PAM varies from 1 to 9 days. PAM is characterized clinically by the sudden onset of headaches, fever, nausea, vomiting, and stiff neck. Nuchal rigidity usually occurs with positive Kernig's and Brudzinski's signs. Other signs and symptoms include abnormalities in taste or smell, cerebellar ataxia, and photophobia. Signs of increased intracranial pressure, lethargy, and confusion ensue, leading to generalized seizures, coma, and death within a week to 10 days.

#### Diagnostic Evaluation

The cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) is characterized by pleocytosis, with predominance of polymorphonuclear leukocytes but with an absence of bacteria. The CSF opening pressure is elevated (100–600 mmHg). Glucose concentration is usually low, but the protein content is elevated, ranging from 100 mg/100 mL to 1000 mg/100 mL. Differentiation of PAM from acute bacterial meningitis is made by recognizing motile amebae in direct wet mount examination of the CSF. Smears of CSF should also be stained with Giemsa or trichrome to detect the characteristic *Naegleria* nuclear morphology.[1,2](#page-6-0) Neuroimaging is non-specific but can include edema, basilar meningeal enhancement, and obliteration of the cisterns around the midbrain and the subarachnoid space.[9](#page-6-4) Many cases have been diagnosed post-mortem based on examination of hematoxylin and eosin (H&E)–stained sections, immunohistochemical tests, and polymerase chain reaction (PCR) assay. A real-time PCR is now routinely used in a few reference laboratories that identifies *N. fowleri* DNA in the CSF within hours, thus greatly facilitating rapid and accurate diagnosis[.10](#page-6-5)

Little information exists on the antibody response to *N. fowleri* infection, probably because most patients die before serum antibodies become detectable. However, in one patient who survived PAM, an antibody titer of 1:4096 to *N. fowleri* was demonstrated by immunofluorescence assay in serum samples obtained at 7, 10, and 42 days of hospitalization.[2](#page-6-1) Low levels of antibodies to *N. fowleri* and other *Naegleria* species in sera of hospitalized patients and in apparently healthy people have been reported.

#### Pathologic Features

At autopsy, the cerebral hemispheres are swollen and edematous. The olfactory bulbs and the orbitofrontal cortices are necrotic and hemorrhagic. The arachnoid membrane is severely congested with scant purulent exudate. Amebic trophozoites, but not cysts, are usually seen within the Virchow–Robin spaces with minimal or no inflammatory reaction ([Fig. 107.4](#page-3-3))[.1,2](#page-6-0)

#### Management

The few patients who have survived this infection have done so primarily because of early diagnosis, administration of multiple drugs active against *N. fowleri,* and aggressive management of elevated intracranial pressure. Recent survivors were treated with intravenous and intrathecal conventional amphotericin B, fluconazole, rifampin, azithromycin, and miltefosine ([Table 107.1](#page-3-4)). Hyperosmolar therapy, drainage of CSF, and therapeutic hypothermia were used to manage intracranial pressure[.11,12](#page-6-6)

## Prevention

The trophic and the cyst forms of *N. fowleri* are susceptible to chemical disinfectants (e.g., chlorine). It is therefore important for swimming pools and drinking water systems to be maintained properly with adequate disinfectant levels at all times.[1,2](#page-6-0) It is advisable to use previously boiled water for ritual rinsing and sinus irrigation. Swimmers should consider using a nose clip or not submerging their heads under water when ambient and/or water temperatures are high.

#### **Granulomatous Amebic Encephalitis**

#### Clinical Presentation

GAE can be caused by *Acanthamoeba* spp*.* or *B. mandrillaris* infection.[2](#page-6-1) GAE is an insidious disease and can have a long and protracted clinical course lasting weeks, months, or even years although some

cases have presented more acutely. Clinical signs can progress from personality changes, headache, low-grade fever, nausea and vomiting, to lethargy, diplopia, hemiparesis, seizures, depressed levels of consciousness, and coma. Third and sixth cranial nerve palsies may be seen in some patients. GAE may mimic bacterial leptomeningitis, tuberculous or viral meningitis, or single or multiple space-occupying lesions.

#### Diagnostic Evaluation

CSF in patients with GAE reveals a lymphocytic pleocytosis, red blood cells, and elevated protein and normal to low levels of

glucose. CSF in patients with GAE, unlike PAM patients, often contains no amebic DNA to be detected by real-time PCR. Neuroimaging studies can reveal single or multiple heterogeneous, hypodense lesions, some with evidence of intralesional hemorrhage ([Fig. 107.5](#page-4-0)). Lesions can involve the basal ganglia, cerebral cortex, subcortical white matter, cerebellum and pons, suggesting abscess, tumor, or intracerebral hematoma. Brain and skin biopsies (if lesions are present, see later) are important diagnostic procedures. In *B. mandrillaris* infection foamy macrophages and multinucleated giant cells may be seen. Molecular techniques such as real-time PCR are used to identify *Acanthamoeba* and *Balamuthia* in the skin, brain, and corneal tissue. *Acanthamoeba* spp. can be cultured from infected tissue on bacterially seeded agar plates[.1–3](#page-6-0) *B. mandrillaris* can be isolated from the CNS by inoculating monkey kidney cell culture with brain tissue[.2](#page-6-1)

#### Pathologic Features

The cerebral hemispheres are edematous. Encephalomalacia with multifocal areas of cortical softening and hemorrhagic necrosis may be seen (see pathology at [https://www.cdc.gov/dpdx/](https://www.cdc.gov/dpdx/freelivingamebic/index.html) [freelivingamebic/index.html](https://www.cdc.gov/dpdx/freelivingamebic/index.html)). Multifocal necrotic lesions often accompanied by *Acanthamoeba* trophozoites and cysts [\(Fig. 107.6](#page-4-1)) may also be seen in the posterior fossa structures, midbrain, thalamus, brainstem, and cerebellum. Occasionally, angiitis may be seen with perivascular cuffing by inflammatory cells, chiefly lymphocytes, a few plasma cells, and macrophages. Histopathologically, *B. mandrillaris* can be differentiated from *Acanthamoeba* because the nucleus of *B. mandrillaris* sometimes contains multiple nucleoli ([Fig. 107.7](#page-5-0)). Immunohistochemical analysis using rabbit anti-*Acanthamoeba* spp. or anti-*B. mandrillaris* sera can also differentiate the two amebae.[1–3](#page-6-0) Real-time PCR can also differentiate the two species, and it is most effective when the tissue has not been treated with formalin.

Ulcerations of the skin with acute and chronic inflammation and trophozoites and cysts may be seen. The kidneys, prostate gland, adrenal glands, lungs, and liver may also be involved, suggesting hematogenous dissemination.

#### Management

There is no effective treatment for GAE, and therefore the prognosis is poor. Diagnosis of GAE is often made post-mortem. A few patients diagnosed pre-mortem and a few with cutaneous infections without CNS involvement have been successfully treated

with a combination of antimicrobials, including pentamidine isethionate, sulfadiazine, flucytosine, fluconazole or itraconazole, and miltefosine (see [Table 107.1\)](#page-3-4).[15,16](#page-6-7)

Although the majority of patients with *B. mandrillaris* GAE have died, a few have survived the infection. Notably, two transplant recipients have survived after treatment with a combination of pentamidine isethionate, sulfadiazine, a macrolide (azithromycin or clarithromycin), fluconazole, flucytosine, and miltefosine[.13,14,17](#page-6-8) Two Peruvian patients with cutaneous lesions recovered after prolonged therapy with albendazole and itraconazole[.2](#page-6-1)

#### Prevention

Because *Acanthamoeba* spp. can grow in and colonize hot water tanks, hot tubs, filters used in HVAC units, and in-line filters used for purifying portable water supplies and eye wash stations, periodic inspection and cleaning of these systems is recommended. However, as ubiquitous environmental organisms causing rare infections, there are no proven prevention strategies for *Acanthamoeba* and *Balamuthia* infections.

### *Acanthamoeba* **Keratitis**

*Acanthamoeba* keratitis (AK) is a sight-threatening infection of the cornea caused by amebae introduced by ocular trauma or by contact lens wear with poor hygiene practices. *Acanthamoeba* spp. present in the environment or contaminated lens solution adhere to corneal epithelial cells and secrete proteolytic and collagenolytic enzymes that contribute to the pathogenesis of AK. According to recent studies, the initial process of invasion occurs when a 136-kDa mannose-binding protein, a lectin expressed on the surface of *Acanthamoeba,* adheres to mannose glycoproteins on the surface of the epithelial cells and destroys them[.18](#page-6-9) *Acanthamoeba* trophozoites may also produce "food cups" with which they directly ingest epithelial cells.

The first case of AK in the United States was reported in 1975 in a farmer from south Texas with ocular trauma of the right eye. Subsequently, contact lens use and the use of non-sterile homemade saline solutions were identified as additional risk factors for AK. Studies have identified specific behaviors that put contact lens wearers at higher risk for AK that include "topping off" (adding new solution to an existing volume of old solution in the case), rinsing or storing lenses in tap water, and sleeping in lenses[.19,20](#page-6-10)

The hallmark of AK is severe ocular pain, tearing, photophobia, a central or paracentral 360-degree stromal ring infiltrate, and a recurrent breakdown of corneal epithelium, with a waxing and waning clinical course. Usually one eye is involved, although it may be bilateral in presentation. The lesion is refractory to the usual anti-bacterial, anti-viral, and anti-mycotic medications with which it is often presumptively treated. If proper treatment is not provided, AK may lead to a vascularized scar within a thin cornea, causing impaired vision or perforation of the cornea and loss of the eye.[2,3,18](#page-6-1)Use of topical steroids is controversial in the treatment of AK, but may play a role in some cases.

#### Diagnostic Microbiology

Accurate diagnosis of AK requires deep corneal scrapings and biopsy. Unfixed specimens should be subjected to real-time PCR

<span id="page-5-1"></span>and cultured on bacterially seeded agar plates (as noted earlier). Smears should also be prepared and stained with Giemsa–Wright, Hemacolor, or Wheatly's or Masson's trichrome stain, which help differentiate trophozoites of *Acanthamoeba* spp. from host corneal cells. Confocal microscopy has also been used recently to diagnose AK[.2,3](#page-6-1)

#### Management

Unlike with GAE, successful treatment of AK is feasible, using aggressive topical application of polyhexamethylene biguanide or chlorhexidine gluconate in combination with propamidine isethionate (Brolene) and neomycin[.18](#page-6-9) Debridement of the cornea, penetrating keratoplasty, and corneal grafting have also been performed with good results in some patients. Recurrence of AK has been reported after corneal transplantation because of persistence of *Acanthamoeba* cysts in the corneal stroma[.18](#page-6-9)

#### Prevention

Eye care professionals need to educate patients about the proper care and use of contact lenses (see [https://www.cdc.gov/contactlenses/](https://www.cdc.gov/contactlenses/protect-your-eyes.html) [protect-your-eyes.html\)](https://www.cdc.gov/contactlenses/protect-your-eyes.html). Contact lenses and contact lens supplies should be kept meticulously clean. Contact lens wearers should follow the directions and recommendations of the manufacturers and eye care professionals. Contact lens use should be avoided during swimming or other water sports.

#### *Acanthamoeba* **and** *Balamuthia* **Skin Infections**

*B. mandrillaris* may present as a cutaneous lesion with or without CNS involvement. The lesion is usually not ulcerated, usually one to several centimeters in size, asymptomatic, and often associated with prior trauma. The central face is a common location ([Fig. 107.8](#page-5-1)).

*Acanthamoeba* skin lesions occur most often in immunosuppressed hosts. They are often on the lower extremities and start out as papules or nodules and then go on to develop into necrotic ulcerations. On skin biopsy there is intense histiocytic inflammation in the dermis and trophozoites are present.
