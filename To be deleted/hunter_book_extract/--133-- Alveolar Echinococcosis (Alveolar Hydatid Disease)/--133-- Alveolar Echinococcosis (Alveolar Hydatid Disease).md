# **133** Alveolar Echinococcosis (Alveolar Hydatid Disease)

*Christina M. Coyle, Thomas Junghanss*

#### KEY FEATURES

- • *Echinococcosis multilocularis* is a zoonotic parasitic disease principally transmitted between the definitive host harboring the tapeworm (foxes and, to a lesser extent, domestic dogs) and the intermediate hosts, predominantly rodents, that harbor the larval form.
- • Human alveolar echinococcosis (AE) is endemic in most parts of the Northern Hemisphere: central and eastern Europe, much of Russia, the Central Asian republics, western China, northern Canada, and Alaska.
- • The liver is the primary organ invaded by the larval form of *E. multilocularis,* with local extension and metastases, mostly to lungs and brain, in advanced disease.
- • Ultrasonography (US), magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), and computed tomography (CT) can identify AE lesions; purified *E. multilocularis* antigens are specific and may discriminate between infections of *E. multilocularis* and *E. granulosus.*
- • Treatment options include surgery, endoscopic procedures, anti-helminthic agents, and liver transplantation for advanced cases.
- • Contact with dog and fox feces in areas where the infection is endemic must be avoided. Exposed dogs should receive monthly treatments with praziquantel.

#### **INTRODUCTION**

Human alveolar echinococcosis (AE) is infection by the larval (metacestode) stage of the tapeworm *Echinococcus multilocularis.*

#### **EPIDEMIOLOGY**

AE has been reported in most of central and, more recently, northern Europe; much of Russia; the Central Asian republics; northeastern, northwestern, and western China; the northwestern portion of Canada; and western Alaska.[1–3](#page-2-0) It is emerging in previously nonendemic parts of Europe and Asia. Urban areas are becoming colonized by infected foxes[.1–4](#page-2-0) Northern Turkey and China are highly endemic[.1,2](#page-2-0) In central China some communities report 5% or more of the population infected—the high prevalence may be due to semi-domestic transmission of *E. multilocularis* between wild rodents and dogs.[1–3,5](#page-2-0) In Russia, Siberia reports large numbers of human cases, whereas elsewhere in Russia disease is sporadic. The United States and Canada are endemic for *E. multilocularis;* however, there is very little transmission to man. There have been reports of high incidence in Alaska in Native American communities, but only locally, and these have been eliminated by interventions[.6](#page-2-1)

## **NATURAL HISTORY, PATHOGENESIS, AND PATHOLOGY**

Transmission of AE to humans is by consumption of parasite eggs that are excreted in the feces of the definitive host: foxes and to a lesser extent dogs are the definitive host in certain regions[.7](#page-2-2) Small mammals, mainly rodents, act as natural intermediate hosts; humans are incidental intermediate hosts. Human infection can occur through direct contact with the definitive host or indirectly through contamination of food, the fur and mouths of domestic dogs, or possibly water containing parasite eggs.[1](#page-2-0) The embryo or oncosphere hatches from the egg in the small intestine and is transported to the liver, where it forms multilocular cysts. Unlike cystic echinococcosis, protoscolices are rarely observed in human infections. The parasitic tissue is surrounded by an intense fibroinflammatory reaction that does not have defined limits with the adjacent liver parenchyma. At the periphery are active parasitic vesicles. Both the biliary and vascular walls may be involved in the parasitic process. Large lesions necrotize in the center, forming pseudocysts, which can be mistaken for CE, with disastrous consequences. On gross examination these larger lesions consist of a central necrotic cavity filled with white amorphous material covered with a thin peripheral layer of dense fibrous tissue.[8](#page-2-3) The larval mass resembles a malignancy in appearance and behavior because it proliferates indefinitely by exogenous budding and invades the surrounding tissues[.9](#page-2-4)

Improvements in the treatment of AE in the last 30 years have had a positive impact on the life expectancy of patients[.10](#page-2-5)

## **CLINICAL FEATURES**

AE patients often become symptomatic when complications of advanced disease occur. AE lesions of the liver are rarely incidental findings. In both humans and natural intermediate hosts, the liver is the primary organ affected[.1,3,11](#page-2-0) The lesion extends locally and can metastasize in advanced disease. Areas of calcification can exist within the lesion, as well as extensive infiltration by proliferating vesicles. Of 559 patients reported to the European registry between 1982 and 2000, in 190 (34%) the disease had already spread by continuous growth to adjacent organs, most frequently the diaphragm, kidneys, adrenal glands, lungs, and pleura, with spread mainly to the brain or spleen[.11](#page-2-6) This underscores the importance of a meticulous workup before deciding on therapy.

The initial symptoms of AE are often vague and include upper quadrant and epigastric pain, jaundice, hepatomegaly, sometimes fever and anemia, weight loss, and pleural pain. Later hepatic dysfunction occurs and is often associated with portal hypertension[.12](#page-2-7) In 117 patients with progressive AE of the liver in eastern France, clinical complications included cholangitis, liver abscess, ascites, pulmonary embolism, pulmonary or brain metastases, inferior vena cava thrombosis, and Budd–Chiari syndrome due to hepatic vein infiltration[.13](#page-2-8) The main cause of death was hepatic failure, cerebral AE, gastrointestinal bleeding, septic shock, or complications after liver transplantation[.13](#page-2-8)

## **PATIENT EVALUATION, DIAGNOSIS, AND DIFFERENTIAL DIAGNOSIS**

Imaging is the cornerstone of diagnosis: ultrasound (US), magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), computerized tomography (CT), and positron emission tomography (PET-CT), with US and MRI the methods of choice. On US, AE lesions have irregular limits and

A PNM classification of AE reflecting an approach to malignancy is used to decide on therapy. The P represents a *primary* mass in the liver; N is involvement of *neighboring* organs, including lymph nodes; and M is for *metastasis*. [8](#page-2-4) MRI is used to determine extension of the parasitic mass to adjacent structures and should be included in pre-operative evaluations. Disappearance of the microvesicular structure in AE lesions on MRI indicates response to therapy.

AE has to be distinguished from primary hepatic and metastatic malignancies, as well as benign hepatic lesions (i.e., hemangioma and cystademonas). In the case of necrotic or AE pseudocysts, the differential diagnosis includes bacterial and amebic abscess as well as cystic echinococcosis ([Figs. 133.1](#page-1-0) and [133.2\)](#page-1-1). In a retrospective cases series of 80 patients with AE, the diagnosis in 26 was confused with CE or cholangiocellular carcinoma. Infiltrative AE was more commonly confused with malignancy, and pseudocystic AE was mistaken for CE. Eight cases mistaken for CE underwent instillation of a protoscolicidal agent, developed toxic cholangitis and liver failure, and had to undergo liver transplantation. Misdiagnosis can lead to delay in therapy, inappropriate surgical interventions, and exposure to protoscolicidal agents[.15](#page-2-10)

Serology has a confirmatory role in lesions suspicious for AE. Purified and recombinant *E. multilocularis* antigens (e.g., Em2, Em2+, Em18) exhibit high diagnostic sensitivity and specificity and can differentiate between AE and CE.[16,17](#page-2-11) Immunoblotting is used in most labs as a confirmatory test. The Em-18 enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay in combination with PET-CT imaging and/ or MRI is valuable in assessing the efficacy of treatment.

## <span id="page-1-1"></span>**TREATMENT**

AE has the features of malignancy and should be approached in a similar manner. The workup must include imaging (US, MRI) to investigate the interface between the lesion and surrounding tissue and to rule out distant metastases. Currently, curative surgery accompanied by 2 years of benzimidazoles (albendazole) is recommended if resection of the lesion, including a 2-cm margin of healthy liver tissue, is possible.[8,18](#page-2-4) In addition to imaging, anti-Em18 or anti-EM2+ antibodies are useful in following a patient[.19,20](#page-2-12) Recurrences have occurred up to 20 years after surgery; therefore lifelong follow-up is recommended. It is recommended that in the first 10 years, follow-up is yearly and then at 2- to 3-year intervals.

Lifelong therapy with albendazole is recommended for patients with advanced disease. Debulking surgery with albendazole does not offer any benefit in this setting[.21](#page-2-13) Albendazole is preferred over mebendazole due to its better bioavailability. The recommended albendazole dose is 10 to 15 mg/kg per day in two divided doses mornings and evenings. It needs to be taken with a fatty meal, and albendazole sulfoxide levels monitored 4 hours after the morning dose. Side effects are mostly transient abdominal discomfort when treatment is initiated, (reversible) hair loss, and, more importantly, toxic hepatitis and agranulocytosis, the latter occurring very rarely. Liver function tests and white blood cells need to be done at days 0, 5, 10, and 30 when albendazole is introduced, thereafter every 2 weeks and then stretched to monthly, every 3 months, and every 6 months if the patient is doing well. Discontinuing albendazole treatment after years to decades in selected patients is being evaluated in AE treatment centers[.22](#page-2-14) Liver transplantation should only be considered as a last resort in the very late stages of the disease; recurrence rates are high after liver transplantation.[23,24](#page-2-15)

Involvement of the biliary tree is common in advanced disease, with biliary obstruction, cholangitis, and various necroses. Substantial progress has been achieved with endoscopic interventions. Balloon dilation of biliary strictures combined with albendazole can re-establish and maintain biliary duct patency.[25](#page-2-16)

#### **PREVENTION**

Eliminating *E. multilocularis* from its wild animal hosts is impractical; therefore contact with fox and dog feces in areas where the infection is endemic must be avoided. This includes fox feces dispersed in the environment and attached to the fur or mouth of domestic dogs. There should be education to improve hygiene and sanitation and monthly treatment of dogs with praziquantel. Persons with a high risk of exposure to AE, such as hunters, may be serologically and ultrasongraphically screened at yearly intervals. Treatment of foxes with anti-helminthic baits has been proven to be effective in reducing the prevalence of infection.[26,27](#page-2-17)
