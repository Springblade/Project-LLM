# **73** Bartonellosis: Carrion's Disease and Other *Bartonella* Infections

*Eloy E. Ordaya, Ciro P. Maguiña*

### KEY FEATURES

- • South American bartonellosis (Carrion's disease) is a bi-phasic bacterial infection caused by *Bartonella bacilliformis.*
- • It is transmitted by a sandfly (*Lutzomyia* spp.) that lives in the highland areas in Peru, Colombia, and Ecuador.
- • Its classic clinical presentation includes two phases: an acute febrile-hemolytic stage (Oroya fever) and a chronic eruptive phase (verruga peruana). Other new *Bartonella* spp. (*B. rochalimae* and *B. ancashensis*) have been diagnosed in patients with similar clinical presentations to Carrion's disease.
- • Oroya fever is a life-threatening condition characterized by fever, pallor, and hemolytic anemia.
- • Verruga peruana is a benign and prolonged stage distinguished by polymorphic skin lesions.
- • A number of other *Bartonella* spp. can cause a variety of other diseases in humans, including cat scratch disease, trench fever, bacillary angiomatosis, and blood culture– negative endocarditis.

#### **INTRODUCTION**

South American bartonellosis, or Carrion's disease, is a bi-phasic infection caused by *Bartonella bacilliformis* and transmitted by sandflies. It is named in memory of Daniel Alcides Carrion, a Peruvian medical student who self-inoculated the discharge from a patient with verruga peruana; Carrion subsequently died after developing the acute febrile-hemolytic phase of the illness. This act demonstrated that both entities were manifestations of the same disease[.1](#page-3-0)

### **EPIDEMIOLOGY**

Carrion's disease is endemic in the inter-Andean valleys (between 500 and 3200 meters above sea level) of Peru, Ecuador, and Colombia. The disease has emerged in new areas in Ecuador and the high forests of Peru between the jungle margins and Altiplano. The expanding distribution is thought to reflect changing weather and climate patterns [\(Fig. 73.1\)](#page-1-0).[2](#page-3-1) Serologic studies suggest that about 60% of people in endemic areas have been infected and 0.5% may have asymptomatic bacteremia[.1](#page-3-0) Bartonellosis affects males and females equally and is more common in children. Pregnant patients can develop severe complications; vertical transmission from mother to fetus has been reported.[3](#page-3-2)

#### **MICROBIOLOGY**

*B. bacilliformis* is a fastidious intracellular, pleomorphic, gramnegative bacterium. Other *Bartonella* species, *B. rochalimae* and *B. ancashensis,* may cause comparable illnesses. *B. rochalimae* was isolated in a tourist with Oroya fever–like syndrome who traveled to different cities in Peru. Subsequently, it was isolated in domestic animals, supporting its potential zoonotic transmission. *B. ancashensis* was identified by molecular testing in two patients with clinical verruga peruana who were enrolled in a clinical trial.[4,5](#page-3-3)

# **NATURAL HISTORY, PATHOGENESIS, AND PATHOLOGY**

Humans are the only known reservoir of *B. bacilliformis. B. bacilliformis* is transmitted by the bite of female New World sandflies, *Lutzomyia* spp. The most effective vector in Peru is *L. verrucarum* that lives in high-altitude river valleys. After inoculation, *B. bacilliformis* infects the endothelium of multiple capillary vessels and then is released to the blood where it invades erythrocytes. This process activates reticular-endothelial cells causing systemic symptoms and hemolysis. If the patient survives, approximately 5% develop the chronic phase of illness. In this stage, the bacterium invades the endothelial cells forming Rocha–Lima inclusion bodies, stimulating endothelial proliferation and angiogenesis. This response leads to formation of hyper-vascular nodules, similar to hemangiomas, called *Peruvian warts*. [6](#page-3-4)

#### **CLINICAL FEATURES**

Carrion's disease is characterized by two sequential clinical stages: a febrile-hemolytic illness (Oroya fever), followed by a verrucous phase (verruga peruana). However, infected individuals may manifest one of these two phases or have other clinical presentations ranging from asymptomatic bacteremia to recurrent verrucous presentations[.7](#page-3-5)

The incubation period for Oroya fever is around 8 weeks, but may range from 10 days to months. Individuals present with fever, myalgia, headaches, and hepatomegaly. Severe pallor and jaundice secondary to hemolytic anemia are common. Pericarditis, encephalopathy, seizures, multi-organ failure, and death can occur. Also, *B. bacilliformis* infection has been described as a trigger for developing systemic vasculitis. Concomitant infectious complications are common, including salmonellosis, toxoplasmosis, histoplasmosis, tuberculosis, leptospirosis, and pneumocystosis. Oroya fever can last for 1 to 4 weeks, and mortality can be as high as 90% in untreated patients and up to 10% in treated patients[.2,8,9](#page-3-1)

Verruga peruana occurs several weeks or months after the acute illness; patients present with arthralgia, fever, and painless eruptive lesions that are commonly located on the face and extremities. There are three types of lesions: miliary (multiple small, reddish papules of 3 mm or less; [Fig. 73.2\)](#page-1-1); mular (ulcerative or nonulcerative angioma-like tumors of more than 5 mm; [Fig. 73.3\)](#page-1-2); and a nodular or sub-dermic form ([Fig. 73.4](#page-2-0)). Uncommonly, verruga can involve the oral, conjunctival, or nasal mucosa. Dermal verrugal lesions usually last from 3 to 6 months and can heal without therapy[.7,10](#page-3-5)

## **PATIENT EVALUATION, DIAGNOSIS, AND DIFFERENTIAL DIAGNOSIS**

Diagnosis of Oroya fever is confirmed by visualization of the intra-erythrocyte bacteria that may appear bacillary or coccoid in

<span id="page-1-1"></span>peripheral blood Giemsa–Wright smear, or by isolation in blood cultures. Peripheral smear is frequently used in endemic areas due to its low cost, but it is insensitive (36%) and may be associated with misdiagnosis. Reliability of the test depends on the ability of the laboratory technician to distinguish the bacteria from artifacts, basophilic stippling, and Howell–Jolly bodies. Blood cultures should be held for up to 6 weeks, and recovery is highest using supplemented Columbia agar incubated at 28°C.[2,10,11](#page-3-1)

Diagnosis of verruga peruana is based on clinical features and confirmed by histopathologic analysis of tissue. Microbiologic testing is insensitive in this stage. Proliferation of endothelial cells, macrophages, and angioblastic proliferation is the hallmark. Warthin–Starry and Giemsa staining permit visualization of the organism dispersed in tissue. Specific immunohistochemical staining has been developed.[12](#page-3-6)

Serologic tests (enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay [ELISA], sonicate immunoblot, and indirect fluorescence assay [IFA]) have shown high sensitivity in acute and chronic disease. Molecular techniques for diagnosis of Oroya fever can improve the diagnosis of patients with low-level bacteremia; however, assay cost and lack of molecular laboratories in endemic areas in Latin America limit its use[.2,13](#page-3-1)

<span id="page-1-2"></span>The differential diagnosis of Oroya fever is broad, as individuals usually present with a non-specific febrile illness. Epidemiologic history and analysis of the potential incubation period are critical, as Carrion's disease is a geographically restricted infection. The presence of hemolytic anemia assists in considering the diagnosis, as well as malaria. The differential diagnosis of verruga peruana usually involves consideration of other nodular skin lesions, although the hyper-vascular nature of verruga peruana assists in establishing the diagnosis [\(Table 73.1](#page-2-1)).

#### **TREATMENT**

In vitro studies have shown that *B. bacilliformis* is more susceptible to penicillins, cephalosporins, tetracyclines, fluoroquinolones, macrolides, rifampin, and chloramphenicol compared with aminoglycosides and carbapenems[.1,14](#page-3-0)

Because of the high rate of co-infection with *Salmonella* spp. during the acute phase, experts recommended ciprofloxacin or chloramphenicol as a front-line therapy [\(Table 73.2\)](#page-2-2). Ciprofloxacin became the therapy of choice as treatment failure and relapses were observed among patients treated with chloramphenicol. Limited observational and in vitro data have suggested intrinsic

resistance and reduced susceptibility to ciprofloxacin among some isolates; therefore for treatment of severe or persistent disease, a combination regimen of ceftriaxone and ciprofloxacin should be considered. Amoxicillin plus clavulanic acid may be used in pregnant women. Blood transfusions are indicated for patients with severe anemia; pericardial effusions may require drainage.[15,16](#page-3-7)

Azithromycin and rifampicin are equally effective for treating patients with verruga peruana, but azithromycin is favored due to its safer side effect profile. Ciprofloxacin and streptomycin are alternatives. Chloramphenicol and β-lactam penicillins are ineffective.[1,17](#page-3-0)

#### **Other** *Bartonella* **Infections**

Beyond *B. bacilliformis,* over a dozen *Bartonella* spp. have been identified as causing diseases in humans, including trench fever (discussed in Chapter 72), cat scratch disease (CSD), bacillary angiomatosis (BA), and blood culture–negative endocarditis (BCNE).

CSD is considered the most common *Bartonella* infection worldwide, affecting more children than adults. *B. henselae* is the main etiologic agent, with felines being its principal reservoir. *B. henselae* is transmitted to cats through fleas (*Ctenocephalides felis*). Human infection occurs after scratches, bites, or licks from infected cats or from the bite of an arthropod vector. CSD may present as a chronic papular, pustular, or ulcerative lesion that precedes a painful, regional lymphadenopathy that usually is self-limited ([Fig. 73.5](#page-3-8)), but 30% of cases present with systemic manifestations, including fever of unknown origin, lymphadenopathy, encephalitis, osteomyelitis, hepatosplenic abscesses, retinitis, and Parinaud's oculoglandular syndrome. Diagnosis is confirmed by IFA; cultures in special medium and histopathology with Warthin–Starry stain can be used. CSD can be treated with azithromycin or doxycycline.[12,18,19](#page-3-6)

BA is a disorder of vascular hyper-proliferation caused by *B. henselae* and *B. quintana.* The typical lesion is a reddish-purple papule, but may be a hyperkeratotic plaque or hyper-vascular nodule. BA is seen in severely immunocompromised patients, especially in patients with AIDS. It can be confined to the skin or involve deep organs such as the liver, causing peliosis hepatis. Diagnosis is confirmed by histopathology using Warthin–Starry or Giemsa stain. Treatment requires prolonged use of a macrolide, either alone or combined with doxycycline[.12,14,20](#page-3-6)

A number of *Bartonella* species can cause BCNE, including *B. alsatica, B. elizabethae, B. koehlerae, B. mayotimonensis,* or *B. vinsonii,*
