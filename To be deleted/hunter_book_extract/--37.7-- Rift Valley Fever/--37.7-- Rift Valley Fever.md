# **37.7** Rift Valley Fever

*Brian H. Bird, Jean-Marc Reynes, Stuart T. Nichol*

#### KEY FEATURES

- • Mosquito-borne viral zoonosis found in Africa and the western Arabian Peninsula.
- • A high-consequence disease of livestock (sheep and cattle); wild ruminants are also affected but to a lesser extent.
- • Contact with sick animals and animal tissues (especially aborted fetuses and fluids) are major risk factors for human infection.
- • Human infections are generally self-limiting but can progress to hepatitis, retinitis, or a hemorrhagic syndrome.
- • Hospitalized case fatality rate can be 10% to 30%; high virus loads are predicti.ve of fatal outcomes.
- • Delayed-onset neurologic signs (confusion, ataxia, seizures, coma) can present 7 to 28 days after resolution of acute illness.

RNA genome. RVFV was first isolated in the 1930s after a large outbreak among sheep in the Rift Valley of Kenya. Today, it is found in over 30 countries where significant outbreaks occur periodically ([Fig. 37.7.1](#page-0-0)). Human infections can result in isolated individual cases or extensive epidemics, with infections numbering tens of thousands. Mosquitoes are the primary vector, although experimental infection of sandflies and ticks has been documented. Humans can be directly infected by mosquito bite or via contact with infected animals (especially livestock) and animal fluids and tissues, including aborted fetuses, amniotic fluids, uncooked meat, and possibly unpasteurized milk[.7](#page-2-4)

The primary target tissue for the virus is the liver. In fatal cases, extensive hepatocellular necrosis is evident with or without focal inflammatory cell infiltrates[.8](#page-2-5) Generally, positive immunostaining for virus antigen can be found in hepatocytes and Kupffer's cells and renal tubular epithelial cells. However, RVFV is promiscuous and can infect a wide variety of cell types and tissues. There are no detailed pathologic descriptions of human Rift Valley fever

#### **INTRODUCTION**

Rift Valley fever virus (RVFV) is a mosquito-borne pathogen of livestock and humans that has historically been responsible for widespread outbreaks of severe livestock and human disease throughout Africa and the western Arabian Peninsula[.1](#page-2-0) Rift Valley fever outbreaks often occur in arid or semi-arid regions after unusually heavy rainfall and flooding, allowing the abundant emergence of mosquito vectors. Hallmarks of Rift Valley fever epizootics/epidemics include extensive losses of livestock due to abortion "storms" and neonatal mortality approaching 100% in sheep and cattle that often go unreported and precede large numbers of human cases.

### **EPIDEMIOLOGY**

RVFV is a notorious cause of illness among herdsmen, veterinarians, and others with direct contact with infected animals, especially during routine slaughtering, veterinary post-mortem, and obstetric procedures. Men and working-aged persons are at greater risk of infection because of higher occupational exposure to livestock and mosquitoes. Wildlife can be affected by the virus, especially wild ruminants, even during interepizootic periods[.2,3](#page-2-1) Although abortion "storms" are a hallmark of livestock infections, human fetal death has not been recognized as significant historically. However in 2016, acute RVFV infection was found to be significantly associated with miscarriage among women in Sudan for the first time[.4](#page-2-2) Vertical transmission of virus to two newborn infants has also been reported[.5,6](#page-2-3) Nosocomial transmission has not been documented, but patients often have high viremias, suggesting that standard droplet barrier nursing techniques and universal blood precautions be followed, especially during invasive procedures or while attending births from infected mothers.

### **NATURAL HISTORY, PATHOGENESIS, AND PATHOLOGY**

The RVFV (family Phenuiviridae*;* genus *Phlebovirus,* species Rift Valley fever phlebovirus) is an enveloped virus with a segmented

neurologic disease. Experimental animal studies suggest that direct neuron infection and cellular infiltrates contribute to the disease process. In hemorrhagic cases, the exact molecular mechanisms causing alterations in vascular permeability are unknown but are likely mediated by secondary cytokine/chemokine perturbations of endothelial cell barrier functions rather than direct virus infection and the cytopathic effect of endothelial cells. Among fatal human cases, RVFV does not appear to widely infect endothelial cells, even in the later stages of the disease, unlike some other hemorrhagic fever viruses (e.g., Ebola, Marburg, Crimean-Congo hemorrhagic fever, and the arenavirus hemorrhagic fevers).[3](#page-2-8)

#### **CLINICAL FEATURES**

After an incubation period of 2 to 6 days, most cases present with abrupt onset of fever, malaise, myalgia, and arthralgia. A high proportion of patients report nausea, vomiting, abdominal pain, and diarrhea; symptoms can clinically resemble other acute viral infections, thus complicating early differential diagnosi[s9](#page-2-9) [\(Fig.](#page-1-2) [37.7.2](#page-1-2), [Table 37.7.1\)](#page-1-3). Upper respiratory signs are notably absent in Rift Valley fever cases. A small percentage of infected individuals (1%–2%) may develop jaundice, hepatitis, and/or a hemorrhagic syndrome. Case fatalities among hospitalized patients with coagulopathy range from 10% to 30%. In some patients, retinitis may develop with potential long-term sequelae including scotomas, other vision abnormalities, or total blindness.[10](#page-2-7) In the largest reported study of laboratory-confirmed hospitalized patients (*n* = 683, Saudi Arabia 2000–2001) hemorrhagic complications included thrombocytopenia (38.4%); hematemesis (3.6%); petechiae (2.8%); melena (1.8%); epistaxis (1.2%); excessive bleeding from puncture sites (2.4%); and disseminated intravascular coagulation with multiple organ dysfunction, including renal failure (7.5%)[.11](#page-2-10) Laboratory abnormalities included marked elevations of serum transaminases (aspartate transaminase [AST], alanine transaminase [ALT], gamma-glutamyl transferase [GGT]), lactate dehydrogenase (LDH), creatinine phosphokinase (CPK), and creatinine with moderate to severe anemia and marked thrombocytopenia. High virus loads (mean titer, >1.0 × 106 plaque-forming units/mL of blood) are significantly linked to fatal outcomes.[12](#page-2-11) Resolution of the acute phase can be followed 7 to 28 days later by delayed-onset encephalitis.

Frequent mosquito exposure and/or contact with sick livestock in sub-Saharan Africa or the western Arabian Peninsula should

raise a high index of suspicion for Rift Valley fever[.13](#page-2-12) Initial Rift Valley fever presentation is often non-specific and similar to severe malaria, leptospirosis, or other viral hemorrhagic fevers, including Ebola, Marburg, Crimean-Congo hemorrhagic fever, Lassa fever, yellow fever, or dengue fever. Patient contact with ticks, rodents, bats, and non-human primates is not thought to be a significant risk factor for Rift Valley fever and may be more indicative of Crimean-Congo hemorrhagic fever (ticks) or leptospirosis and Lassa (rodents) or Ebola and Marburg (bats and non-human primates).

Diagnosis can be accomplished by serology and nucleic acid amplification testing (reverse-transcription polymerase chain reaction [RT-PCR]) or virus isolation from whole blood or serum, or serologically by various immunoglobulin M and immunoglobulin G antibody detection techniques (enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay [ELISA]). Post-mortem tissues can be submitted for immunohistochemical staining. Due to safety concerns, post-mortem examinations should be performed only after consultation with national diagnostic reference centers. Handling of non-inactivated laboratory specimens and live-virus culture should only be performed in Biosafety Level (BSL)-3– or BSL-4–capable laboratories by trained personnel. RVFV is labile, and decontamination can be accomplished by use of strong detergents or 10% solutions of sodium hypochlorite (bleach).

#### **TREATMENT AND PREVENTION**

Treatment of Rift Valley fever patients is primarily symptomatic, although novel antiviral therapeutics are under development[.14](#page-2-6) For the majority of patients, the disease is self-limiting. Drugs that may have potential hepatotoxic, nephrotoxic, or negative effects on coagulation factors and platelet function should be avoided. Ribavirin, a guanosine analog, is a potent antiviral drug and may be of benefit among severely affected Rift Valley fever patients[.15](#page-2-13) However, an efficacy trial undertaken during the Rift Valley fever outbreak in Saudi Arabia in 2000 was terminated

because of adverse events. The data were suggestive that ribavirin may potentiate the neurologic form of Rift Valley fever. Pharmacokinetic studies have shown that the drug has poor central nervous system penetration, and Rift Valley fever animal models also suggest that treatment increases the risk of delayed-onset neurologic complications. A safe and effective formalin-inactivated vaccine was developed for human use in the 1970s but is no longer available. In the United States one veterinary vaccine is registered for emergency use under direction of national agriculture authorities only. Other live-attenuated veterinary vaccines are available for use in endemic areas but are contraindicated in young or pregnant animals as a result of teratogenic and abortifacient properties. Several additional novel human and veterinary vaccine candidates (recombinant live-attenuated, virus-like particle, DNA-based, and subunit approaches) are under development, but none are commercially available at this time.
