    "Answer": "Cutaneous larva migrans (creeping eruption) - The traveler presents with intensely itchy serpiginous skin eruptions on thighs after returning from Asia and Australia. The images show characteristic raised, erythematous, serpiginous (snake-like) tracks on skin and hookworm larvae. This condition results from cutaneous penetration and migration of animal hookworm larvae (typically dog/cat Ancylostoma species) acquired from contaminated sandy beaches or soil."
