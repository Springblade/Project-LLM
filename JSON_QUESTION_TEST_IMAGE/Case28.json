    "Answer": "Loiasis (Loa loa infection/African eye worm) - The expatriate patient presents with palpitations and migratory transient subcutaneous swellings (Calabar swellings). The images show the adult worm migrating across the conjunctiva (eye worm) and microfilariae on blood smear. Loa loa is transmitted by deer flies in Central Africa, causing characteristic migratory angioedema and occasional cardiac symptoms from microfilaremia."
