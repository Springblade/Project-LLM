    "Answer": "Disseminated melioidosis - The diabetic rice farmer presents during rainy season with prolonged fever, jaundice, back abscess, and pneumonia in Laos, highly endemic for Burkholderia pseudomallei. The images show multiple organ abscesses and characteristic bipolar-staining gram-negative bacilli. Poorly controlled diabetes is a major risk factor for severe disseminated melioidosis with multiple organ involvement including pneumonia, liver, and soft tissue abscesses."
