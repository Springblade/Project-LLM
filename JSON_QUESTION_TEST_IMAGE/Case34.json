    "Answer": "Sporotrichosis (lymphocutaneous form) - The farmer from Peru presents with chronic ulcerative lesion and multiple painless nodules along lymphatic distribution on the hand. The images show sporotrichoid spread (linear nodular lesions) and cigar-shaped yeast forms of Sporothrix schenckii on microscopy. This dimorphic fungal infection is acquired through traumatic inoculation from soil, plants, or thorns, classically in rose gardeners or farmers."
