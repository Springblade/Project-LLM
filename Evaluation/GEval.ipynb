While there, the man tracked chimpanzees and gorillas, and visited the Marangambo Forest python cave. Fruit bats were flying in and out of the cave, but he was not touched, bitten, or scratched by the bats. Later, he ate goat stew containing intestine at a local hotel and swam in a local lake. No one fell ill during the trip. The man developed fever 12 days after visiting the python cave, 11 days after eating goat stew, and 10 days after lake swimming. Prior to travel, he was vaccinated against hepatitis A, polio, typhoid, and yellow fever. He took doxycycline as malaria prophylaxis, but admits to missing a couple of doses.

In 2018, the patient experienced a similar episode involving the right lower extremity, during which surgical debridement and primary closure by podiatry were performed. This was followed by a two-week course of trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole (TMP-SMX) and cefazolin, resulting in complete resolution of symptoms related to coexisting Nocardia spp., methicillin-susceptible Staphylococcus aureus (MSSA), and Streptococcus agalactiae group B infections as confirmed by blood and tissue cultures at that time. The physical exam during his current presentation revealed marked edema of the distal right lower extremity, multiple granulomatous foci, and two well-healed scars along the medial and lateral aspects of the calf, attributable to his previous surgical debridement from 2018 (Figure 1). He had full strength and sensation in the affected extremity without any discernible deficits. There were no signs indicative of a systemic infection, and the patient’s vital signs remained stable.

      "\n",
      "1. Hepatitis B: The patient's symptoms, laboratory tests showing elevated liver enzymes and bilirubin levels, and the absence of other causes of liver failure suggest a diagnosis of hepatitis B. The positive anti-HCV test and negative HCV RNA load further support this diagnosis.\n",
      "\n",
      "2. Chronic Liver Disease: The patient's history of fatigue, poor appetite, and dark urine, along with the physical examination findings and laboratory results, are consistent with chronic liver disease. The presence of a solitary liver mass on imaging and elevated CA19-9 levels also support this diagnosis.\n",

      "  - input: A 58 year old man presented at the emergency room with a two‐day history of headache, sore throat, cough, and fever. He had a past medical history of uncontrolled diabetes mellitus, hypertension, bronchial asthma, and chronic otitis media. He required an automastoidectomy for the chronic otitis media, complicated by a tegmen tympani defect and secondary pseudomeningocele formation communicating with the left temporal horn He had bacterial meningitis 6 years ago, complicated by hydrocephalus that required a temporary external ventricular shunt placement. The patient was initially managed as a case of upper respiratory tract infection and discharged on the same day with a course of oral antibiotics. He returned to the emergency room 1 day later because of worsening headache and vomiting associated with altered sensorium. The patient was well built but sick‐looking. His systolic blood pressure was 160/75 mm Hg, heart rate 110 beats/min, respiratory rate 27/min, the temperature 38°C, and oxygen saturation 96% at room air. His initial neurological examination revealed no eye‐opening to pain, and he produced sounds only as a verbal response. His pupils' size was 4 mm and reactive to light, and he blinked to a threat in both eyes. With the fundus examination, there was bilateral papilledema. He had a normal vestibulo‐ocular reflex, positive corneal reflex, no facial asymmetry, the gag reflex was preserved, and in response to painful stimulus on the sternum, he showed withdrawal response bilaterally. He had nuchal rigidity with positive Brudzinski and Kernig signs. His arterial blood gas results showed a pH of 7.512, pCO2 of 30.8 mmHg, pO2 of 80.2 mmHg, and an HCO3 of 24.1 nmol/L. The laboratory results were significant with the WBC count of 13,000 cells/μL, the lactic acid was 2.49 mmol/L (0.5–2.2 mmol/L), and the potassium was 2.7 mmol/L (3.6–5.2 mmol/L).* The other laboratory parameters including hemoglobin, platelets, renal function, liver function, coagulation profile and cardiac enzymes were within normal limits. Initial brain computerized tomography (CT) scan showed no significant abnormality. Following the brain CT, a lumbar puncture was performed. The appearance of the CSF was a thick yellow liquid resembling pus (Figure 2). The CSF WBC count was 158,000 cells/μL (0–5 cells/μL), the CSF protein 18.67 mg/mL (0.15 to 0.6 mg/mL), the CSF lactic acid 42.37 mmol/L (0–3 mmol/L), the CSF glucose 0.1 mg/100 mL (50–80 mg/100 mL), the CSF RBCs were less than 1 RBC/mm3 (<1 RBC/mm3), and the CSF culture indicated S. pneumoniae (see endnote 1). He was started on a regimen with intravenous meropenem 2000 mg every 8 h and intravenous vancomycin 1200 mg every 8 h, and dexamethasone 12 mg every 6 h. He was also given one dose of intravenous metronidazole 1200 mg once. Intravenous ceftriaxone 2000 mg every 12 h was also added to the regimen. Due to respiratory failure, he was intubated with an endotracheal tube and transferred to an intensive care unit. On the second day of admission, his level of consciousness deteriorated, and his Glasgow Coma Scale (GCS) was 3 out of 15. A repeated brain CT scan showed multiple hypodensities and brain venogram revealed multiple filling defects in the superior sagittal sinus and left transverse sinus (Figure 3). The brain magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) showed extensive gyriform diffusion restriction abnormality involving the frontal, anterior temporal lobes, insular cortices, and bilateral deep gray nuclei and brainstem suggestive of meningoencephalitis with gyriform hemorrhagic foci in the insula and frontal lobes Multiple small collections were also noted along the leptomeningeal surface of the brain stem and cerebellar convexities representing exudates.\n",

The patient had a history of bacterial meningitis and hydrocephalus, and the clinical presentation included fever, headache, altered sensorium, and papilledema. The laboratory findings, including a high WBC count, low potassium, and low CSF glucose, as well as the positive CSF culture for S. pneumoniae, supported the diagnosis of bacterial meningitis. The imaging studies, including brain CT and MRI, showed multiple hypodensities and brain venogram filling defects, consistent with brain abscesses and meningoencephalitis. The patient was treated with antibiotics and dexamethasone, and the final diagnosis was confirmed by the clinical response to treatment and the resolution of the imaging findings.\n",
