He had no known medical comorbidities or allergies. He was originally from Bolivia but had lived in Europe for the last 15 years (Ireland for the past year). The patient worked as a mechanic, had no pets, no recent travel history and no unusual contacts or hobbies. In the preceding 4 weeks and prior to his deterioration, he had presented on two separate occasions to a hospital emergency department \u2013 once to hospital A and once to hospital B, a different hospital in the city. At the first visit, which was to hospital A, the patient reported a mild headache, which responded to analgesia with no red flag symptoms. Blood tests were taken, including a routine opt-out bloodborne viral (BBV) screen. The patient was discharged from the ED. The BBV screen was subsequently reported as reactive for HIV antigen and antibody. Multiple unsuccessful attempts were made by staff to contact the patient by telephone and post. Two weeks later, the patient was brought back to the emergency department of hospital A. He presented with reduced consciousness. The patient\u2019s housemates, who accompanied him to the hospital, reported worsening drowsiness over the preceding days. On initial examination, Glasgow Coma Scale (GCS) was 12/15, with unequal pupils. His temperature was 40.0\u00b0C and his heart rate was 120 beats per minute. Initial oxygen saturation was 99% in room air. One hour after presentation, GCS deteriorated from 12 to 6. Due to worsening level of consciousness and onset of respiratory failure, he was intubated and transferred to the intensive care unit (ICU). Initial blood tests showed lymphopaenia of 0.6 x 109/L (1.5-3.5 109/L), Hb 10.5g/dL (13.5 \u2013 18g/dL), and CRP 59 mg/L (0.00 \u2013 5.00mg/L). A chest radiograph showed diffuse, patchy opacification bilaterally. A brain CT showed multiple supratentorial ring-enhancing lesions bilaterally, with significant associated cerebral oedema and rightward midline shift. The patient was commenced on empiric therapy for meningitis (ceftriaxone, amoxicillin, and vancomycin) and cerebral toxoplasmosis (sulfadiazine and pyrimethamine, with folinic acid). Thoracic CT was also performed, which showed findings suggestive of Pneumocystis jirovecii pneumonia (PJP); cotrimoxazole was commenced.",

            "Text": "A 56-year-old otherwise healthy Guatemalan male landscaper presented to the emergency room with complaints of worsening swelling and pain in his right lower extremity over the past two months, accompanied by multiple raised and indurated lesions at various stages of healing along the right posteriomedial calf. In 2018, the patient experienced a similar episode involving the right lower extremity, during which surgical debridement and primary closure by podiatry were performed. This was followed by a two-week course of trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole (TMP-SMX) and cefazolin, resulting in complete resolution of symptoms related to coexisting Nocardia spp., methicillin-susceptible Staphylococcus aureus (MSSA), and Streptococcus agalactiae group B infections as confirmed by blood and tissue cultures at that time. The physical exam during his current presentation revealed marked edema of the distal right lower extremity, multiple granulomatous foci, and two well-healed scars along the medial and lateral aspects of the calf, attributable to his previous surgical debridement from 2018 (Figure 1). He had full strength and sensation in the affected extremity without any discernible deficits. There were no signs indicative of a systemic infection, and the patient\u2019s vital signs remained stable. A computed tomography (CT) scan was completed, showing superficial compartment edema of the posterior distal lower extremity, along with an irregular heterogenous collection in the posteriomedial calf (Figure 2). Given the uncertainty regarding deep compartment involvement and the high suspicion of a developing abscess due to a recurrent Nocardia spp. infection, the patient was subsequently taken to the operating room. The final surgical pathology from the biopsied lesions and muscle indicated small clusters of thin filiform bacteria, which stained positively for Gram and Ziehl-Neelsen, most consistent with an actinomycetoma.",

        "base_model_answer": "The most likely disease diagnosis for this patient is actinomycosis. Actinomycosis is a fungal infection caused by Actinomyces israelii, which is a type of actinomycete. The patient's symptoms, including multiple granulomatous foci and scars from previous surgical debridement, are consistent with the clinical presentation of actinomycosis. The presence of Gram-positive bacteria in the biopsy specimen also supports the diagnosis of actinomycosis."
