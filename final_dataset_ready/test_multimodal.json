These include primary or metastatic brain tumors (e.g., glioblastoma, cerebral metastases), cerebral abscesses (bacterial, fungal, or parasitic), tuberculomas, or other parasitic infections like neurocysticercosis (though typically more common with *Taenia solium*). The ring-enhancing pattern is common to many of these, but the \"tunnel sign\" on MRI, an elongated, migratory appearance, strongly points towards a parasitic infection like sparganosis, distinguishing it from non-migratory lesions such as most tumors or abscesses."

Other important differential diagnoses include *Neisseria meningitidis* meningitis with meningococcemia, which classically presents with a similar purpuric rash and septic shock. Melioidosis, given her history of type 2 diabetes (HbA1c 8.5%) and residence in a tropical region, should also be considered as it can cause sepsis and encephalitis, although it is less commonly reported in Vietnam.

Despite the provided CT scan `_page_2_Picture_2.jpeg` showing no structural abnormalities, chronic pain can lead to deconditioning and decreased physical activity. A comprehensive follow-up strategy would involve regular consultations with a rheumatologist for ongoing assessment and management of joint symptoms, including consideration of disease-modifying anti-rheumatic drugs (DMARDs) if an inflammatory arthropathy is confirmed. Continued collaboration with a tropical medicine specialist is essential to rule out other persistent infections and to counsel on the natural history of post-infectious syndromes. Physical therapy and psychological support are also crucial components of multidisciplinary care to address both physical and mental well-being."

Concurrently, a nuchal skin biopsy for viral RNA by RT-PCR can significantly aid diagnosis. While serological diagnosis has limited utility in the first week, detecting rabies-specific antibodies in serum or CSF (especially in an unvaccinated individual, or if survival is prolonged beyond a week) can also support the diagnosis. Prompt execution of these tests is vital for definitive confirmation and infection control."

P. knowlesi is known for its rapid asexual cycle, morphological similarity to P. malariae (band forms, compact trophozoites) in older stages, and often presenting with prominent ring forms similar to P. falciparum in early stages, making microscopic differentiation challenging.

RDTs have reduced sensitivity for non-falciparum species, and a prozone phenomenon can lead to false negatives in cases of very high falciparum parasitaemia, or in patients infected with P. knowlesi which might not be reliably detected by pan-malarial aldolase, especially at lower parasite densities or in early infection.

This includes maintaining hydration and nutrition, potentially with intravenous fluids if oral intake remains difficult due to painful oral lesions. Antipyretics like paracetamol (acetaminophen) at 500-1000 mg orally every 4-6 hours as needed would be administered for fever (38°C) and malaise. Good oral hygiene and analgesics for oral pain are crucial. Monitoring for secondary bacterial infections of the skin lesions, especially given the elevated ESR of 75 mm/h, and providing appropriate antibiotics if signs of infection develop, would also be part of the comprehensive care plan."

During recovery, monitoring for secondary bacterial skin infections, which could lead to cellulitis or even sepsis, is important, especially given the initial elevated ESR of 75 mm/h. In the long term, potential complications include scarring and post-inflammatory hyperpigmentation, particularly on the face and hands, which can be disfiguring. Although rare, central nervous system complications or ocular involvement can also occur, necessitating ongoing neurological or ophthalmological assessment if symptoms arise."

Samples should be collected from the vesicular or pustular fluid, crusts of skin lesions, or biopsies of the lesions shown in _page_0_Picture_10.jpeg. PCR specifically detects monkeypox viral DNA with high sensitivity and specificity. Electron microscopy can also be used to identify poxvirus particles morphologically, but PCR offers superior precision for confirming the exact species, which is crucial for individual patient management and public health surveillance in the Democratic Republic of the Congo."
